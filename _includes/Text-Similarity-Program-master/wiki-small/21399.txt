5.1. .nu Internet domain

The .nu TLD is assigned to Niue.

Niue, through an outside company, registers Internet domain names, so most .nu Web addresses are not actually located in Niue. They are commonly used by Danish, Dutch and Swedish websites, because in those languages 'nu' means “now”.

Niue was the first country in the world to plan on offering free nation-wide WiFi Internet access, using the funds provided by the domain registrations. 95% of Niueans now have Internet access at home, work or through the schools, making it the country with the highest per capita internet penetration in the world.
