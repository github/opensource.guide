A millisecond (from milli- and second; symbol: ms) is a thousandth (10−3 or 1/1,000) of a second.

10 milliseconds (a hundredth of a second) are called a centisecond, commonly seen on many stopwatches but often mistakenly referred to as milliseconds.

100 milliseconds (one tenth of a second) are called a decisecond.

To help compare orders of magnitude of different times, this page lists times between 10蜢3 seconds and 100 seconds (1 milli and one second). See also times of other orders of magnitude.

1. Examples

200 milliseconds — the time it takes the human brain to recognize emotion in facial expressions

250 milliseconds — a sixteenth note at MM = 60

300 to 400 milliseconds — the time for the human eye to blink

400 milliseconds — time in which the fastest baseball pitches reach the strike zone
