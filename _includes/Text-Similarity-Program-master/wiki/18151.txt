A laser is constructed from three principal parts   An energy source  usually referred to as the pump or pump source    A gain medium or laser medium  and  Two or more mirrors that form an optical resonator   1  Pump source  The pump source is the part that provides energy to the laser system  Examples of pump sources include electrical discharges  flashlamps  arc lamps  light from another laser  chemical reactions and even explosive devices  The type of pump source used principally depends on the gain medium  and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium  A helium–neon  HeNe  laser uses an electrical discharge in the helium neon gas mixture  a Nd YAG laser uses either light focused from a xenon flash lamp or diode lasers  and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction   2  Gain medium   Laser medium  The gain medium is the major determining factor of the wavelength of operation  and other properties  of the laser  Gain media in different materials have linear spectra or wide spectra  Gain media with wide spectra allow tuning of the laser frequency  First wide tunable crystal laser with tunabulity more octave represent on photo 3   spie org x39922 xml   There are hundreds if not thousands of different gain media in which laser operation has been achieved  see list of laser types for a list of the most important ones   The gain medium is excited by the pump source to produce a population inversion  and it is in the gain medium that spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons takes place  leading to the phenomenon of optical gain  or amplification   Examples of different gain media include   Liquids  such as dye lasers  These are usually organic chemical solvents  such as methanol  ethanol or ethylene glycol  to which are added chemical dyes such as coumarin  rhodamine  and fluorescein  The exact chemical configuration of the dye molecules determines the operation wavelength of the dye laser   Gases  such as carbon dioxide  argon  krypton and mixtures such as helium舑neon  These lasers are often pumped by electrical discharge   Solids  such as crystals and glasses  The solid host materials are usually doped with an impurity such as chromium  neodymium  erbium or titanium ions  Typical hosts include YAG  yttrium aluminium garnet   YLF  yttrium lithium fluoride   sapphire  aluminium oxide  and various glasses  Examples of solid state laser media include Nd YAG  Ti sapphire  Cr sapphire  usually known as ruby   Cr LiSAF  chromium doped lithium strontium aluminium fluoride   Er YLF  Nd glass  and Er glass  Solid state lasers are usually pumped by flashlamps or light from another laser   Semiconductors  a type of solid  crystal with uniform dopant distribution or material with differing dopant levels in which the movement of electrons can cause laser action  Semiconductor lasers are typically very small  and can be pumped with a simple electric current  enabling them to be used in consumer devices such as compact disc players  See laser diode   3  Optical resonator  The optical resonator  or optical cavity  in its simplest form is two parallel mirrors placed around the gain medium which provide feedback of the light  The mirrors are given optical coatings which determine their reflective properties  Typically one will be a high reflector  and the other will be a partial reflector  The latter is called the output coupler  because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser s output beam   Light from the medium  produced by spontaneous emission  is reflected by the mirrors back into the medium  where it may be amplified by stimulated emission  The light may reflect from the mirrors and thus pass through the gain medium many hundreds of times before exiting the cavity  In more complex lasers  configurations with four or more mirrors forming the cavity are used  The design and alignment of the mirrors with respect to the medium is crucial to determining the exact operating wavelength and other attributes of the laser system   Other optical devices  such as spinning mirrors  modulators  filters  and absorbers  may be placed within the optical resonator to produce a variety of effects on the laser output  such as altering the wavelength of operation or the production of pulses of laser light   Some lasers do not use an optical cavity  but instead rely on very high optical gain to produce significant amplified spontaneous emission  ASE  without needing feedback of the light back into the gain medium  Such lasers are said to be superluminescent  and emit light with low coherence but high bandwidth  Since they do not use optical feedback  these devices are often not categorized as lasers   4  See also  Injection seeder  Mode locking  Q switching  List of laser articles  5  References  Koechner  Walter  1992   Solid State Laser Engineering  3rd ed   Springer Verlag  ISBN 0 387 53756 2  6  External links  A Practical Guide to Lasers for Experimenters and Hobbyists
