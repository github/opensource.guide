Rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep gradient  causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence  Rapids are hydrological features between a run  a smoothly flowing part of a stream  and a cascade  Rapids are characterised by the river becoming shallower with some rocks exposed above the flow surface  As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks  air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour  forming what is called  whitewater   Rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the erosive power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids  Very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length   Rapids are categorized in classes  generally running from I to VI  A Class 5 rapid may be categorized as Class 5 1 5 9  While class I rapids are easy to negotiate and require no maneuvering  class VI rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue   1  See also  Fluid dynamics  International Scale of River Difficulty   for classification of rapids   Reach  geography   Rheophile   organisms that live in fast flowing water   Riffle   A fast moving portion of a stream without the vigour of a rapid  Whitewater   for factors related to rapids  2  References  3  External links
