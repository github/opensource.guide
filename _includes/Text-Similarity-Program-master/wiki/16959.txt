Katyusha multiple rocket launchers    are a type of rocket artillery first built and fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II  Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver a devastating amount of explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery  but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload  They are fragile compared to artillery guns  but are inexpensive and easy to produce  Katyushas of World War II  the first self propelled artillery mass produced by the Soviet Union  were usually mounted on trucks  This mobility gave the Katyusha  and other self propelled artillery  another advantage  being able to deliver a large blow all at once  and then move before being located and attacked with counter battery fire   Katyusha weapons of World War II included the BM 13 launcher  light BM 8  and heavy BM 31  Today  the nickname is also applied to newer truck mounted Soviet  and not only Soviet  multiple rocket launchers—notably the common BM 21—and derivatives   1  Nickname  Initially  concerns for secrecy kept their military designation from being known by the soldiers who operated them  They were called by code names such as Kostikov guns  after the head of the RNII  the Reaction Engine Scientific Research Institute   and finally classed as Guards Mortars  The name BM 13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942  and remained classified until after the war   Because they were marked with the letter K  for Voronezh Komintern Factory   Red Army troops adopted a nickname from Mikhail Isakovsky s popular wartime song   Katyusha   about a girl longing for her absent beloved  who has gone away on military service  Katyusha is the Russian equivalent of Katie  an endearing diminutive form of the name Katherine  Yekaterina →Katya →Katyusha   German troops coined the sobriquet Stalin s organ     after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin  prompted by the visual resemblance of the launch array to a church organ and the sound of the weapon s rocket motors  Weapons of this type are known by the same name in Denmark     Finland     France     Norway     the Netherlands     Hungary     and in Sweden        The heavy BM 31 launcher was also referred to as Andryusha  Андрюша  an affectionate diminutive of  Andrew    But in fact  only the Soviet press used this name   2  World War II  Katyusha rocket launchers invented in Voronezh  were mounted on many platforms during World War II  including on trucks  artillery tractors  tanks  and armoured trains  as well as on naval and riverine vessels as assault support weapons  Soviet engineers also mounted single Katyusha rockets on lengths of railway track to serve in urban combat   The design was relatively simple  consisting of racks of parallel rails on which rockets were mounted  with a folding frame to raise the rails to launch position  Each truck had 14 to 48 launchers  The M 13 rocket of the BM 13 system was long  in diameter and weighed    The weapon is less accurate than conventional artillery guns  but is extremely effective in saturation bombardment  and was particularly feared by German soldiers  A battery of four BM 13 launchers could fire a salvo in 7–10 seconds that delivered 4 35 tons of high explosives over a impact zone  making its power roughly equivalent to that of 72 guns  With an efficient crew  the launchers could redeploy to a new location immediately after firing  denying the enemy the opportunity for counterbattery fire  Katyusha batteries were often massed in very large numbers to create a shock effect on enemy forces  The weapon s disadvantage was the long time it took to reload a launcher  in contrast to conventional guns which could sustain a continuous low rate of fire   The distinctive howling sound of the rocket launching terrified the German troops and could be used for psychological warfare  The rocket s devastating destruction also helped to lower the morale of the German army   2 1  Development  In June 1938  the Soviet Jet Propulsion Research Institute  RNII  in Leningrad was authorized by the Main Artillery Directorate  GAU  to develop a multiple rocket launcher for the RS 132 aircraft rocket  RS for    rocket powered shell    I  Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk  Russia  which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132 mm M 132 rockets over the sides of ZiS 5 trucks  These proved unstable  and V N  Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally  In August 1939  the result was the BM 13  BM stands for Боевая Mашина  translit  Boyevaya Mashina    combat vehicle  for M 13 rockets    The first large scale testing of the rocket launchers took place at the end of 1938  when 233 rounds of various types were used  A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of 5 500 metres  3 4 mi   But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha  because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds  while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time  Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940  and the BM 13 16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production  Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941   After their success in the first month of the war  mass production was ordered and the development of other models proceeded  The Katyusha was inexpensive and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels  By the end of 1942  3 237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built  and by the end of the war total production reached about 10 000   The truck mounted Katyushas were installed on ZiS 6 6×4 trucks  as well as the two axle ZiS 5 and ZiS 5V  In 1941  a small number of BM 13 launchers were mounted on STZ 5 artillery tractors  A few were also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV 1K  but this was a needless waste of heavy armour  Starting in 1942  they were also mounted on various British  Canadian and U S  Lend Lease trucks  in which case they were sometimes referred to as BM 13S  The cross country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½ ton truck was so good that it became the GAU s standard mounting in 1943  designated BM 13N  normalizovanniy   standardized    and more than 1 800 of this model were manufactured by the end of World War II  After World War II  BM 13s were based on Soviet built ZiL 151 trucks   The 82 mm BM 8 was approved in August 1941  and deployed as the BM 8 36 on truck beds and BM 8 24 on T 40 and T 60 light tank chassis  Later these were also installed on GAZ 67 jeeps as the BM 8 8  and on the larger Studebaker trucks as the BM 8 48  In 1942  the team of scientists Leonid Shvarts  Moisei Komissarchik and engineer Yakov Shor received the Stalin prize for the development of the BM 8 48   Based on the M 13  the M 30 rocket was developed in 1942  Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame  called the M 30  single frame  four round  later double frame  8 round   instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck  In 1944 it became the basis for the BM 31 12 truck mounted launcher   A battery of BM 13 16 launchers included four firing vehicles  two reload trucks and two technical support trucks  with each firing vehicle having a crew of six  Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes  although the standard procedure was to switch to a new position some 10 km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy  Three batteries were combined into a division  company   and three divisions into a separate mine firing regiment of rocket artillery   2 2  Variants  Soviet World War II missile systems were named according standard templates which are the following   BM x y  names used for ground vehicles   M x y  names used for towed trailers and sledges   y M x  names used for navy  where   x is a model of a missile   y is a number of launch rails tubes  In particular  BM 8 16 is a vehicle which fires M 8 missiles and has 16 rails  BM 30 4 is a vehicle which fires M 30 missiles and has 4 launch tubes  Short names such as BM 8 or BM 13 were used too  Number of launch rails tubes is absent here  Such names describe launchers only no matter a vehicle they are mounted on  In particular BM 8 24 had a number of variants  vehicle mounted  ZiS 5 truck   tank mounted  T 40  and tractor mounted  STZ 3   All of them had the same name  BM 8 24  Other launchers had a number of variants mounted on different vehicles too  Typical set of vehicles for soviet missile systems is the following   ZiS 5  truck    ZiS 6  truck    GAZ AA  truck    STZ 3  tractor    T 40  tank    Studebaker US6  truck    Armored train car   River boat   Towed sledge   Towed trailer   Backpack  portable variant  so called  mountain Katyusha     ZiS 151  truck  used after the war   Note  There was also an experimental KV 1K – Katyusha mounted on KV 1 tank which was not taken in service   A list of some implementations of the Katyusha follows   2 3  Rocket variants  Rockets used in the above implementations were   The M 8 and M 13 rocket could also be fitted with smoke warheads  although this was not common   2 4  Combat history  The multiple rocket launchers were top secret in the beginning of World War II  A special unit of the NKVD secret police was raised to operate them  On July 14  1941  an experimental artillery battery of seven launchers was first used in battle at Rudnya in Smolensk province of Russia  under the command of Captain Ivan Flyorov  destroying a concentration of German troops with tanks  armored vehicles and trucks at the marketplace  causing massive German Army casualties and its retreat from the town in panic  Following the success  the Red Army organized new Guards mortar batteries for the support of infantry divisions  A battery s complement was standardized at four launchers  They remained under NKVD control until German Nebelwerfer rocket launchers became common later in the war   On August 8  1941  Stalin ordered the formation of eight special Guards mortar regiments under the direct control of the General Headquarters Reserve  Stavka VGK   Each regiment comprised three battalions of three batteries  totalling 36 BM 13 or BM 8 launchers  Independent Guards mortar battalions were also formed  comprising 12 launchers in three batteries of four  By the end of 1941  there were eight regiments  35 independent battalions  and two independent batteries in service  fielding a total of 554 launchers   In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions were formed around the new M 30 static rocket launch frames  consisting of 96 launchers in three batteries  In July  a battalion of BM 13s was added to the establishment of a tank corps  In 1944  the BM 31 was used in motorized heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 launchers  In 1943  Guards mortar brigades  and later divisions  were formed equipped with static launchers   By the end of 1942  57 regiments were in service—together with the smaller independent battalions  this was the equivalent of 216 batteries  21% BM 8 light launchers  56% BM 13  and 23% M 30 heavy launchers  By the end of the war  the equivalent of 518 batteries were in service   3  Post war development  The success and economy of multiple rocket launchers  MRL  have led them to continue to be developed  During the Cold War  the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha like MRL  notably the BM 21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon  and the larger BM 27  Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha type multiple launch rocket systems  including bomblet submunitions  remotely deployed land mines  and chemical warheads   With the breakup of the Soviet Union  Russia inherited most of its military arsenal including its large complement of MRLs  In recent history  they have been used by Russian forces during the First and Second Chechen Wars and by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno Karabakh War  Georgian government forces are reported to indiscriminately have used BM 21 or similar rocket artillery in fighting in the 2008 South Ossetia war   Katyusha like launchers were exported to Afghanistan  Angola  Czechoslovakia  Egypt  East Germany  Hungary  Iran  Iraq  North Korea  Poland  Syria  and Vietnam  They were also built in Czechoslovakia  the People s Republic of China  North Korea  and Iran   Proper Katyushas  BM 13s  also saw action in the Korean War  used by the Chinese People s Volunteer Army against the South and United Nations forces  Soviet BM 13s were known to have been imported to China before the Sino Soviet split and were operational in the People s Liberation Army   Israel captured BM 24 MRLs during the Six Day War  1967   used them in two battalions during the Yom Kippur War  1973  and the 1982 Lebanon War  and later developed the MAR 240 launcher for the same rockets  based on a Sherman tank chassis   During the 2006 Lebanon War  Hezbollah fired between 3 970 and 4 228 rockets  from light truck mounts and single rail man portable launchers  About 95% of these were 122 mm  4 8 in  Syrian manufactured M 21OF type artillery rockets which carried warheads up to 30 kg  66 lb  and had a range of 20 km  perhaps up to 30 km  19 mi   Hamas has launched 122 mm Grad type Katyusha rockets from the Gaza Strip against several cities in Israel  although they are not reported to have truck mounted launchers  Although Katyusha originally referred to the mobile launcher  today the rockets are often referred to as Katyushas   Some allege that the CIA bought Katyushas from the Egyptian military and supplied them to the Mujahideen  via Pakistan s ISI  during the Soviet Afghan war   Katyusha like MRLs were also allegedly used by the Rwandan Patriotic Front during its 1990 invasion of Rwanda  through the 1994 genocide  They were effective in battle  but translated into much anti Tutsi sentiment in the local media   It was reported that BM 21 launchers were used against American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq  They have also been used in the Afghanistan and Iraq insurgencies  In Iraq  according to Associated Press and Agence France Presse reports  Katyusha like rockets were fired at the Green Zone late March 2008   Katyusha rockets were reportedly used by both Gaddafi Loyalists and anti Gaddafi forces during the Libyan Civil War   Also  several countries have continued to build and operate Katyusha like systems well into the 21st century  as for example the Teruel MRL of the Spanish Army   In February 2013  the Defense Ministry of Yemen reported seizing an Iranian ship  and that the ship s cargo included  among its other weapons  Katyusha rockets   The Russian army has mounted some multiple rocket launchers on turretless T 72 tanks and called the weapon a TOS 1  These were developed in the 1980s  but have been modernized and are in very limited service   4  See also  Hwacha  Korean gunpowder based flaming arrow launcher from the 1500s  Congreve rocket  British military
