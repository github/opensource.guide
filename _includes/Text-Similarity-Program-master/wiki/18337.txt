The last rites are the last prayers and ministrations given to many Catholics when possible shortly before death  The last rites go by various names and include different practices in different Catholic traditions  They may be administered to those awaiting execution  mortally injured  or terminally ill   1  In the Latin Catholic church  The ministration known as the last rites in the Catholic Church does not constitute a distinct sacrament in itself  It is rather a set of sacraments given to people who are believed to be near death  These are the sacraments of Anointing of the Sick  which  in spite of not being reserved for those near death  is sometimes mistakenly supposed to be what is meant by  the last rites    Penance and the Eucharist  If all three are administered immediately one after another  the normal order of administration is  first Penance then Anointing  then Viaticum   The last rites are meant to prepare the dying person s soul for death  by providing absolution for sins by penance  sacramental grace and prayers for the relief of suffering through anointing  and the final administration of the Eucharist  known as  Viaticum   which is Latin for  provision for the journey    Reception of the Eucharist in this form is the only sacrament essentially associated with dying  Accordingly   the celebration of the Eucharist as Viaticum is the sacrament proper to the dying Christian   In the Roman Ritual s Pastoral Care of the Sick  Rites of Anointing and Viaticum  Viaticum is the only sacrament dealt with in Part II  Pastoral Care of the Dying   Within that part  the chapter on Viaticum is followed by two more chapters  one on Commendation of the Dying  with short texts  mainly from the Bible  a special form of the litany of the saints  and other prayers  and the other on Prayers for the Dead  A final chapter provides Rites for Exceptional Circumstances  namely  the Continuous Rite of Penance  Anointing  and Viaticum  Rite for Emergencies  and Christian Initiation for the Dying  The last of these concerns the administration of Baptism and Confirmation to those who have not received these sacraments   In addition  the priest has authority to bestow a blessing in the name of the Pope on the dying person  to which a plenary indulgence is attached   In case of an individual awaiting execution  the person would receive Confession and Viaticum  Without having to fear death by illness  they cannot partake Anointing of the sick   2  Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches  In the Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Rite of Constantinople  the last rites consist of the Sacred Mysteries  sacraments  of Confession and the reception of Holy Communion   Following these sacraments  when a person dies  there are a series of prayers known as The Office at the Parting of the Soul From the Body  This consists of a blessing by the priest  the usual beginning  and after the Lord s Prayer  Psalm 50  Then a Canon to the Theotokos is chanted  entitled   On behalf of a man whose soul is departing  and who cannot speak   This is an elongated poem speaking in the person of the one who is dying  asking for forgiveness of sin  the mercy of God  and the intercession of the saints  The rite is concluded by three prayers said by the priest  the last one being said  at the departure of the soul    There is an alternative rite known as The Office at the Parting of the Soul from the Body When a Man has Suffered for a Long Time  The outline of this rite is the same as above  except that Psalm 70 and Psalm 143 precede Psalm 50  and the words of the canon and the prayers are different   The rubric in the Book of Needs  priest s service book  states   With respect to the Services said at the parting of the soul  we note that if time does not permit to read the whole Canon  then customarily just one of the prayers  found at the end of the Canon  is read by the Priest at the moment of the parting of the soul from the body    As soon as the person has died the priest begins The Office After the Departure of the Soul From the Body  also known as The First Pannikhida    In the Orthodox Church Holy Unction is not considered to be solely a part of a person s preparation for death  but is administered to any Orthodox Christian who is ill  physically or spiritually  to ask for God s mercy and forgiveness of sin  There is an abbreviated form of Holy Unction to be performed for a person in imminent danger of death  which does not replace the full rite in other cases   3  See also  Anointing  Deathbed confession  Excommunication  Salat al Janazah  4  References  5  External links  article in The Catholic Encyclopedia  1909   article in The Catholic Encyclopedia  1909   es Sacramento de la unción de los enfermos
