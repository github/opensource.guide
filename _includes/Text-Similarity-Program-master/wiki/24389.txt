Public relations  PR  is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization  such as a business  government agency  or a nonprofit organization  and the public  Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment  This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications  The aim of public relations is to inform the public  prospective customers  investors  partners  employees  and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them maintain a certain view about the organization  its leadership  products  or of political decisions  Public relations professionals typically work for PR firms  businesses and companies  government  government agencies  and public officials as PIOs  and nongovernmental organizations and nonprofit organizations   Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organization s target audience  the media  and other opinion leaders  Common activities include designing communications campaigns  writing news releases and other content for news and feature articles  working with the press  arranging interviews for company spokespeople  writing speeches for company leaders  acting as organization s spokesperson by speaking in public and public officials  preparing clients for press conferences  media interviews  and speeches  writing website and social media content  and facilitating internal employee communication  Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each the client s many publics  The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade  which is publicity   1  Definition  Ivy Lee and Edward Louis Bernays established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows   a management function  which tabulates public attitudes  defines the policies  procedures  and interests of an organization    followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance   However  when PR pioneer Ivy Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the United Transit Commission  he said  I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do   In 1948  historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster s would be  disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field    According to Edward Bernays  the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness  Furthermore  he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support   In August 1978  the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as   the art and social science of analyzing trends  predicting their consequences  counseling organizational leaders  and implementing planned programs of action  which will serve both the organization and the public interest   Public Relations Society of America  a professional trade association  defined public relations in 1982 as    Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other   In 2011 and 2012  the PRSA developed a crowd sourced definition    Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics   Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing communication between an organization and its publics   2  History  Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession  However academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations  during the settling of the New World and during the movement to abolish slavery in England  Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the United Kingdom for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924  though academic Noel Turnball believes PR was founded in Britain first by evangelicals and Victorian reformers   Propaganda was used by the United States  the United Kingdom  Germany and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars  which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector  Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays  then spread internationally  Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the Marshall plan   The second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations  Trade associations  PR news magazines  international PR agencies  and academic principles for the profession were established  In the early 2000s  press release services began offering social media press releases  The Cluetrain Manifesto  which predicted the impact of social media in 1999  was controversial in its time  but by 2006  the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted   3  Salaries and growth  According to the U S  News & World Report  the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 2012  the median annual salary for public relations practitioners was $54 170  The top ten percent in the field made about $101 030  and the bottom ten percent made about $30 760   For public relations managers  however  the median annual wage in 2011 was $93 310  Workers in the 90th percentile earned around $176 400  and workers in the 10th percentile earned $50 360  according to the U S  Department of Labor   The U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics also projects an employment growth of 12 percent between 2012 and 2022 for the profession  where an additional 27 400 jobs will need to be filled  The public relations profession has claimed the No  85 spot on the 2014 U S  News & World Report list of Best Jobs because of its promising direction   In the United States  public relations professionals earn an average annual salary of $49 800 which compares with £40 000  $68 880  for a practitioner with a similar job in the UK  Top earners make around $89 220 annually  while entry level public relations specialists earn around $28 080  Corporate  or in house communications is generally more profitable  and communications executives can earn salaries in the mid six figures  though this only applies to a fraction of the sector s workforce   The role of public relations professionals is changing because of the shift from traditional to online media  Many PR professionals are finding it necessary to learn new skills and to understand how social media can impact upon a brand s reputation   4  Tactics  Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual  usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance  primarily to the media  Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders  According to Dr  Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University  public relations professionals can be viewed as  discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing rhetorical strategies to achieve managerial aims    Specific public relations disciplines include   Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy  Consumer lifestyle public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service  Crisis communication – responding in a crisis  Internal communications – communicating within the company itself  Government relations – engaging government departments to influence public policy  Food centric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods  beverages and wine  Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations  After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field  they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset  especially for those in media relations   Within each discipline  typical activities include publicity events  speaking opportunities  press releases  newsletters  blogs  social media  press kits and outbound communication to members of the press  Video and audio news releases  VNRs and ANRs  are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content   4 1  Audience targeting  A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the target audience and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience  Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages  These messages however should be relevant to each other  thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme  Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems  low visibility  lack of public understanding  opposition from critics and insufficient support from funding sources   On the other hand  stakeholder theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue  All audiences are stakeholders  or presumptive stakeholders   but not all stakeholders are audiences  For example  if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease  the charity and the people with the disease are stakeholders  but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money  Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations  market positioning and branding  They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear  unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them   4 2  Messaging  Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around a product  person  company or service  Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choice or other decisions that have an impact on the company  Brands aim to have the same problem statement  industry viewpoint or brand perception shared across sources and media   4 3  Social media marketing  Digital marketing is the use of Internet tools and technologies such as search engines  Web 2 0 social bookmarking  new media relations  blogging and social media marketing  Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public  customers and prospects  We will continue to witness changes in public relations practices  People wishing to pursue a future with PR will be required to think differently  They will have to adopt new strategies and learn new ways to conduct searches  During the first years of social media  PR had a hard time keeping up with the speed of these new technologies  Breakenridge  2012   PR practitioners have always relied on the media such as TV  Radio  and Magazines to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically for a given audience  Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal but it s also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades  Lister et al  said that  Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place   PR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before  For instance  cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another  They are also used for online shopping  dating  learning and getting the most up to date news around the world   4 4  Other techniques  Litigation public relations is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its impact on the client’s overall reputation  Haggerty  2003    5  Ethics  Public Relations professional both serve the public s interest and private interests of businesses  associations  non profit organizations and governments  This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values  This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations  In 2000  the Public Relations Society of America  PRSA  responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics “advocacy” – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline   The field of public relations is generally highly un regulated  but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations  The Chartered Institute of Public Relations  the Public Relations Society of America and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code  Still  Edelman s 2003 semi annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible  Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices  questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility  They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy making role  On the other hand  marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing   According to Scott Cutlip  the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum  but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate   5 1  Spin  Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit meant to manipulate the public  but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a  polishing of the truth   Today spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion  Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are  Within the field of public relations  spin is seen as a derogatory term  interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation  Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called  spin doctors    In Stuart Ewen’s PR  A Social History of Spin  he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless  Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force  He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages   The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions  cherry picking   the so called  non denial denial   phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths  euphemisms for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful  and ambiguity in public statements  Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news   5 2  Negative  Negative public relations  also called dark public relations  DPR  and in some earlier writing  Black PR   is a process of destroying the target s reputation and or corporate identity  The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else  who may pose a threat to the client s business or be a political rival  DPR may rely on IT security  industrial espionage  social engineering and competitive intelligence  Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target  producing misleading facts to fool a competitor  In politics  a decision to use negative PR is also known as negative campaigning   5 3  Politics and civil society  In Propaganda  1928   Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy  In public relations  lobby groups are created to influence government policy  corporate policy or public opinion  typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization   In fact  Edward Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives  by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses ’ which include our behavior  political and economic spheres or our morals  In theory  each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues  However  in practice  it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence  This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale   When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base  it is known as a front group  Front groups are a form of astroturfing  because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests  They create a fake grass roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public  when they actually serve their sponsors   Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views  policies and even personalities to their best advantages   6  See also  Brand management  Impression management  Media manipulation  Promotion  marketing   Propaganda  Publicist  List of public relations journals  Reputation management
