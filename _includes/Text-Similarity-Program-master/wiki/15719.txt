Economy of Jordan refers to the history of economic development of Jordan  The GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s  declined 30% in the 1980s  and rose 36% in the 1990s  Jordan is classified as an emerging market  After King Abdullah II s accession to the throne in 1999  liberal economic policies were introduced that resulted in a boom that continued through 2009  Jordan has a developed banking sector that attracts investors due to conservative bank policies that enabled the country to weather the global financial crisis of 2009  Jordan s economy has been growing at an annual rate of 7% for a decade  Jordan has FTA s with the United States  Canada  Singapore  Malaysia  the European Union  Tunisia  Algeria  Libya  Turkey and Syria  More FTA s are planned with Iraq  the Palestinian Authority  the GCC  Lebanon  and Pakistan  Jordan is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement  the Euro Mediterranean free trade agreement  the Agadir Agreement  and also enjoys advanced status with the EU   Jordan is an emerging knowledge economy  The main obstacles to Jordan s economy are scarce water supplies  complete reliance on oil imports for energy  and regional instability  Just over 10% of its land is arable and the water supply is limited  Rainfall is low and highly variable  and much of Jordan s available ground water is not renewable  Jordan s economic resource base centers on phosphates  potash  and their fertilizer derivatives  tourism  overseas remittances  and foreign aid  These are its principal sources of hard currency earnings  Lacking coal reserves  hydroelectric power  large tracts of forest or commercially viable oil deposits  Jordan relies on natural gas for 10% of its domestic energy needs  Jordan used to depend on Iraq for oil until the Iraq invasion in 2003 by the United States   Rapid privatization of previously state controlled industries and liberalization of the economy is spurring growth in urban centers like Amman and Aqaba  Jordan has six special economic zones that attract large scale investment  Aqaba  Mafraq  Ma an  Ajloun  the Dead Sea  and Irbid  Jordan also has a plethora of industrial zones producing goods in the textile  aerospace  defense  ICT  pharmaceutical  and cosmetic sectors   1  Exchange Rates  This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Jordan at market prices by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Jordanian Dinars   For purchasing power parity comparisons  the Jordanian Dinar is exchanged per US dollar at 0 359   Jordan s population is 6 342 948 and mean wages were $4 19 per manhour in 2009   2  Economic Overview  Jordan is classified by the World Bank as an  upper middle income country   According to the Heritage Foundation s Index of Economic Freedom  Jordan has the third freest economy in the Middle East and North Africa  behind only Bahrain and Qatar  and the 32nd freest in the world  Jordan ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world  according to the World Economic Forum s Index of Economic Competitiveness  The Kingdom scored higher than many of its peers in the Persian Gulf and Europe like Kuwait  Israel  and Ireland  The 2010 AOF Index of Globalization ranked Jordan as the most globalized country in the Middle East and North Africa region  Jordan s banking sector is classified as  highly developed  by the IMF along with the GCC economies and Lebanon  The official currency in Jordan is the Jordanian dinar and divides into 100 qirsh  also called piastres  or 1000 fils  Since 23 October 1995  the dinar has been officially pegged to the IMF s special drawing rights  SDRs   In practice  it is fixed at 1 US$   0 709 dinar  which translates to approximately 1 dinar   1 41044 dollars  The Central Bank buys US dollars at 0 708 dinar  and sell US dollars at 0 7125 dinar  Exchangers buys US dollars at 0 708 and sell US dollars at 0 709   The Jordanian market is considered one of the most developed Arab market outside the Gulf states  Jordan ranked 18th on the 2012 Global Retail Development Index which lists the 30 most attractive retail markets in the world  Jordan was ranked as the 19th most expensive country in the world to live in 2010 and the most expensive Arab country to live in   Jordan has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 2000  In the 2009 Global Enabling Trade Report  Jordan ranked 4th in the Arab World behind the UAE  Bahrain  and Qatar  The Free Trade Agreement  FTA  with the United States that went into effect in December 2001 will phase out duties on nearly all goods and services by 2010   The proportion of skilled workers in Jordan is among the highest in the region  Many of the world’s major software and hardware IT companies are present in Jordan  The presence of such firms underlines Jordan’s attractiveness as a stable base with high calibre human resources from which to serve the wider region  According to a report published in January 2012 by the founder of venture capital firm Finaventures  Rachid Sefraoui  Amman is one of the top 10 best cities in the world to launch a tech start up   Jordan has high unemployment rates  11 9% in the fourth quarter of 2010 but some estimate it to be as high as a quarter of the working age population  An estimated 13 3% of citizens live under the poverty line  Since the mid 1970s  migrants’ remittances are Jordan’s most important source of foreign exchange  and a decisive factor in the country’s economic development and the rising standard of living of the population   Agriculture in Jordan constituted almost 40% of GNP in the early 1950s  on the eve of the June 1967 War  it was 17%  By the mid 1980s  agriculture s share of GNP in Jordan was only about 6%   Jordan hosts SOFEX  the world s fastest growing and region’s only special operations and homeland security exhibition and conference  Jordan is a regional and international provider of advanced military goods and services  The KADDB Industrial Park  specialized in defense manufacturing  was opened in September 2009 in Mafraq  By 2015  the park is expected to provide around 15 000 job opportunities whereas the investment volume is expected to reach JD500 million  A report by Strategic Foresight Group has calculated the opportunity cost of conflict for the Middle East from 1991 to 2010 at $12 trillion  Jordan s share in this is almost $84 billion   Jordan has a 138% mobile phone penetration rate and a 63% internet penetration rate  41 6% of all mobile phones in Jordan are smartphones  compared with 40% in the United States and 26% in the United Kingdom  97% of Jordanian households own at least one television set while 90% have satellite reception  Furthermore  61% of Jordanian households own at least one personal computer or laptop   According to an investment survey  Jordan ranked as the 9th best outsourcing destination worldwide  Amman is one of the top 10 cities in the world to launch a tech start up in 2012 and is becoming referred to as the  Silicon Valley of the Middle East    Jordan has hosted the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa six times and plans to hold it again at the Dead Sea for the seventh time in 2013  Amman also hosts the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week semiannually and is the only city in the region to hold such a prestigious event that is usually held by the likes of New York  Paris  and Milan   2 1  Standard of living  Jordan is one of the most liberal countries in the Middle East with a secular government  In the 2010 Human Development Index  Jordan was placed in the  high human development  bracket and came 7th among Arab countries  after the Persian Gulf states and Lebanon  The 2010 Quality of Life Index prepared by International Living magazine ranked Jordan second in the MENA with 55 0 points after Israel   Decades of political stability and security and strict law enforcement make Jordan one of the top 10 countries worldwide in security  In the 2010 Newsweek  World s Best Countries  list  Jordan ranked 53rd worldwide  and 3rd among Arab countries after Kuwait and the UAE  Jordan is also among the top ten countries whose citizens feel safest walking the streets at night   As of 2011  63% of working Jordanians are insured with the Social Security Corporation  as well as 120 000 foreigners  with plans to include the rest of Jordanian workers both inside and outside the kingdom as well as students  housewives  business owners  and the unemployed  Only 1 6% of Jordanians make less than $2 a day  one of the lowest in the developing world according to the Human Poverty Index   In the 2010 Gallup Global Wellbeing Survey  30% of Jordanians described their financial situation as  thriving   surpassed most of the Arab countries with the exception of Qatar  the United Arab Emirates  Kuwait  and Saudi Arabia  In 2008  the Jordanian government launched the  Decent Housing for a Decent Living  project aimed at building 120 000 affordable housing units within the next 5 years  plus an additional 100 000 housing units if the need arises   3  Industries  3 1  Agriculture  forestry  and fishing  Despite increases in production  the agriculture sector’s share of the economy has declined steadily to just 2 4 percent of gross domestic product by 2004  About 4 percent of Jordan’s labor force worked in the agricultural sector in 2002  The most profitable segment of Jordan’s agriculture is fruit and vegetable production  including tomatoes  cucumbers  citrus fruit  and bananas  in the Jordan Valley  The rest of crop production  especially cereal production  remains volatile because of the lack of consistent rainfall  Fishing and forestry are negligible in terms of the overall domestic economy  The fishing industry is evenly divided between live capture and aquaculture  the live weight catch totaled just over 1 000 metric tons in 2002  The forestry industry is even smaller in economic terms  approximately 240 000 total cubic meters of roundwood were removed in 2002  the vast majority for fuelwood   3 2  Mining and minerals  Potash and phosphates are among the country’s main economic exports  In 2003 approximately 2 million tons of potash salt production translated into US$192 million in export earnings  making it the second most lucrative exported good  Potash production totaled 1 9 million tons in 2004 and 1 8 million tons in 2005  In 2004 approximately 6 75 million tons of phosphate rock production generated US$135 million in export earnings  placing it fourth on Jordan’s principal export list  With production totaling 6 4 million tons in 2005  Jordan was the world’s third largest producer of raw phosphates  In addition to these two major minerals  smaller quantities of unrefined salt  copper ore  gypsum  manganese ore  and the mineral precursors to the production of ceramics  glass sand  clays  and feldspar  are also mined   3 3  Industry and manufacturing  The industrial sector  which includes mining  manufacturing  construction  and power  accounted for approximately 26 percent of gross domestic product in 2004  including manufacturing  16 2 percent  construction  4 6 percent  and mining  3 1 percent   More than 21 percent of the country’s labor force was reported to be employed in this sector in 2002  The main industrial products are potash  phosphates  pharmaceuticals  cement  clothes  and fertilizers  The most promising segment of this sector is construction  In the past several years  demand has increased rapidly for housing and offices of foreign enterprises based in Jordan to better access the Iraqi market  The manufacturing sector has grown as well  to nearly 20 percent of GDP by 2005   in large part as a result of the United States–Jordan Free Trade Agreement  ratified in 2001 by the U S  Senate   the agreement has led to the establishment of approximately 13 Qualifying Industrial Zones  QIZs  throughout the country  The QIZs  which provide duty free access to the U S  market  produce mostly light industrial products  especially ready made garments  By 2004 the QIZs accounted for nearly US$1 1 billion in exports according to the Jordanian government   Jordan’s free trade agreement  FTA  with the US – the first in the Arab world – has already made the US one of Jordan’s most significant markets  By 2010 it will have barrier free export access in almost all sectors  A number of trade agreements with countries in the Middle Eastern and North African regions and beyond should also reap increasing benefits  not in the least the Agadir Agreement  which is seen as a precursor to an FTA with the EU  Jordan also recently signed an FTA with Canada  Furthermore  Jordan’s plethora of industrial zones offering tax incentives  low utility costs and improved infrastructure links are helping incubate new developments  The relatively high skills level is also a key factor in promoting investment and stimulating the economy  particularly in value added sectors  Despite the fact that Jordan has few natural resources it does benefit from abundant reserves of potash and phosphates  which are widely used in the production of fertilisers  Exports by these industries are expected to have a combined worth of $1bn in 2008  Other important industries include pharmaceuticals  which exported around $435m in 2006 and $260m in the first half of 2008 alone  as well as textiles  which were worth $1 19bn in 2007  Although the value of Jordan’s industrial sector is high  the kingdom faces a number of challenges  Because the country is dependent on importing raw materials  it is vulnerable to price volatility  Shortages in water and power also make consistent development difficult  Despite these challenges  Jordan’s economic openness and long standing fertiliser and pharmaceutical industries should continue to provide a solid source of foreign currency   Jordan has a plethora of industrial zones and special economic zones aimed at increasing exports and making Jordan an industrial giant  The Mafraq SEZ is focused on industry and logistics hoping to become the regional logistics hub with air  road  and rail links to neighboring countries and eventually Europe and the Persian Gulf  The Ma an SEZ is primaril industrial focusing on satisfying domestic demand and reducing reliance on imports  With a national rail system under construction  Jordan expects trade to grow significantly and Jordan will mostly become the trade hub of the Levant and even the Middle East region as a whole due to its geography & natural resources   3 4  Telecoms and IT  Telecommunications is a billion dollar industry with estimates showing that core markets of fixed line  mobile and data service generate annual revenue of around JD836 5m  $1 18bn  per year  which is equivalent to 13 5% of GDP  Jordan s IT sector is the most developed and competitive in the region due to the 2001 telecom liberalization  Market share of the mobile sector  the most competitive telecoms market  is currently fairly evenly divided between the three operators  with Zain  owned by MTC Kuwait  maintaining the largest share  39%   followed by France Telecom’s brand Orange  36%  and Umniah  25%   which is 96% owned by Bahrain’s Batelco  End of year figures for 2007 show that the market trend is towards greater parity  with Zain’s share falling in the space of a year from 47% in 2006 and the other two operators picking up subscribers  The increased competition has led to pricing that is more favourable to consumers  Mobile penetration is currently around 80%  Ambitious subsequent national strategies were formulated already since Y 2000 as a private sector initiative directly led by his majesty the king of Jordan  Information technology association in Jordan  int@j   was established to kick off a private sector process that would focus on preparing Jordan for the new economy through IT and shall reflect the national objectives towards automation and modernization in co operation with the ministry of information technology in Jordan the  MOICT    The latest strategy will take the sector through to 2011  aims to bring Jordan to precise objectives  The ICT sector currently accounts for over a 14%  indirect   of the kingdom’s GDP  This figure includes foreign investment and total domestic revenue from the sector  Employment growth in the sector was progressive and reached up to 60 000  indirect   by 2008  The government is working to address employment issues and education related to sector by developing ICT training and opportunities to increase the overall penetration of ICT in Jordanian society  The policy outlines a number of objectives for the country to reach within the next three years  including almost doubling the size of the sector to $3bn  and pushing internet user penetration up to 50%  The early founder of Int@j and its first chairman of the board is Karim Kuwar and early activists who drove the national strategic objectives and helped formulate an action plan through the developing pillars were Marwan Juma Jordan s minister of ICT  Doha Abdelkhaleq on labour and education  Humam Mufti on advocacy and Nashat Masri on Capital and finance amongst others  Such an infrastructure made Jordan a suitable location for IT startups that operate in the fields of web development  mobile application development  online services  and investment in IT businesses   3 5  Energy  Energy remains perhaps the biggest challenge for continued growth for Jordan’s economy  Spurred by the surge in the price of oil to more than $145 a barrel at its peak  the Jordanian government has responded with an ambitious plan for the sector  The country’s lack of domestic resources is being addressed via a $14bn investment programme in the sector  The programme aims to reduce reliance on imported products from the current level of 96%  with renewables meeting 10% of energy demand by 2020 and nuclear energy meeting 60% of energy needs by 2035  The government also announced in 2007 that it would scale back subsidies in several areas  including energy  where there have historically been regressive subsidies for fuel and electricity  In another new step  the government is opening up the sector to competition  and intends to offer all the planned new energy projects to international tender   Unlike most of its neighbors  Jordan has no significant petroleum resources of its own and is heavily dependent on oil imports to fulfill its domestic energy needs  In 2002 proved oil reserves totaled only   Jordan produced only in 2004 but consumed an estimated   According to U S  government figures  oil imports had reached about in 2004  The Iraq invasion of 2003 disrupted Jordan’s primary oil supply route from its eastern neighbor  which under Saddam Hussein had provided the kingdom with highly discounted crude oil via overland truck routes  Since late 2003  an alternative supply route by tanker through the Al Aqabah port has been established  Saudi Arabia is now Jordan’s primary source of imported oil  Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  UAE  are secondary sources  Although not so heavily discounted as Iraqi crude oil  supplies from Saudi Arabia and the UAE are subsidized to some extent   In the face of continued high oil costs  interest has increased in the possibility of exploiting Jordan s vast oil shale resources  which are estimated to total approximately 40 billion tons  4 billion tons of which are believed to be recoverable  Jordan s oil shale resources could produce of oil  enabling production of about   The oil shale in Jordan has the fourth largest in the world which currently  there are several companies who are negotiating with the Jordanian government about exploiting the oil shale like Royal Dutch Shell  Petrobras and Eesti Energia   Natural gas is increasingly being used to fulfill the country’s domestic energy needs  especially with regard to electricity generation  Jordan was estimated to have only modest natural gas reserves  about 6 billion cubic meters in 2002   but new estimates suggest a much higher total  In 2003 the country produced and consumed an estimated 390 million cubic meters of natural gas  The primary source is located in the eastern portion of the country at the Risha gas field  The country imports the bulk of its natural gas via the recently completed Arab Gas Pipeline that stretches from the Al Arish terminal in Egypt underwater to Al Aqabah and then to northern Jordan  where it links to two major power stations  This Egypt–Jordan pipeline supplies Jordan with approximately 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year   The state owned National Electric Power Company  NEPCO  produces most of Jordan’s electricity  94%   Since mid 2000  privatization efforts have been undertaken to increase independent power generation facilities  a Belgian firm was set to begin operations at a new power plant near Amman with an estimated capacity of 450 megawatts  Power plants at Az Zarqa  400 megawatts  and Al Aqabah  650 MW  are Jordan s other primary electricity providers  As a whole  the country consumed nearly 8 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2003 while producing only 7 5 billion kWh of electricity  Electricity production in 2004 rose to 8 7 billion kWh  but production must continue to increase in order to meet demand  which the government estimates will continue to grow by about 5% per year  About 99 percent of the population is reported to have access to electricity   3 6  Transport  The transportation sector on average contributes some 10% to Jordan’s GDP  with transportation and communications accounting for $2 14bn in 2007  Well aware of the sector’s importance to the country’s service and industry oriented economy  in 2008 the government formulated a new national transport strategy with the aim to improve  modernise and further privatise the sector  With no imminent solution to the ongoing security crisis in Iraq in sight  prospects for the Jordanian transport sector as a whole look bright  The country will arguably remain one of the major transit points for both goods and people destined for Iraq  while the number of tourists visiting Jordan is set to continue to increase  The main events to follow in the near future are the relocation of Aqaba’s main port  a national railway system  and the construction of a new terminal at QAIA  Volatility in fuel prices is almost certainly going to have negative effects on operational costs and as such may hamper the sector’s average annual growth of around 6%  However  uncertain fuel prices also offer a great deal of incentive to boost private investments in alternative modes of transport such as public buses and improved trains   3 7  Media and Advertising  Although the state remains a major influence  Jordan’s media sector has seen significant privatisation and liberalisation efforts in recent years  Based on official rack rates  research firm Ipsos estimated that the advertisement sector spent some $280m towards publicity in Jordan’s media  80% of which was spent on newspapers  followed by TV  radio and magazines  The biggest event of 2007 was the cancelled launch of ATV  the kingdom’s first private broadcaster  As a result  the state owned Jordan TV  JTV  remains the country’s sole broadcaster  In recent years  Jordan has also seen a spectacular rise in the number of blogs  websites and news portals as sources of news information  The increasing diversification of Jordan’s media is a good sign and should boost advertising revenues and private initiatives   Recording growth of 30%  2007 turned out to be yet another outstanding year for Jordan’s advertising industry  Following nearly a decade of double digit growth  however  most publicity specialists expect to see a relative slowdown in 2008  Unlike 2007  no major campaigns were planned for the first part of 2008  Additionally  the Jordanian advertising had some catching up to do with the rest of the region in terms of average expenditure per capita  As the sector matures  it is only normal for growth figures to gradually decrease  Since 2000 total ad spend increased from $77m to $280m in 2007  an increase of 260%  The Jordanian telecoms sector was the biggest ad spender in 2007  accounting for around 20% of the market  followed by banking and finance sector  12%   services industry  11%   real estate  8%  and the automotive sector  5%   In the next year  particularly if there is a downturn  it will become increasingly important for the sector to develop good vocational training and to begin to take advantage of new media markets   3 8  Services  Services accounted for more than 70 percent of gross domestic product  GDP  in 2004  The sector employed nearly 75 percent of the labor force in 2002  The banking sector is widely regarded as advanced by both regional and international terms  In 2007  total profits of the 15 listed banks rose 14 89% to JD640m  $909m   Jordan’s strong growth of 6% in 2007 was reflected in a 20 57% expansion in net credit to JD17 9bn  $25 4bn  by the end of the year  Most improvement was in trade  construction and industry  Many banks suffered from the sharp correction in the Amman Stock Market in 2006  encouraging them to focus on core banking business in 2007  and this was reflected in a 16 65% rise in net interest and commission income to JD1 32bn  $1 87bn   The stock market also picked up in 2007 and total portfolio income losses decreased  Although Jordan’s banking sector is small by global standards  it has attracted strong interest from regional investors in Lebanon and the GCC  New regulations introduced by the CBJ  in addition to political stability  have helped to create a favourable investment environment  Its conservative policies helped Jordan avoid the global financial crisis of 2009  Jordanian banks was one of the only countries that posted a profit in 2009   Contributing an estimated JD477 5m  $678 05m   or 4 25% of Jordan’s GDP  according to figures from the Central Bank  the construction sector performed strongly in 2007  The Great Amman Municipality  GAM  completed its master plan for the capital  which is expected to grow from 700 km2 today to 1700 km2 by 2025  Amman is changing from a predominantly horizontal to a largely vertical city due to various clusters of high rises  Significant developments outside Amman include the rapid residential build up of Zarqa  the transformation of Aqaba into a commercial and tourist centre  and the construction of a series of high end hotels and tourist resorts along the Dead Sea  A new airport terminal  Amman ring road and a light rail between the capital and Zarqa are being constructed   Despite recording a relative slowdown compared to the expansion of recent years  Jordan’s construction and real estate market continued to grow in 2007  Trading totaled JD5 6bn  $8bn   up from JD5 2bn  $7 4bn  in 2006  according to Jordan’s Land and Survey Department  Although the years of astounding growth—some 75% in 2004 and 48% in 2005—seem to have passed  the future looks bright for real estate  as demand continues to outstrip supply  while Jordan remains a very attractive investment destination for foreign businesses  second home buyers and Jordanians working abroad  With Jordan’s continuing sharp population growth  as well as its strategic location at the heart of the Middle East  the kingdom’s main market drivers indicate a bright future for years to come  Although a number of class A office space developments are currently under construction  it will take a few years to close the gap between demand and supply  The Amman retail market may become more saturated in the short term  Consequently  developers may turn to other cities to build supermarkets and malls   Jordan’s insurance market  with 29 companies operating in a country of just 5 7m people  is saturated  despite regulatory encouragements for mergers and acquisitions  In terms of market share based on premiums  motor coverage accounts for 42 4%  medical insurance 18 6%  fire and property damage 17%  life 9 8%  marine and transport 7 9% and other insurance the remaining 4 3%  The insurance sector made up 2 52% of GDP in 2006  up from 2 43% in 2005  Current plans call for increasing the sector’s GDP contribution to 7% in the short term and 10% in the long term  The sector holds great potential but remains underdeveloped  Region wide price increases and a lack of consumer understanding of products are two major challenges  In addition  cultural considerations  including religion  make improving market penetration difficult  The cost of living has also risen  and the IMF forecasts that the inflation rate will reach 9% in 2008  Salaries have remained unchanged  however  leaving consumers with less disposable income  Other than mandatory motor coverage  insurance products are considered a luxury by average Jordanians  who must often prioritise spending  There will likely only be a few changes to the market in the coming year  Members of the sector would like to see greater coordination among the regulators and those working for the kingdom’s legal system in order to improve insurance laws   3 9  Tourism  The state of the tourism sector is widely regarded as below potential  especially given the country’s rich history  ancient ruins  Mediterranean climate  and diverse geography  Despite personal appeals by the king and an increasingly sophisticated marketing campaign  the industry is still adversely affected by the political instability of the region  More than 5 million visitors entered Jordan in 2004  generating US$1 3 billion in earnings  Earnings from tourism rose to US$1 4 billion in 2005  The fact that the bulk of Jordan’s tourist trade emanates from elsewhere in the Middle East should contribute to the industry’s growth potential in the years ahead  as Jordan is relatively stable  open  and safe in comparison to many of its neighbors  The tourism sector remains an important element of the Jordanian economy  directly employing some 30 000 Jordanians and contributing 10% to the kingdom’s GDP  Despite a decline in Arab and Gulf visitors  2007 marked a year of steady growth for the tourism sector  Revenues jumped 13% to nearly $2 11bn during the first 11 months  up from $1 86bn for the same period in 2006  The sector is overseen by the government’s National Tourism Strategy  NTS   which was established in 2004 to take the industry through 2010  NTS aimed to double tourism revenues during the period and to increase tourism related jobs to 91 719  The first goal has already been met but the second one might be more of a challenge  between 2004 and 2007 the total number of people employed in the sector rose from 23 544 to 35 484  This is impressive growth  but less than half the 90 000 or more goal  NTS hopes to place Jordan as a boutique destination for high end tourists  The strategy identifies seven priorities or niche markets  cultural heritage  archaeology   religious  ecotourism  health and wellness  adventure  meetings  incentives  conventions and exhibitions  MICE   and cruises  The Jordan Tourism Board’s  JTB  marketing budget has increased in the past year from JD6m  $8 52m  to JD11 5m  $16 3m   These are positive times for tourism in Jordan  with steady growth and major projects in the pipeline  The sector has to make improvements of infrastructure and marketing  but overall the industry has been improving for the past several years   4  External trade  Since 1995  economic growth has been low  Real GDP has grown at only about 1 5% annually  while the official unemployment has hovered at 14%  unofficial estimates are double this number   The budget deficit and public debt have remained high and continue to widen  yet during this period inflation has remained low due mainly to stable monetary policy and the continued peg to the United States Dollar  Exports of manufactured goods have risen at an annual rate of 9%  Monetary stability has been reinforced  even when tensions were renewed in the region during 1998  and during the illness and ultimate death of King Hussein in 1999   Expectations of increased trade and tourism as a consequence of Jordan s peace treaty with Israel have been disappointing  Security related restrictions to trade with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have led to a substantial decline in Jordan s exports there  Following his ascension  King Abdullah improved relations with Arabic states of the Persian Gulf and Syria  but this brought few real economic benefits  Most recently the Jordanians have focused on WTO membership and a Free Trade Agreement with the U S  as means to encourage export led growth   5  Investment  The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Jordan was valued at $37 639 billion in 2005 by the World Bank   6  Salaries  According to the 2010 Middle East Salary Survey conducted by Bayt com  Jordanians earn more than their counterparts in other Arab countries with the exception of the oil rich Gulf  27% of Jordanian workers earn less than $6000 annually  28% earn between $6000 and $12 000 annually  21% earn between $12 000 and $24 000 annually  10% earn between $24 000 and $36 000 annually  6% earn between $36 000 and $60 000 annually  2% earn between $60 000 and $96 000 annually  2% earn more than $96 000 annually   Around 97 percent of Jordanians have more than one source of income  according to the Department of Statistics   7  Aqaba  Though a town of only 100 000 people  Aqaba is setting an example of how to attract investment  In a decade  domestic and foreign investment into the Aqaba region has increased dramatically and the town’s population is set to double over the next 10 years  Certainly  the town benefits from some natural advantages  Located at the southern tip of the country  between Saudi Arabia and Israel on the shores of the Red Sea  the city is close to the Suez Canal  with easy access to key trade centres in both the Middle East and Africa  Aqaba is also the kingdom’s only deep water port town  taking up most of Jordan’s scant of coastline  The Aqaba Special Economic Zone  ASEZ  has been responsible
