The economy of Montserrat was severely disrupted by volcanic activity which began in July 1995  Prior to this date  the small island country of 12 000 had an export economy based on agriculture  clothing  electronic parts and plants  with a per capita gross national product of USD 3 000 to 8 000  It had an international reputation as a tourist getaway  and the record producer George Martin established an important recording studio there  Associated Independent Recording  Destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989  the studio was never reestablished  however Martin subsequently helped found the Montserrat Cultural Centre  which was opened in 2007  Some of the funds were raised in a London concert called  Music for Montserrat   September 15  1997    1  Collapse  A catastrophic eruption of Soufrière Hills in June 1997 closed the W  H  Bramble Airport and seaport at Plymouth  causing further economic and social dislocation  Two thirds of the inhabitants fled the island  Some began to return in 1998  but lack of housing limited the number   The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops  Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the volcano and on public sector construction activity  The UK launched a three year $122 8 million aid program to help reconstruct the economy  Half of the island was expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade   Today  Montserrat’s main economic activity is in construction and government services which together accounted for about 50 percent of GDP in 2000 when it was EC$76 million  In contrast  banking and insurance together accounted for less than 10 percent of GDP  The unemployment rate in 1998 was estimated at 6 percent  Montserrat’s domestic financial sector is very small and has seen a reduction in offshore finance in recent years with only 11 offshore banks remaining  Real GDP declined from EC$122 million in 1995 to about EC$60 million in 1999  with the rate of decline peaking at  21 5 percent for 1996  The decline in economic activity reflected in large part the completion of major projects in both the private and public sectors  However  the rate of decline slowed markedly since 2000 and 2001  when GDP contracted by less than 3 percent  In 2002  the GDP growth rate reverted to a positive 4 6 percent reversing the declining trend over the past six years and maybe more   2  New Town  The Montserrat Development Corporation  responsible for fostering private sector investment and development  has announced plans to develop the new town of Little Bay on the northwest coast of Montserrat between Brades and Davy Hill  Slated for completion by 2020  the site will be the new focus of tourism  trade and housing and will also house the seat of government   3  References
