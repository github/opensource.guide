In Greek mythology  Lethe  Greek    Lḗthē      was one of the five rivers of Hades  Also known as the Ameles potamos  river of unmindfulness   the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld  where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness  Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion  with whom the river was often identified   In Classical Greek  the word lethe literally means  oblivion    forgetfulness   or  concealment   It is related to the Greek word for  truth   aletheia  ἀλήθεια   which through the privative alpha literally means  un forgetfulness  or  un concealment    1  Mythology  1 1  River  Lethe  the river of forgetfulness  was one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld  the other four being Styx  the river of hate   Acheron  the river of sorrow   Cocytus  the river of lamentation  and Phlegethon  the river of fire   According to Statius  it bordered Elysium  the final resting place of the virtuous  Ovid wrote that the river flowed through the cave of Hypnos  god of sleep  where its murmuring would induce drowsiness   The shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe in order to forget their earthly life  In the Aeneid  Virgil writes that it is only when the dead have had their memories erased by the Lethe that they may be reincarnated   1 2  Goddess  Lethe was also the name of the personification of forgetfulness and oblivion  with whom the river was often associated  Hesiod s Theogony identifies her as the daughter of Eris   strife    and the sister of Ponos   pain    Limos   starvation    the Algea   pains    the Hysminai   fightings    the Makhai   battles    the Phonoi   murders    the Androktasiai   man slaughters    the Neikea   quarrels    the Pseudologoi   lies    the Amphilogiai   disputes    Dysnomia   lawlessness    Atë   ruin    and Horkos   oath     2  Role in religion and philosophy  Some ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river before being reincarnated  so they would not remember their past lives  The Myth of Er at the end of Plato s Republic tells of the dead arriving at the  plain of Lethe   through which the river Ameles   careless   runs  A few mystery religions taught the existence of another river  the Mnemosyne  those who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain omniscience  Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from after death  and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe  These two rivers are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th century BC and onward  found at Thurii in Southern Italy and elsewhere throughout the Greek world  There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the oracular shrine of Trophonius in Boeotia  from which worshippers would drink before making oracular consultations with the god  More recently  Martin Heidegger used  lēthē  to symbolize the  concealment of Being  or  forgetting of Being  that he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy  Examples are found in his books on Nietzsche  Vol 1  p  194  and on Parmenides   3  Real rivers  Amongst authors in Antiquity  the tiny Limia River between Northern Portugal and Galicia  Spain  was said to have the same properties of memory loss as the legendary Lethe River  being mistaken by it  In 138 BC  the Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus sought to dispose of the myth  as it impeded his military campaigns in the area  He was said to have crossed the Limia and then called his soldiers on the other side  one by one  by name  The soldiers  astonished that their general remembered their names  crossed the river as well without fear  This act proved that the Limia was not as dangerous as the local myths described   In Cadiz  Spain   the river Guadalete was originally named Lethe by local Greek and Phoenician colonists who  about to go to war  solved instead their differences by diplomacy and named the river Lethe to forever forget their former differences  When the Arabs conquered the region much later  their name for the river became Guadalete  River Lethe  in Arabic    In Alaska  a river which runs through the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is called River Lethe   4  See also  Oblivion  eternal   River Lethe in popular culture  The Golden Bough  mythology   5  References  6  External links
