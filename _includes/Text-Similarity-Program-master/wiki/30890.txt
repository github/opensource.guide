A time zone is a region that has a uniform standard time for legal  commercial  and social purposes  It is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time  so time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions   Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time  UTC  by a whole number of hours  UTC−12 to UTC+14   but a few are offset by 30 or 45 minutes  for example Newfoundland Standard Time is UTC  03 30 and Nepal Standard Time is UTC +05 45   Some higher latitude countries use daylight saving time for part of the year  typically by changing clocks by an hour  Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones  This also creates a permanent daylight saving time effect   1  History  1 1  Early timekeeping  Before clocks were invented  people marked the time of day with apparent solar time  also called  true  solar time  – for example  the time on a sundial – which was typically different for every settlement   When well regulated mechanical clocks became widespread in the early 19th century  each city began to use some local mean solar time  Apparent and mean solar time can differ by up to around 15 minutes  as described by the equation of time  due to the non circular shape of the Earth s orbit around the sun  Eccentricity  and the tilt of the Earth s axis  Obliquity   Mean solar time has days of equal length  and the difference between the two averages to zero after a year   Greenwich Mean Time  GMT  was established in 1675 when the Royal Observatory was built as an aid to mariners to determine longitude at sea  providing a standard reference time when each city in England kept a different local time   1 2  Railroad time  Local solar time became increasingly awkward as rail transport and telecommunications improved  because clocks differed between places by an amount corresponding to the difference in their geographical longitude  which varied by four minutes for every degree of longitude  The difference between New York and Boston is about two degrees or 8 minutes  the difference between Sydney and Melbourne  Australia  is about 7 degrees or 28 minutes  Bristol is 2°35′ W est  of Greenwich  East London   so when it is noon in Bristol  it is about 10 minutes past noon in London  The use of time zones smooths out these differences   The first adoption of a standard time was on December 1  1847  in Great Britain by railway companies using GMT kept by portable chronometers  The first of these companies to adopt standard time was the Great Western Railway  GWR  in November 1840  This quickly became known as Railway Time  About   time signals were first transmitted by telegraph from the Royal Observatory  Greenwich  Even though 98% of Great Britain s public clocks were using GMT by 1855  it was not made Britain s legal time until   Some old British clocks from this period have two minute hands—one for the local time  one for GMT   The increase in worldwide communication had further increased the need for interacting parties to communicate mutually comprehensible time references to one another  The problem of differing local times could be solved across larger areas by synchronizing clocks worldwide  but in many places the local time would then differ markedly from the solar time to which people were accustomed   On November 2  1868  the then British colony of New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed throughout the colony  and was perhaps the first country to do so  It was based on the longitude East of Greenwich  that is 11 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT  This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time   Timekeeping on the American railroads in the mid 19th century was somewhat confused  Each railroad used its own standard time  usually based on the local time of its headquarters or most important terminus  and the railroad s train schedules were published using its own time  Some junctions served by several railroads had a clock for each railroad  each showing a different time   Charles F  Dowd proposed a system of one hour standard time zones for American railroads about 1863  although he published nothing on the matter at that time and did not consult railroad officials until 1869  In 1870 he proposed four ideal time zones  having north–south borders   the first centered on Washington  D C   but by 1872 the first was centered 75°W of Greenwich  with geographic borders  for example  sections of the Appalachian Mountains   Dowd s system was never accepted by American railroads  Instead  U S  and Canadian railroads implemented a version proposed by William F  Allen  the editor of the Traveler s Official Railway Guide  The borders of its time zones ran through railroad stations  often in major cities  For example  the border between its Eastern and Central time zones ran through Detroit  Buffalo  Pittsburgh  Atlanta  and Charleston  It was inaugurated on Sunday    also called  The Day of Two Noons   when each railroad station clock was reset as standard time noon was reached within each time zone  The zones were named Intercolonial  Eastern  Central  Mountain  and Pacific  Within a year 85% of all cities with populations over 10 000  about 200 cities  were using standard time  A notable exception was Detroit  which is about half way between the meridians of eastern time and central time   which kept local time until 1900  then tried Central Standard Time  local mean time  and Eastern Standard Time before a May 1915 ordinance settled on EST and was ratified by popular vote in August 1916  The confusion of times came to an end when Standard zone time was formally adopted by the U S  Congress in the Standard Time Act of March 19  1918   1 3  Worldwide time zones  Although the first person to propose a worldwide system of time zones was Italian mathematician Quirico Filopanti in his book Miranda  published in 1858  his idea was unknown outside the pages of his book until long after his death  so it did not influence the adoption of time zones during the 19th century  He proposed 24 hourly time zones  which he called  longitudinal days   the first centered on the meridian of Rome  He also proposed a universal time to be used in astronomy and telegraphy   Scottish born Canadian Sir Sandford Fleming proposed a worldwide system of time zones in 1879  He advocated his system at several international conferences  thus is widely credited with their invention  In 1876  his first proposal was for a global 24 hour clock  conceptually located at the center of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian  In 1879 he specified that his universal day would begin at the anti meridian of Greenwich  180th meridian   while conceding that hourly time zones might have some limited local use  He also proposed his system at the International Meridian Conference in October 1884  but it did not adopt his time zones because they were not within its purview  The conference did adopt a universal day of 24 hours beginning at Greenwich midnight  but specified that it  shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable    By about 1900  almost all time on Earth was in the form of standard time zones  only some of which used an hourly offset from GMT  Many applied the time at a local astronomical observatory to an entire country  without any reference to GMT  It took many decades before all time on Earth was in the form of time zones referred to some  standard offset  from GMT UTC  By 1929  most major countries had adopted hourly time zones  Nepal was the last country to adopt a standard offset  shifting slightly to UTC+5 45 in 1986   Today  all nations use standard time zones for secular purposes  but they do not all apply the concept as originally conceived  Newfoundland  India  Iran  Afghanistan  Venezuela  Burma  Sri Lanka  the Marquesas  as well as parts of Australia use half hour deviations from standard time  and some nations  such as Nepal  and some provinces  such as the Chatham Islands  use quarter hour deviations  Some countries  most notably China and India  use a single time zone  even though the extent of their territory far exceeds 15° of longitude  Before 1949  China used five time zones   2  Definition  Until 1972 all time zones were specified as an offset from Greenwich Mean Time  GMT   which was the mean solar time at the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich  London  Since 1972 all official time services have broadcast radio time signals synchronized to UTC  a form of atomic time that includes leap seconds to keep it within 0 9 seconds of this former GMT  now called UT1  Many countries now legally define their standard time relative to UTC  although some still legally refer to GMT  including the United Kingdom itself  UTC  also called Zulu time  is used everywhere on Earth by astronomers and others who need to state the time of an event unambiguously   Time zones are based on Greenwich Mean Time  GMT   the mean solar time at longitude 0°  the Prime Meridian   As the rate of rotation of the Earth is not constant  the time derived from atomic clocks is adjusted to stay within a second of UT1  In January 1972 the length of the second in both Greenwich Mean Time and atomic time was equalized  The readings of atomic clocks are averaged to give a uniform time scale   Because the length of the average day is currently 0 002 second more than 24 hours  leap seconds are periodically inserted into Greenwich Mean Time to make it approximate to UT1  This new time system is also called Coordinated Universal Time  UTC   Leap seconds are inserted to keep UTC within 0 9 seconds of UT1  Because the Earth s rotation is gradually slowing  leap seconds will need to be added more frequently in the future  However  from one year to the next the rotation rate is slightly irregular  so leap seconds are not added unless observations of Earth s rotation show that one is needed  In this way  local times will continue to stay close to mean solar time and the effects of variations in Earth s rotation rate will be confined to simple step changes relative to the uniform time scale  International Atomic Time or TAI   All local times differ from TAI by an integral number of seconds  With the implementation of UTC  nations began to use it in the definition of their time zones  As of 2005  most nations had altered the definition of local time in this way   In the United Kingdom  this involved redefining Greenwich Mean Time to make it the same as UTC  British Summer Time  BST  is still one hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time and is therefore also one hour in advance of Coordinated Universal Time  Thus Greenwich Mean Time is the local time at the Royal Observatory  Greenwich between 01 00 GMT on the last Sunday in October and 01 00 GMT on the last Sunday in March  Similar circumstances apply in many other places   Leap seconds are considered by many to be a nuisance   and ways to abolish them are being considered  This means letting the time difference accumulate  One suggestion is to insert a  leap hour  in about 5 000 years   3  Notation of time  3 1  ISO 8601  3 2  UTC  If the time is in Coordinated Universal Time  UTC   add a  Z  directly after the time without a space   Z  is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset   09 30 UTC  is therefore represented as  09 30Z  or  0930Z    14 45 15 UTC  would be  14 45 15Z  or  144515Z    UTC time is also known as  Zulu  time  since  Zulu  is the ICAO spelling alphabet code word for  Z    3 2 1  Offsets from UTC  Offsets from UTC are written in the format ± hh   mm   ± hh  mm   or ± hh   either hour s  ahead or behind UTC   So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC  such as the time in Berlin during the winter   the zone designator would be  +01 00    +0100   or simply  +01   This is appended to the time in the same way that  Z  was above  The offset from UTC changes with daylight saving time  e g  a time offset in Chicago  which is in the North American Central Time Zone  would be  −06 00  for the winter  Central Standard Time  and  −05 00  for the summer   3 3  Abbreviations  Time zones are often represented by abbreviations such as  EST  WST  CST  but these are not part of the international time and date standard ISO 8601 and their use as sole designator for a time zone is not recommended  Such designations can be ambiguous  For example   ECT   could be interpreted as  Eastern Caribbean Time   UTC−4h    Ecuador Time   UTC−5h  or  European Central Time   UTC+1h    4  UTC offsets worldwide  5  List of UTC offsets  These examples give the local time at various locations around the world when daylight saving time is not in effect   Where the adjustment for time zones results in a time at the other side of midnight from UTC  then the date at the location is one day later or earlier   Some examples when UTC is 23 00 on Monday when or where daylight saving time is not in effect   Cairo  Egypt  UTC+02  01 00 on Tuesday  Wellington  New Zealand  UTC+12  11 00 on Tuesday Some examples when UTC is 02 00 on Tuesday when or where daylight saving time is not in effect   Honolulu  Hawaii  United States  UTC−10  16 00 on Monday  Toronto  Ontario  Canada  UTC−05  21 00 on Monday The time zone adjustment for a specific location may vary because of daylight saving time  For example New Zealand  which is usually UTC+12  observes a one hour daylight saving time adjustment during the Southern Hemisphere summer  resulting in a local time of UTC+13   6  Time zone conversions  Conversion between time zones obeys the relationship  in which each side of the equation is equivalent to UTC   The more familiar term  UTC offset  is used here rather than the term  zone designator  used by the standard    The conversion equation can be rearranged to  For example  what time is it in Los Angeles  PST  UTC offset  −08  when the New York Stock Exchange opens at 09 30  EST  −05    In Delhi  IST  UTC offset  +5 30   the New York Stock Exchange opens at  These calculations become more complicated near a daylight saving boundary  because the UTC offset for zone X is a function of the UTC time    The table  Time of day by zone  gives an overview on the time relations between different zones   7  Nautical time zones  Since the 1920s a nautical standard time system has been in operation for ships on the high seas  Nautical time zones are an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system  Under the system  a time change of one hour is required for each change of longitude by 15°  The 15° gore that is offset from GMT or UT1  not UTC  by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7 5° gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours  A nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps  It follows the 180th meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land  forming gaps  it is a pole to pole dashed line   A ship within the territorial waters of any nation would use that nation s standard time  but would revert to nautical standard time upon leaving its territorial waters  The captain is permitted to change the ship s clocks at a time of the captain s choice following the ship s entry into another time zone  The captain often chooses midnight  Ships going in shuttle traffic over a time zone border often keep the same time zone all the time  to avoid confusion about work  meal  and shop opening hours  Still the time table for port calls must follow the land time zone   8  Skewing of zones  Ideal time zones  such as nautical time zones  are based on the mean solar time of a particular meridian located in the middle of that zone with boundaries located 7 5 degrees east and west of the meridian  In practice  zone boundaries are often drawn much farther to the west with often irregular boundaries  and some locations base their time on meridians located far to the east   For example  even though the Prime Meridian  0°  passes through Spain and France  they use the mean solar time of 15 degrees east  Central European Time  rather than 0 degrees  Greenwich Mean Time   France previously used GMT  but was switched to CET  Central European Time  during the German occupation of the country during World War II and did not switch back after the war  Similarly  prior to World War II  the Netherlands observed  Amsterdam Time   which was twenty minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time  They were obliged to follow German time during the war  and kept it thereafter  In the mid 1970s the Netherlands  as with other European states  began observing daylight saving  summer  time   There is a tendency to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their meridians  The main reason for this is that similar working day schedules around the world have led to people rising on average at 07 00 clock time and going to bed at 23 00 clock time  This means that the middle of the period that people are awake   awake time noon   occurs at 15 00     7 + 23  2  clock time  whereas   if using as clock time the time of the nautical time zone to which the location concerned geographically belongs   solar noon occurs at 12 00  +   30 min  clock time  To make solar noon coincide more with awake time noon  i e  make the sun reach its highest point closer to 15 00 clock time rather than 12 00 clock time   the time of one or even two nautical time zones to the east is chosen  Many of these locations also use DST  adding yet another nautical time zone to the east  As a result  in summer  solar noon in the Spanish town of Muxía occurs at 14 37 clock time  indeed very close to awake time noon  15 00   This western most area of continental Spain never experiences sunset before 18 00 clock time  even in midwinter  despite its lying more than 40 degrees north of the equator  Near the summer solstice  Muxia has sunset times  after 22 00  similar to those of Stockholm  which is in the same time zone and 16 degrees further north  Stockholm has much earlier sunrises  though   A more extreme example is Nome  Alaska  which is at 165°24′W longitude—just west of center of the idealized Samoa Time Zone  165°W   Nevertheless  Nome observes Alaska Time  135°W  with DST so it is slightly more than two hours ahead of the sun in winter and over three in summer  Kotzebue  Alaska  also near the same meridian but north of the Arctic Circle  has an annual event on 9 August to celebrate two sunsets in the same 24 hour day  one shortly after midnight at the start of the day  and the other shortly before midnight at the end of the day   Also  China extends as far west as 73°34′E  but all parts of it use UTC+08 00  120°E   so solar  noon  can occur as late as 15 00 in western portions of China such as Xinjiang and Tibet   9  Daylight saving time  Many countries  and sometimes just certain regions of countries  adopt daylight saving time  also known as  Summer Time   during part of the year  This typically involves advancing clocks by an hour near the start of spring and adjusting back in autumn   spring  forward   fall  back   Modern DST was first proposed in 1907 and was in widespread use in 1916 as a wartime measure aimed at conserving coal  Despite controversy  many countries have used it off and on since then  details vary by location and change occasionally  Most countries around the equator do not observe daylight saving time  since the seasonal difference in sunlight is minimal   10  Computer systems and the Internet  Computer operating systems include the necessary support for working with all  or almost all  possible local times based on the various time zones  Internally  operating systems typically use UTC as their basic time keeping standard  while providing services for converting local times to and from UTC  and also the ability to automatically change local time conversions at the start and end of daylight saving time in the various time zones   See the article on daylight saving time for more details on this aspect    Web servers presenting web pages primarily for an audience in a single time zone or a limited range of time zones typically show times as a local time  perhaps with UTC time in brackets  More internationally oriented websites may show times in UTC only or using an arbitrary time zone  For example the international English language version of CNN includes GMT and Hong Kong Time  whereas the US version shows Eastern Time  US Eastern Time and Pacific Time are also used fairly commonly on many US based English language websites with global readership  The format is typically based in the W3C Note  datetime    Email systems and other messaging systems  IRC chat  etc   time stamp messages using UTC  or else include the sender s time zone as part of the message  allowing the receiving program to display the message s date and time of sending in the recipient s local time   Database records that include a time stamp typically use UTC  especially when the database is part of a system that spans multiple time zones  The use of local time for time stamping records is not recommended for time zones that implement daylight saving time due to the fact that once a year there is a one hour period when local times are ambiguous   10 1  Operating systems  10 1 1  Unix  Most Unix like systems  including Linux and Mac OS X  keep system time as UTC  Coordinated Universal Time   Rather than having a single time zone set for the whole computer  timezone offsets can vary for different processes  Standard library routines are used to calculate the local time based on the current timezone  normally supplied to processes through the TZ environment variable  This allows users in multiple timezones to use the same computer  with their respective local times displayed correctly to each user  Time zone information most commonly comes from the IANA time zone database  In fact  many systems  including anything using the GNU C Library  can make use of this database   10 1 2  Microsoft Windows  Windows based computer systems prior to Windows 2000 used local time  but Windows 2000 and later can use UTC as the basic system time  The system registry contains time zone information that includes the offset from UTC and rules that indicate the start and end dates for daylight saving in each zone  Interaction with the user normally uses local time  and application software is able to calculate the time in various zones  Terminal Servers allow remote computers to redirect their time zone settings to the Terminal Server so that users see the correct time for their time zone in their desktop application sessions  Terminal Services uses the server base time on the Terminal Server and the client time zone information to calculate the time in the session   10 2  Programming languages  10 2 1  Java  While most application software will use the underlying operating system for timezone information  the Java Platform  from version 1 3 1  has maintained its own timezone database  This database is updated whenever timezone rules change  Oracle provides an updater tool for this purpose   As an alternative to the timezone information bundled with the Java Platform  programmers may choose to use the Joda Time library  This library includes its own timezone data based on the IANA time zone database   10 2 2  JavaScript  There is very little in the way of timezone support for JavaScript  Essentially the programmer has to extract the UTC offset by instantiating a time object  getting a GMT time from it  and differencing the two  This does not provide a solution for daylight saving variations   10 2 3  Perl  The DateTime object supports all time zones in the Olson DB and includes the ability to get  set and convert between time zones   10 2 4  PHP  The DateTime objects and related functions have been compiled into the PHP core since 5 2  This includes the ability to get and set the default script timezone  and DateTime is aware of its own timezone internally  PHP net provides extensive documentation on this  As noted there  the most current timezone database can be implemented via the PECL timezonedb   10 2 5  Python  The standard module datetime stores and operates on the timezone information class tzinfo  The third party pytz module provides access to the full IANA time zone database  Negated time zone offset in seconds is stored time timezone and time altzone attributes   10 2 6  Smalltalk  Each Smalltalk dialect comes with its own built in classes for dates  times and timestamps  only a few of which implement the DateAndTime and Duration classes as specified by the ANSI Smalltalk Standard  VisualWorks provides a TimeZone class that supports up to two annually recurring offset transitions  which are assumed to apply to all years  same behavior as Windows time zones   Squeak provides a Timezone class that does not support any offset transitions  Dolphin Smalltalk does not support time zones at all   For full support of the tz database  zoneinfo  in a Smalltalk application  including support for any number of annually recurring offset transitions  and support for different intra year offset transition rules in different years  the third party  open source  ANSI Smalltalk compliant Chronos Date Time Library is available for use with any of the following Smalltalk dialects  VisualWorks  Squeak  Gemstone  or Dolphin   10 3  Databases  Some databases allow storage of a datetime type having time zone information  The SQL standard defines two standard time data types     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE   TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE  However  the standard has a somewhat naive understanding of time zones  It generally assumes a time zone can be specified by a simple offset from GMT  This causes problems when trying to do arithmetic on dates which span daylight saving time transitions or which span political changes in time zone rules   10 3 1  Oracle  Oracle Database is configured with a database time zone  and connecting clients are configured with session time zones  Oracle Database uses two data types to store time zone information    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE   Stores date and time information with the offset from UTC   TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE   Stores date and time information with respect to the dbtimezone  which cannot be changed so long as there is a column in the db of this type   automatically adjusting the date and time from the stored time zone to the client s session time zone   10 3 2  PostgreSQL  PostgreSQL uses the standard SQL data types but tries to impose an interpretation which avoids the problems described above     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE   Stores date and time in UTC and converts to the client s local time zone  which could be different for each client  for display purposes and conversion to other types     TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE   Stores date and time without any conversion on input or output  When converting to a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE  interprets it according to the client s local time zone     TIME WITH TIME ZONE   Stores time of day together with a UTC offset in which it is to be interpreted     TIME WITHOUT TIME ZONE   Stores time of day without any time zone specification   11  Time zones in outer space  Orbiting spacecraft typically experience many sunrises and sunsets in a 24 hour period  or in the case of Apollo program astronauts travelling to the moon  none  Thus it is not possible to calibrate time zones with respect to the sun  and still respect a 24 hour sleep wake cycle  A common practice for space exploration is to use the Earth based time zone of the launch site or mission control  This keeps the sleeping cycles of the crew and controllers in sync  The International Space Station normally uses Coordinated Universal Time  UTC    Timekeeping on Mars can be more complex  since the planet has a solar day of approximately 24 hours and 39 minutes  known as a sol  Earth controllers for some Mars missions have synchronized their sleep wake cycles with the Martian day  because solar powered rover activity on the surface was tied to periods of light and dark  The difference in day length caused the sleep wake cycles to slowly drift with respect to the day night cycles on Earth  repeating approximately once every 36 days   12  See also  Daylight
