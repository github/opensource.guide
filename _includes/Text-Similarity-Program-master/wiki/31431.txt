The Book of the City of Ladies  finished by 1405   or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames  is perhaps Christine de Pizan s most famous literary work  and it is her second work of lengthy prose  Pizan uses the vernacular French language to compose the book  but she often uses Latin style syntax and conventions within her French prose  The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun s popular The Romance of the Rose  Christine combats Meun s statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies  She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous females throughout history  These women are  housed  in the City of Ladies  which is actually Christine s book  As Christine builds her city  she uses each famous woman as a building block for not only the walls and houses of the city  but also as building blocks for her thesis  Each woman added to the city adds to Christine s argument towards women as valued participants in society  She also advocates in favor of education for women   Christine de Pizan also finished by 1405 The Treasure of the City of Ladies  Le trésor de la cité des dames  also known The Book of the Three Virtues   a manual of education  dedicated to Princess Margaret of Burgundy  This aims to educate women of all estates  the latter telling women who have husbands   If she wants to act prudently and have the praise of both the world and her husband  she will be cheerful to him all the time   Her Book and Treasure are her two best known works  along with the Ditie de Jehanne D Arc   1  Summary  1 1  Part I  Part I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus’s Lamentations  a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage wherein the author writes that women make men’s lives miserable  Upon reading these words  Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman  “This thought inspired such a great sense of disgust and sadness in me that I began to despise myself and the whole of my sex as an aberration in nature”  The three Virtues then appear to Christine  and each lady tells Christine what her role will be in helping her build the City of Ladies  Lady Reason  a virtue developed by Christine for the purpose of her book  is the first to join Christine and helps her build the external walls of the city  She answers Christine s questions about why some men slander women  helping Christine to prepare the ground on which the city will be built  She tells Christine to “take the spade of  her  intelligence and dig deep to make a trench all around  the city  …  and Reason will  help to carry away the hods of earth on  her  shoulders ” These “hods of earth” are the past beliefs Christine has held  Christine  in the beginning of the text  believed that women must truly be bad because she “could scarcely find a moral work by any author which didn t devote some chapter or paragraph to attacking the female sex   Therefore she  had to accept  these authors  unfavourable opinion s  of women since it was unlikely that so many learned men  who seemed to be endowed with such great intelligence and insight into all things  could possibly have lied on so many different occasions ” Christine is not using reason to discover the merits of women  She believes all that she reads instead of putting her mind to listing all the great deeds women have accomplished  To help Christine see reason  Lady Reason comes and teaches Christine  She helps Christine dispel her own self consciousness and the negative thoughts of past writers  By creating Lady Reason  Christine not only teaches her own allegorical self  but also her readers  She gives not only herself reason  but also gives readers  and women  reason to believe that women are not evil or useless creatures but instead have a significant place within society   1 1 1  Women discussed  These women are discussed in Part I of the Book of the City of Ladies   Queen of Sheba  Fredegund  Semiramis  Amazons  Thamiris  Menalippe  Hippolyta

 1 2  Part II  In Part II  Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine “construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies” and fill it with inhabitants who are “valiant ladies of great renown”  As they build  Lady Rectitude informs Christine with examples and “stories of pagan  Hebrew  and Christian ladies” who possessed the gift of prophecy  chastity  or devotion to their families and others  Christine and Lady Rectitude also discuss the institution of marriage  addressing Christine’s questions regarding men’s claims about the ill qualities women bring to marriage  Lady Rectitude corrects these misconceptions with examples of women who loved their husbands and acted virtuously  noting that those women who are evil toward their husbands are “like creatures who go totally against their nature”  Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste  inconstant  unfaithful  and mean by nature through her stories  This part closes with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city   1 2 1  Women discussed  These women are discussed in Part II of the Book of the City

Justice joins with Christine to “add the finishing touches” to the city  including bringing a queen to rule the city  Lady Justice tells Christine of female saints who were praised for their martyrdom  At the close of this part  Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies  She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen  the virgin Mary   She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers  saying  “Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else  your chastity and your glorious good name”   1 3 1  Women discussed  These women are discussed in Part III of the Book of the City of Ladies   The Virgin Mary  The Virgin Mary s sisters and Mary Magdalene   Saint Catherine   Saint Margaret   Saint Lucy   Blessed Martina   Saint Lucy  different than the Saint Lucy above   Saint Justine  Theodosina  Saint Barbara  and Saint Dorothy  Saint Christine the virgin  Several female saints who were forced to watch their children being martyred  Saint Marina the virgin  Blessed Euphrosyna  Blessed Anastasia  Blessed Theodota  Saint Nathalia  Saint Afra  Several ladies who served the Apostles  2  Boccaccio s influence  Christine s main source for information was Giovanni Boccaccio s De mulieribus claris  On Famous Women   possibly in the French version  Des Cleres et Nobles Femmes  This text was a biographical treatise on ancient famous women  Christine also cited from Boccaccio s Decameron in the latter stages of The City of Ladies  The tales of Ghismonda and Lisabetta  for example  are quoted as coming from Boccaccio s Decameron   Boccaccio s influence can be seen in Christine s stance on female education  In the tale of Rhea Ilia  Boccaccio advocates for young women s right to choose a secular or religious life  He states that it is harmful to place young girls into convents while they are “ignorant  or young  or under coercion ” Boccaccio states that girls should be “well brought up from childhood in the parental home  taught honesty and praiseworthy behavior  and then  when they are grown and with their entire mind know what of their own free will” choose the life of monasticism  Boccaccio believes that young girls need to be taught about life and virtues before they are consecrated to God   While he does not say women should have a formal education  he is still advocating for women to have a say in their lives and the right to be well informed about their possible futures  Therefore  Boccaccio s belief in educating young girls about secular and religious life could have acted as a stepping stone for Christine s belief in female education  Boccaccio s outlook was however  according to Margaret King and Albert Rabil   sexist in that he praised the traditional values of chastity  silence  and obedience in women  and furthermore depicting women in the public sphere as suffering as in form of punishment for transcending boundaries    Boccaccio’s text is mainly used for Parts I and II of the book  while Part III is more reliant upon Jean de Vignay’s Miroir historical  1333   This text is the French translation of the historical portions of Speculum Maius  an encyclopedia by Vincent of Beauvais that was begun after 1240   3  Themes  The Book of the City of Ladies is an allegorical society in which the word  lady  is defined as a woman of noble spirit  instead of noble birth  The book  and therefore the city  contains women of past eras  ranging from pagans to ancient Jews to medieval Christian saints  The book includes discussion between Christine de Pizan and the three female Virtues which are sent to aid Christine build the city  These Virtues – Reason  Rectitude  and Justice – help Christine build the foundations and houses of the city  as well as pick the women who will reside in the city of ladies  Each woman chosen by the Virtues to live in the city acts as a positive example for other women to follow  These women are also examples of the positive influences women have had on society   Christine asks the virtues if women should be taught as men are and why some men think women should not be educated  Other questions that are explored are  the criminality of rape  the natural affinity in women to learn  and their talent for government   4
