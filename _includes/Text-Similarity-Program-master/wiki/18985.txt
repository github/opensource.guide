are comics created in Japan  or by Japanese creators in the Japanese language  conforming to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century  They have a long and complex pre history in earlier Japanese art   In Japan  people of all ages read manga  The medium includes works in a broad range of genres  action adventure  romance  sports and games  historical drama  comedy  science fiction and fantasy  mystery  suspense  detective  horror  sexuality  and business commerce  among others  Although this form of entertainment originated in Japan  many mangas are translated into other languages   mainly English  Since the 1950s  manga has steadily become a major part of the Japanese publishing industry  representing a ¥406 billion market in Japan in 2007  approximately $3 6 billion  and ¥420 billion  $5 5 billion  in 2009  Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience  In Europe and the Middle East the market is worth $250 million  In 2008  in the U S  and Canada  the manga market was valued at $175 million  The markets in France and the United States are about the same size  Manga stories are typically printed in black and white  although some full color manga exist  e g  Colorful   In Japan  manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines  often containing many stories  each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue  If the series is successful  collected chapters may be republished in tankōbon volumes  frequently but not exclusively  paperback books  A manga artist  mangaka in Japanese  typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company  If a manga series is popular enough  it may be animated after or even during its run  Sometimes manga are drawn centering on previously existing live action or animated films   The term manga  kanji    hiragana    katakana      or   is a Japanese word referring both to comics and cartooning   Manga  as a term used outside Japan refers specifically to comics originally published in Japan   Manga influenced comics  among original works  exist in other parts of the world  particularly in China  Hong Kong  and Taiwan   manhua    and South Korea   manhwa    In France   manfra  and  la nouvelle manga  have developed as forms of bande dessinée comics drawn in styles influenced by manga  There are also OEL manga in America too   1  Etymology  The kanji that are used to write the word manga in Japanese can be translated as  whimsical drawings  or  impromptu sketches   Originally an 18th century Chinese literati term  the word first came into common usage in Japan in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden s picturebook Shiji no yukikai  1798   and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa s Manga hyakujo  1814  and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books  1814–1834  containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo e artist Hokusai  Rakuten Kitazawa  1876–1955  first used the word  manga  in the modern sense   In Japanese   manga  refers to all kinds of cartooning  comics  and animation  Among English speakers   manga  has the stricter meaning of  Japanese comics   in parallel to the usage of  anime  in and outside of Japan  The term  ani manga  is used to describe comics produced from animation cels   2  History and characteristics  Modern manga originated in the Occupation  1945–1952  and post Occupation years  1952–early 1960s   while a previously militaristic and ultra nationalist Japan rebuilt its political and economic infrastructure   Writers on manga history have described two broad and complementary processes shaping modern manga  One view emphasizes events occurring during and after the U S  Occupation of Japan  1945–1952   and stresses U S  cultural influences  including U S  comics  brought to Japan by the GIs  and images and themes from U S  television  film  and cartoons  especially Disney   The other view  represented by other writers such as Frederik L  Schodt  Kinko Ito  and Adam L  Kern  stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions  including pre war  Meiji  and pre Meiji culture and art   Regardless of its source  an explosion of artistic creativity certainly occurred in the post war period  involving manga artists such as Osamu Tezuka  Astro Boy  and Machiko Hasegawa  Sazae san   Astro Boy quickly became  and remains  immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere  and the anime adaptation of Sazae san drawing more viewers than any other anime on Japanese television in 2011   Tezuka and Hasegawa both made stylistic innovations  In Tezuka s  cinematographic  technique  the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close up shots  This kind of visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists  Hasegawa s focus on daily life and on women s experience also came to characterize later shōjo manga  Between 1950 and 1969  an increasingly large readership for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres  shōnen manga aimed at boys and shōjo manga aimed at girls   In 1969 a group of female manga artists  later called the Year 24 Group  also known as Magnificent 24s  made their shōjo manga debut   year 24  comes from the Japanese name for the year 1949  the birth year of many of these artists   The group included Moto Hagio  Riyoko Ikeda  Yumiko Oshima  Keiko Takemiya  and Ryoko Yamagishi  Thereafter  primarily female manga artists would draw shōjo for a readership of girls and young women  In the following decades  1975–present   shōjo manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different but overlapping subgenres  Major subgenres include romance  superheroines  and  Ladies Comics   in Japanese  redisu   redikomi   and josei     Modern shōjo manga romance features love as a major theme set into emotionally intense narratives of self realization  With the superheroines  shōjo manga saw releases such as Pink Hanamori s Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Reiko Yoshida s Tokyo Mew Mew  And  Naoko Takeuchi s Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon  which became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats  Groups  or sentais  of girls working together have also been popular within this genre  Like Lucia  Hanon  and Rina singing together  and Sailor Moon  Sailor Mercury  Sailor Mars  Sailor Jupiter  and Sailor Venus working together   Manga for male readers sub divides according to the age of its intended readership  boys up to 18 years old  shōnen manga  and young men 18  to 30 years old  seinen manga   as well as by content  including action adventure often involving male heroes  slapstick humor  themes of honor  and sometimes explicit sexuality  The Japanese use different kanji for two closely allied meanings of  seinen — for  youth  young man  and for  adult  majority —the second referring to sexually overt manga aimed at grown men and also called seijin   adult    manga  Shōnen  seinen  and seijin manga share many features in common   Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II  From the 1950s on  shōnen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypal boy  including subjects like robots  space travel  and heroic action adventure  Popular themes include science fiction  technology  sports  and supernatural settings  Manga with solitary costumed superheroes like Superman  Batman  and Spider Man generally did not become as popular   The role of girls and women in manga produced for male readers has evolved considerably over time to include those featuring single pretty girls  bishōjo  such as Belldandy from Oh My Goddess   stories where such girls and women surround the hero  as in Negima and Hanaukyo Maid Team  or groups of heavily armed female warriors  sentō bishōjo   With the relaxation of censorship in Japan in the 1990s  a wide variety of explicit sexual themes appeared in manga intended for male readers  and correspondingly occur in English translations  However  in 2010 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed a bill to restrict harmful content   The gekiga style of drawing—emotionally dark  often starkly realistic  sometimes very violent—focuses on the day in  day out grim realities of life  often drawn in gritty and unpretty fashions  Gekiga such as Sampei Shirato s 1959–1962 Chronicles of a Ninja s Military Accomplishments  Ninja Bugeichō  arose in the late 1950s and 1960s partly from left wing student and working class political activism and partly from the aesthetic dissatisfaction of young manga artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi with existing manga   3  Publications  In Japan  manga constituted an annual 40 6 billion yen  approximately $395 million USD  publication industry by 2007  In 2006 sales of manga books made up for about 27% of total book sales  and sale of manga magazines  for 20% of total magazine sales  Recently  the manga industry has expanded worldwide  where distribution companies license and reprint manga into their native languages   Marketeers primarily classify manga by the age and gender of the target readership  In particular  books and magazines sold to boys  shōnen  and girls  shōjo  have distinctive cover art  and most bookstores place them on different shelves  Due to cross readership  consumer response is not limited by demographics  For example  male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers  and so on   Japan has manga cafés  or manga kissa  kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten   At a manga kissa  people drink coffee  read manga and sometimes stay overnight   There has been an increase in the amount of publications of original webmanga  It is internationally drawn by enthusiasts of all levels of experience  and is intended for online viewing  It can be ordered in graphic novel form if available in print   The Kyoto International Manga Museum maintains a very large website listing manga published in Japanese   3 1  Magazines  Manga magazines usually have many series running concurrently with approximately 20–40 pages allocated to each series per issue  Other magazines such as the anime fandom magazine Newtype featured single chapters within their monthly periodicals  Other magazines like Nakayoshi feature many stories written by many different artists  these magazines  or  anthology magazines   as they are also known  colloquially  phone books    are usually printed on low quality newsprint and can be anywhere from 200 to more than 850 pages thick  Manga magazines also contain one shot comics and various four panel yonkoma  equivalent to comic strips   Manga series can run for many years if they are successful  Manga artists sometimes start out with a few  one shot  manga projects just to try to get their name out  If these are successful and receive good reviews  they are continued  Magazines often have a short life   3 2  Collected volumes  After a series has run for a while  publishers often collect the episodes together and print them in dedicated book sized volumes  called tankōbon  These can be hardcover  or more usually softcover books  and are the equivalent of U S  trade paperbacks or graphic novels  These volumes often use higher quality paper  and are useful to those who want to  catch up  with a series so they can follow it in the magazines or if they find the cost of the weeklies or monthlies to be prohibitive  Recently   deluxe  versions have also been printed as readers have gotten older and the need for something special grew  Old manga have also been reprinted using somewhat lesser quality paper and sold for 100 yen  about $1 U S  dollar  each to compete with the used book market   3 2 1  History  Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Kyosai created the first manga magazine in 1874  Eshinbun Nipponchi  The magazine was heavily influenced by Japan Punch  founded in 1862 by Charles Wirgman  a British cartoonist  Eshinbun Nipponchi had a very simple style of drawings and did not become popular with many people  Eshinbun Nipponchi ended after three issues  The magazine Kisho Shimbun in 1875 was inspired by Eshinbun Nipponchi  which was followed by Marumaru Chinbun in 1877  and then Garakuta Chinpo in 1879  Shōnen Sekai was the first shōnen magazine created in 1895 by Iwaya Sazanami  a famous writer of Japanese children s literature back then  Shōnen Sekai had a strong focus on the First Sino Japanese War   In 1905 the manga magazine publishing boom started with the Russo Japanese War  Tokyo Pakku was created and became a huge hit  After Tokyo Pakku in 1905  a female version of Shōnen Sekai was created and named Shōjo Sekai  considered the first shōjo magazine  Shōnen Pakku was made and is considered the first children s manga magazine  The children s demographic was in an early stage of development in the Meiji period  Shōnen Pakku was influenced from foreign children s magazines such as Puck which an employee of Jitsugyō no Nihon  publisher of the magazine  saw and decided to emulate  In 1924  Kodomo Pakku was launched as another children s manga magazine after Shōnen Pakku  During the boom  Poten  derived from the French  potin   was published in 1908  All the pages were in full color with influences from Tokyo Pakku and Osaka Puck  It is unknown if there were any more issues besides the first one  Kodomo Pakku was launched May 1924 by Tokyosha and featured high quality art by many members of the manga artistry like Takei Takeo  Takehisa Yumeji and Aso Yutaka  Some of the manga featured speech balloons  where other manga from the previous eras did not use speech balloons and were silent   Published from May 1935 to January 1941  Manga no Kuni coincided with the period of the Second Sino Japanese War  1937–1945   Manga no Kuni featured information on becoming a mangaka and on other comics industries around the world  Manga no Kuni handed its title to Sashie Manga Kenkyū in August 1940   3 3  Dōjinshi  Dōjinshi  produced by small publishers outside of the mainstream commercial market  resemble in their publishing small press independently published comic books in the United States  Comiket  the largest comic book convention in the world with around 500 000 visitors gathering over three days  is devoted to dōjinshi  While they most often contain original stories  many are parodies of or include characters from popular manga and anime series  Some dōjinshi continue with a series  story or write an entirely new one using its characters  much like fan fiction  In 2007  dōjinshi sold for 27 73 billion yen  245 million USD   In 2006 they represented about a tenth of manga books and magazines sales   4  International markets  By 2007 the influence of manga on international comics had grown considerably over the past two decades   Influence  is used here to refer to effects on the comics markets outside of Japan and to aesthetic effects on comics artists internationally   Traditionally  manga stories flow from top to bottom and from right to left  Some publishers of translated manga keep to this original format  Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation  changing the reading direction to a more  Western  left to right  so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics consumers  This practice is known as  flipping   For the most part  criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator  for example  if a person wears a shirt that reads  MAY  on it  and gets flipped  then the word is altered to  YAM    who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions  resulting in an experience that s quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously  If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture  such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic  Characters shown writing with their right hands  the majority of them  would become left handed when a series is flipped  Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts  such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right  or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side  but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow  and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping   4 1  United States  Manga made their way only gradually into U S  markets  first in association with anime and then independently  Some U S  fans became aware of manga in the 1970s and early 1980s  However  anime was initially more accessible than manga to U S  fans  many of whom were college age young people who found it easier to obtain  subtitle  and exhibit video tapes of anime than translate  reproduce  and distribute tankōbon style manga books  One of the first manga translated into English and marketed in the U S  was Keiji Nakazawa s Barefoot Gen  an autobiographical story of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima issued by Leonard Rifas and Educomics  1980–1982   More manga were translated between the mid 1980s and 1990s  including Golgo 13 in 1986  Lone Wolf and Cub from First Comics in 1987  and Kamui  Area 88  and Mai the Psychic Girl  also in 1987 and all from Viz Media Eclipse Comics  Others soon followed  including Akira from Marvel Comics  Epic Comics imprint and Appleseed from Eclipse Comics in 1988  and later Iczer 1  Antarctic Press  1994  and Ippongi Bang s F 111 Bandit  Antarctic Press  1995    In the 1980s to the mid 1990s  Japanese animation  like Akira  Dragon Ball  Neon Genesis Evangelion  and Pokémon  made a bigger impact on the fan experience and in the market than manga  Matters changed when translator entrepreneur Toren Smith founded Studio Proteus in 1986  Smith and Studio Proteus acted as an agent and translator of many Japanese manga  including Masamune Shirow s Appleseed and Kōsuke Fujishima s Oh My Goddess   for Dark Horse and Eros Comix  eliminating the need for these publishers to seek their own contacts in Japan  Simultaneously  the Japanese publisher Shogakukan opened a U S  market initiative with their U S  subsidiary Viz  enabling Viz to draw directly on Shogakukan s catalogue and translation skills   Japanese publishers began pursuing a U S  market in the mid 1990s due to a stagnation in the domestic market for manga  The U S  manga market took an upturn with mid 1990s anime and manga versions of Masamune Shirow s Ghost in the Shell  translated by Frederik L  Schodt and Toren Smith  becoming very popular among fans  An extremely successful manga and anime translated and dubbed in English in the mid 1990s was Sailor Moon  By 1995–1998  the Sailor Moon manga had been exported to over 23 countries  including China  Brazil  Mexico  Australia  North America and most of Europe  In 1997  Mixx Entertainment began publishing Sailor Moon  along with CLAMP s Magic Knight Rayearth  Hitoshi Iwaaki s Parasyte and Tsutomu Takahashi s Ice Blade in the monthly manga magazine MixxZine  Two years later  MixxZine was renamed to Tokyopop before discontinuing in 2011  Mixx Entertainment  later renamed Tokyopop  also published manga in trade paperbacks and  like Viz  began aggressive marketing of manga to both young male and young female demographics   In the following years  manga became increasingly popular  and new publishers entered the field while the established publishers greatly expanded their catalogues  and by 2008  the U S  and Canadian manga market generated $175 million in annual sales  Simultaneously  mainstream U S  media began to discuss manga  with articles in The New York Times  Time magazine  The Wall Street Journal  and Wired magazine   4 2  Europe  Manga has influenced European cartooning in a way that is somewhat different from in the U S   Broadcast anime in Italy and France opened the European market to manga during the 1970s  French art has borrowed from Japan since the 19th century  Japonisme   and has its own highly developed tradition of bande dessinée cartooning  In France  beginning in the mid 1990s  manga has proven very popular to a wide readership  accounting for about one third of comics sales in France since 2004  According to the Japan External Trade Organization  sales of manga reached $212 6 million within France and Germany alone in 2006  France represents about 50% of the European market and is the second worldwide market  behind Japan  In 2013  there were 41 publishers of manga in France and  together with other Asian comics  manga represented around 40% of new comics releases in the country  surpassing Franco Belgian comics for the first time  European publishers marketing manga translated into French include Glénat  Asuka  Casterman  Kana  and Pika Édition  among others   European publishers also translate manga into German  Italian  Dutch  and other languages  In 2007  about 70% of all comics sold in Germany were manga  Manga publishers based in the United Kingdom include Gollancz and Titan Books  Manga publishers from the United States have a strong marketing presence in the United Kingdom  for example  the Tanoshimi line from Random House   5  Localized manga  A number of artists in the United States have drawn comics and cartoons influenced by manga  As an early example  Vernon Grant drew manga influenced comics while living in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s  Others include Frank Miller s mid 1980s Ronin  Adam Warren and Toren Smith s 1988 The Dirty Pair  Ben Dunn s 1987 Ninja High School and Manga Shi 2000 from Crusade Comics  1997    By the 21st century several U S  manga publishers had begun to produce work by U S  artists under the broad marketing label of manga  In 2002 I C  Entertainment  formerly Studio Ironcat and now out of business  launched a series of manga by U S  artists called Amerimanga  In 2004 eigoMANGA launched the Rumble Pak and Sakura Pakk anthology series  Seven Seas Entertainment followed suit with World Manga  Simultaneously  TokyoPop introduced original English language manga  OEL manga  later renamed Global Manga   Francophone artists have also developed their own versions of manga  manfra   like Frédéric Boilet s la nouvelle manga  Boilet has worked in France and in Japan  sometimes collaborating with Japanese artists   6  Awards  The Japanese manga industry grants a large number of awards  mostly sponsored by publishers  with the winning prize usually including publication of the winning stories in magazines released by the sponsoring publisher  Examples of these awards include   the Akatsuka Award for humorous manga  the Dengeki Comic Grand Prix for one shot manga  the Japan Cartoonists Association Award various categories  the Kodansha Manga Award  multiple genre awards   the Seiun Award for best science fiction comic of the year  the Shogakukan Manga Award  multiple genres   the Tezuka Award for best new serial manga  the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize  multiple genres  The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has awarded the International Manga Award annually since May 2007   7  University education  Kyoto Seika University in Japan has offered a highly competitive course in manga since 2000  Then  several established universities and vocational schools  専門学校  Semmon gakkou  established a training curriculum   Shuho Sato  who wrote Umizaru and Say Hello to Black Jack  has created some controversy on Twitter  Sato says  Manga school is meaningless because those schools have very low success rates  Then  I could teach novices required skills on the job in three months  Meanwhile  those school students spend several million yen  and four years  yet they are good for nothing   and that   For instance  Keiko Takemiya  the then professor of Seika Univ   remarked in the Government Council that  A complete novice will be able to understand where is  Tachikiri   i e   margin section  during four years   On the other hand  I would imagine that  It takes about thirty minutes to completely understand that at work    8  See also
