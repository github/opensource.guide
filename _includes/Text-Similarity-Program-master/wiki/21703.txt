In Abrahamic religions  Noah     or Noé or Noach    Nukh       was the tenth and last of the pre flood Patriarchs  The story of Noah s Ark is told in the Torah in the Genesis flood narrative  The biblical account is followed by the story of the curse of Canaan  Besides the book of Genesis  Noah is also mentioned in 1st Chronicles  Isaiah  Ezekiel  the Gospels of Matthew and Luke  the book of Hebrews  and the 1st and 2nd Epistles of Peter  He was the subject of much elaboration in later Abrahamic religions  including the Qur an  Sura 71    1  Biblical account  The primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the book of Genesis   Noah was the tenth of the pre flood  antediluvian  Patriarchs  His father Lamech  called his name Noah  saying  This  same  shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands  because of the ground which the hath cursed   When Noah was five hundred years old  he begat Shem  Ham and Japheth      Genesis chapter six speaks of the conditions before the flood  that led to the decision by the to destroy the earth but there was a delay for  Noah found grace in the eyes of the       A new section   the generations of Noah   is begun in verse 9  and a repeat mention of the birth of Shem  Ham and Japheth appears in verse 10  providing a fixed time reference for what follows     After these things  Noah was instructed by God to  make an ark   and fill it with two of every sort of living thing  and gather  all food that is eaten  for provisions for them all     The chapter ends with Noah s ark loaded with two of every sort  and fully provisioned   according to all that God commanded him    Genesis chapters seven and eight detail events related to the Genesis flood narrative   After the Flood  Noah offered burnt offerings to the   who said   I will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake  for the imagination of man s heart  is  evil from his youth  neither will I again smite any more every thing living  as I have done        And God blessed Noah and his sons  and said unto them  Be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth      They were also told that all fowls  land animals  and fishes would be afraid of them  Furthermore  as well as green plants  every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten  Man s life blood would be required from the beasts and from man   Whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  for in the image of God made he man    9 6  A rainbow  called  my bow   was given as the sign of a covenant  between me and you and every living creature that  is  with you  for perpetual generations      called the Noahic covenant   After this  Noah became a husbandman and he planted a vineyard  and he drank of the wine  and was drunken  and was uncovered within his tent  Noah s son Ham  the father of Canaan  saw the nakedness of his father and told his brethren  which led to Ham s son Canaan being cursed by Noah   Noah died 350 years after the Flood  at the age of 950  the last of the extremely long lived antediluvian Patriarchs  The maximum human lifespan  as depicted by the Bible  diminishes rapidly thereafter  from almost 1 000 years to the 120 years of Moses      2  Other accounts  Noah appears in several non canonical books   2 1  Pseudepigrapha  There is no complete  extant Book of Noah and it does not appear in the lists of Pseudepigrapha  but its existence has been deduced from other texts  A Book of Lamech and a Book of Noria his wife are listed  The Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome  the offspring of the Watchers    In 10 1–3 of the Book of Enoch  which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon   Uriel was dispatched by  the Most High  to inform Noah of the approaching  deluge    2 2  Dead Sea scrolls  There are 20 or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah  About Noah and the flood  Lawrence Schiffman writes   Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved   In particular   The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah   However   The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah   Also  Noah s father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers   3  Origins  3 1  Mesopotamian  The Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh  composed about 2500 BC  contains a flood story almost exactly the same as the Noah story in the Pentateuch  with a few variations such as the number of days of the deluge  the order of the birds  and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests  The flood story in Genesis 6–8 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that  few doubt that  it  derives from a Mesopotamian account   What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale  point by point and in the same order   even when the story permits other alternatives   The earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts   These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark  its flotation  and the subsidence of the waters  as well as the part played by the human protagonist   The Encyclopedia Judaica adds that there is a strong suggestion that  an intermediate agent was active  The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians  whose territory included the city of Haran  where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots  The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia  The encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories  Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that  the hero of the great flood was Babylonia’s tenth antediluvian king   However  there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes  For the Mesopotamian antecedents   the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18 600 to nearly 65 000 years   In the Bible  the lifespans  fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts   Also the name of the hero differs between the traditions   The earliest Mesopotamian flood account  written in the Sumerian language  calls the deluge hero Ziusudra   Gilgamesh’s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC  shortly before the earliest known written stories  The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish  two other kings named in the stories  has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh   The earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur  2100–2000 BC   One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero  as well as a short version of the flood story  The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to ca  2000–1500 BC  Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions  it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth  although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh’s journey to meet Utnapishtim  The  standard  Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin liqe unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC   4  Narrative analysis  According to the documentary hypothesis  the first five books of the Bible  Pentateuch Torah   including Genesis  were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources  which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC  Two of these  the Jahwist  composed in the 10th century BC  and the Priestly source  from the late 7th century BC  make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah  The attempt by the 5th century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took  and how long the flood lasted   The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story  Noah is the first vintner  while Adam is the first farmer  both have problems with their produce  both stories involve nakedness  and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse  However  after the flood  the stories differ  Noah plants the vineyard and utters the curse  not God  so  God is less involved    5  Noah s drunkenness  As early as the Classical era  commentators on have excused Noah s excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker  the first person to discover the soothing  consoling  and enlivening effects of wine  John Chrysostom  Archbishop of Constantinople  and a Church Father  writes that Noah s behaviour is defensible  as the first human to taste wine  he would not know its effects   Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink  fell into a drunken stupor    Philo  a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher  also exonerates Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners   1  to drink wine in excess  a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or  2  to partake of wine as the wise man  Noah being the latter   In Jewish tradition  rabbis blame Satan for saturating the vine with intoxicating properties from the blood of certain animals  thus Noah behaved not knowing what he was doing   6  Curse of Ham  In the field of psychological biblical criticism  J  H  Ellens and W  G  Rollins address the narrative of that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham  Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies  it has been suggested that this narrative is a  splinter from a more substantial tale   A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father  or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham s misdeed  or how Noah came to know what occurred  The narrator relates two facts   1  Noah became drunken and  he was uncovered within his tent   and  2  Ham  saw the nakedness of his father  and told his two brethren without   Thus  these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts  such as and    7  Table of Nations  sets forth the descendants of Shem  Ham  and Japheth  from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the Flood  Among Japheth’s descendants were the maritime nations   10 2–5  Ham’s son Cush had a son named Nimrod  who became the first man of might on earth  a mighty hunter  king in Babylon and the land of Shinar   10 6–10  From there Asshur went and built Nineveh   10 11–12  Canaan’s descendants Sidon  Heth  the Jebusites  the Amorites  the Girgashites  the Hivites  the Arkites  the Sinites  the Arvadites  the Zemarites  and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar  near Gaza  and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah   10 15–19  Among Shem’s descendants was Eber   10 21   These genealogies differ from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11  Also  it is strange that the table  which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth  precedes the account of the Tower of Babel  which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed   8  Religious views  8 1  Judaism  The righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis  The description of Noah as  righteous in his generation  implied to some that his perfection was only relative  In his generation of wicked people  he could be considered righteous  but in the generation of a tzadik like Abraham  he would not be considered so righteous  They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed  as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah  In fact  Noah is never seen to speak  he simply listens to God and acts on his orders  This led such commentators to offer the figure of Noah as  the man in a fur coat   who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour  Others  such as the medieval commentator Rashi  held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years  deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent  Rashi interprets his father s statement of the naming of Noah  in Hebrew נֹחַ   This one will comfort  in Hebrew– yeNaHamainu יְנַחֲמֵנו  from our work and our hands sore from the land that the Lord had cursed   by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity  when there was easing  in Hebrew – nahah – נחה  from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow   According to the Jewish Encyclopedia   The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah   In the first  Noah is the hero of the Flood  and in the second  he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard   The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former   Perhaps the original name of the hero of the Flood was actually Enoch   The Encyclopedia Judaica notes that Noah s drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior  Rather   It is clear that     Noah’s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel’s Canaanite neighbors   It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father’s nakedness  Yet   Noah’s curse     is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham    p  288   8 2  Christianity  According to   Noah is considered a  preacher of righteousness   Of the Gospels in the New Testament  the Gospel of Luke compares Noah s Flood with the coming Day of Judgement   Just as it was in the days of Noah  so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man    The First Epistle of Peter compares the saving power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it  In later Christian thought  the Ark came to be compared to the Church  salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship  as in Noah s time it had been found only within the Ark  St Augustine of Hippo  354–430   demonstrated in The City of God that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body  which corresponds to the body of Christ  the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism  which asks God   who of thy great mercy didst save Noah   to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised   In medieval Christianity  Noah s three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents  Japheth Europe  Shem Asia  and Ham Africa  although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society – the priests  Shem   the warriors  Japheth   and the peasants  Ham   In medieval Christian thought  Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa  So  in racialist arguments  the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races   8 2 1  Mormon theology  In Latter day Saint theology  Noah plays an important role prior to his birth as the angel Gabriel  And then lived in his mortal life as the patriarch prophet Noah  Gabriel and Noah are regarded as the same individual  Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name  Mormons also believe that Noah returned to earth as Gabriel after his earthly life and appeared to Daniel to teach him about the Second Coming  to Zacharias  the father of John the Baptist  and to Mary  the mother of Jesus   Noah is considered the head of a dispensation along with Adam  Enoch  Abraham  Moses  Jesus and Joseph Smith   A dispensation is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood  Noah became the means by which the gospel of Jesus Christ— the plan of salvation —is revealed anew  the means by which divine transforming powers  including saving covenants and ordinances  are extended to people during an age of time called a dispensation   8 3  Islam  Noah is a highly important figure in Islam  and is seen as one of the most significant prophets of all  The Qur an contains 43 references to Noah  or Nuh  in 28 chapters  and the seventy first chapter  Sūrat Nūḥ    or Chapter Noah  is named after him  His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends  Noah s narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge  Noah s narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories  which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment  Noah is not the first prophet sent to mankind  according to the Qur an  The first prophet according to Islam is Adam  who was the first man and he was sent to populate earth  Noah has several titles in Islam  based primarily on praise for him in the Qur an  including True Messenger of Allah  XXVI  107  and Grateful Servant of Allah  XVII  3    The Qur an focuses on several instances from Noah s life more than others  and one of the most significant events is the Deluge  Allah makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham  Moses  Jesus and Muhammad later on  33 7   Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel  10 72–74   Moreover  the people mock Noah s words and call him a liar  7 62   and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach  54 9   Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in Allah s message  11 29   and Noah s narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public  Noah prays to Allah to say   Lord  leave not one single family of Infidels on the Earth    For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners  infidels   The Qur an narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark  after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning  The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens  destroying all the sinners  Even one of his sons disbelieved him  stayed behind  and was drowned  In the Qur an  Noah originally had four sons  but they are not named  After the Great Flood ceased  the Ark rested atop Mount Judi     Also  Islam beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the after effects of doing so   states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started   According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran  the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation  which extended until the time of Abraham  950 years   The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress  which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah   8 4  Gnostic  An important Gnostic text  the Apocryphon of John  reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made  but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon s plans  and Noah informed the remainder of humanity  Unlike the account of Genesis  not only are Noah s family saved  but many others also heed Noah s call  There is no ark in this account  According to Elaine Pagels   Rather  they hid in a particular place  not only Noah  but also many other people from the unshakable race  They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud    8 5  Bahá í  The Bahá í Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic  In Bahá í belief  only Noah s followers were spiritually alive  preserved in the ark of his teachings  as others were spiritually dead  The Bahá í scripture Kitáb i Íqán endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions  either 40 or 72  besides his family on the Ark  and that he taught for 950  symbolic  years before the flood   8 6  Isaac Newton  Isaac Newton  in his religious works on the development of religion  wrote about Noah and his offspring  In Newton s view  while Noah was a monotheist  the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants   Newton argues that Noah is ultimately deified as the god Saturn    Newton thus traces all ancient political and religious history back to Noah and Noah s offspring and simultaneously gives an historical account of the rise of polytheism and idolatry in these gentile nations as the result of the posthumous deification of their leaders and heroes  a polytheistic process which thoroughly corrupts the core monotheistic truth     in the original religion of Noah   9  Comparative mythology  Many non Middle Eastern civilizations have flood myths  and some have very similar stories containing characters who are very like Noah  Thinkers have argued that these similarities are evidence that Noah actually existed  being called different names by different peoples  Others have argued that civilizations must have borrowed details of Noah s life for their own Noah types  or that they all spring from the same source  Yet others say that these Noah like stories are completely unrelated   9 1  Ancient Greek  Noah has often been compared to Deucalion  the son of Prometheus and Pronoia in Greek mythology  Like Noah  Deucalion is warned of the flood  this time by Zeus and Poseidon   he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures – and when he completes his voyage  gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth  Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch  Deucalion  in some versions of the myth  also becomes the inventor of wine  like Noah  Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah  and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that  therefore  Noah existed   9 2  Hindu  A story involving Lord Vishnu and King Manu is found in the Hindu chronicle Matsya Purana  Lord Vishnu in his  matsya   fish  avatar ordered the virtuous king Manu to construct a huge boat with animal and plant specimens of all forms  to escape the Great Deluge  and finally when the water receded the great boat was found atop the Malaya Mountains  Encyclopaedia Britannica notes that  Manu combines the characteristics of the Hebrew Bible figures of Noah  who preserved life from extinction in a great flood  and Adam  the first man   which view is reflected in several other works  Indologist David Dean Shulman writes that borrowing between the myths of Manu and Noah  cannot be ruled out   For Christian apologist Krishna Mohan Banerjee  the names  Noah  and  Manu   had the same etymological root   Manu  must have been the Indo Aryan ideal of Noah   Philologist and founder of the Asiatic Society of Bengal  William Jones   identifies Manu with Noah   along with whom   the seven sages can be identified with the eight people aboard the Ark   Furthermore  researcher Klaus Klostermaier reports a Muslim writer who  identifies Brahma with Abraham      and Manu with Noah   Others  however  would say that  the story is thoroughly Indian  and the  boat is not the equivalent of Noah s Ark  though it is still the symbol of salvation   10
