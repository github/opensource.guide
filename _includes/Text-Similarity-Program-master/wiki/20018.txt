In mathematics  a metric space is a set for which distances between all members of the set are defined  Those distances  taken together  are called a metric on the set   The most familiar metric space is 3 dimensional Euclidean space  In fact  a  metric  is the generalization of the Euclidean metric arising from the four long known properties of the Euclidean distance  The Euclidean metric defines the distance between two points as the length of the straight line segment connecting them  Other metric spaces occur for example in elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry  where distance on a sphere measured by angle is a metric  and the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry is used by special relativity as a metric space of velocities   A metric on a space induces topological properties like open and closed sets  which lead to the study of more abstract topological spaces   In the most general definition of a metric space  the distance between set elements can be negative  Spaces like these are important in the theory of relativity   1  History  Maurice Fréchet introduced metric spaces in his work Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel  Rendic  Circ  Mat  Palermo 22  1906  1–74   2  Definition  A metric space is an ordered pair where is a set and is a metric on   i e   a function  such that for any   the following holds        non negative    iff      identity of indiscernibles         symmetry  and       triangle inequality    The first condition follows from the other three  since  for any    The function is also called distance function or simply distance  Often  is omitted and one just writes for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used   Ignoring mathematical details  for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations  To be a metric there shouldn t be any one way roads  The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren t shortcuts  Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea   3  Examples of metric spaces  The real numbers with the distance function given by the absolute difference  and more generally Euclidean  space with the Euclidean distance  are complete metric spaces  The rational numbers with the same distance also form a metric space  but are not complete   The positive real numbers with distance function is a complete metric space   Any normed vector space is a metric space by defining   see also metrics on vector spaces   If such a space is complete  we call it a Banach space   Examples   The Manhattan norm gives rise to the Manhattan distance  where the distance between any two points  or vectors  is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates   The maximum norm gives rise to the Chebyshev distance or chessboard distance  the minimal number of moves a chess king would take to travel from to    The British Rail metric  also called the Post Office metric or the SNCF metric  on a normed vector space is given by for distinct points and   and   More generally can be replaced with a function taking an arbitrary set to non negative reals and taking the value at most once  then the metric is defined on by for distinct points and   and   The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys  or letters  to proceed via London  or Paris  irrespective of their final destination   If is a metric space and is a subset of   then becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of to    The discrete metric  where if and otherwise  is a simple but important example  and can be applied to all non empty sets  This  in particular  shows that for any non empty set  there is always a metric space associated to it  Using this metric  any point is an open ball  and therefore every subset is open and the space has the discrete topology   A finite metric space is a metric space having a finite number of points  Not every finite metric space can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space   The hyperbolic plane is a metric space  More generally   If is any connected Riemannian manifold  then we can turn into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the infimum of the lengths of the paths  continuously differentiable curves  connecting them   If is some set and is a metric space  then  the set of all bounded functions  i e  those functions whose image is a bounded subset of   can be turned into a metric space by defining for any two bounded functions and  where is supremum  This metric is called the uniform metric or supremum metric  and If is complete  then this function space is complete as well  If X is also a topological space  then the set of all bounded continuous functions from to  endowed with the uniform metric   will also be a complete metric if M is   If is an undirected connected graph  then the set of vertices of can be turned into a metric space by defining to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices and   In geometric group theory this is applied to the Cayley graph of a group  yielding the word metric   The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the dissimilarity between two strings and   defined as the minimal number of character deletions  insertions  or substitutions required to transform into   This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an edit distance   Given a metric space and an increasing concave function such that if and only if   then is also a metric on    Given an injective function from any set to a metric space   defines a metric on    Using T theory  the tight span of a metric space is also a metric space  The tight span is useful in several types of analysis   The set of all by matrices over some field is a metric space with respect to the rank distance    The Helly metric is used in game theory   4  Open and closed sets  topology and convergence  Every metric space is a topological space in a natural manner  and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces   About any point in a metric space we define the open ball of radius about as the set  These open balls form the base for a topology on M  making it a topological space   Explicitly  a subset of is called open if for every in there exists an such that is contained in   The complement of an open set is called closed  A neighborhood of the point is any subset of that contains an open ball about as a subset   A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a metrizable space  see the article on metrization theorems for further details   A sequence    in a metric space is said to converge to the limit iff for every   there exists a natural number N such that for all   Equivalently  one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces   A subset of the metric space is closed iff every sequence in that converges to a limit in has its limit in    5  Types of metric spaces  5 1  Complete spaces  A metric space is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence converges in   That is to say  if as both and independently go to infinity  then there is some with    Every Euclidean space is complete  as is every closed subset of a complete space  The rational numbers  using the absolute value metric   are not complete   Every metric space has a unique  up to isometry  completion  which is a complete space that contains the given space as a dense subset  For example  the real numbers are the completion of the rationals   If is a complete subset of the metric space   then is closed in   Indeed  a space is complete iff it is closed in any containing metric space   Every complete metric space is a Baire space   5 2  Bounded and totally bounded spaces  A metric space M is called bounded if there exists some number r  such that d x y  ≤ r for all x and y in M  The smallest possible such r is called the diameter of M  The space M is called precompact or totally bounded if for every r   0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius r whose union covers M  Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite  it has finite diameter  from which it follows  using the triangle inequality  that every totally bounded space is bounded  The converse does not hold  since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric  one of the examples above  under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded   Note that in the context of intervals in the space of real numbers and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space Rn a bounded set is referred to as  a finite interval  or  finite region   However boundedness should not in general be confused with  finite   which refers to the number of elements  not to how far the set extends  finiteness implies boundedness  but not conversely  Also note that an unbounded subset of Rn may have a finite volume   5 3  Compact spaces  A metric space M is compact if every sequence in M has a subsequence that converges to a point in M  This is known as sequential compactness and  in metric spaces  but not in general topological spaces   is equivalent to the topological notions of countable compactness and compactness defined via open covers   Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval  0 1  with the absolute value metric  all metric spaces with finitely many points  and the Cantor set  Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact   A metric space is compact iff it is complete and totally bounded  This is known as the Heine–Borel theorem  Note that compactness depends only on the topology  while boundedness depends on the metric   Lebesgue s number lemma states that for every open cover of a compact metric space M  there exists a  Lebesgue number  δ such that every subset of M of diameter   δ is contained in some member of the cover   Every compact metric space is second countable  and is a continuous image of the Cantor set   The latter result is due to Pavel Alexandrov and Urysohn    5 4  Locally compact and proper spaces  A metric space is said to be locally compact if every point has a compact neighborhood  Euclidean spaces are locally compact  but infinite dimensional Banach spaces are not   A space is proper if every closed ball  y   d x y  ≤ r  is compact  Proper spaces are locally compact  but the converse is not true in general   5 5  Connectedness  A metric space is connected if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and itself   A metric space is path connected if for any two points there exists a continuous map with and   Every path connected space is connected  but the converse is not true in general   There are also local versions of these definitions  locally connected spaces and locally path connected spaces   Simply connected spaces are those that  in a certain sense  do not have  holes    5 6  Separable spaces  A metric space is separable space if it has a countable dense subset  Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space  For metric spaces  but not for general topological spaces  separability is equivalent to second countability and also to the Lindelöf property   6  Types of maps between metric spaces  Suppose  M1 d1  and  M2 d2  are two metric spaces   6 1  Continuous maps  The map f M1→M2 is continuous if it has one  and therefore all  of the following equivalent properties   General topological continuity  for every open set U in M2  the preimage f  1 U  is open in M1  Moreover  f is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of M1   The image of every compact set under a continuous function is compact  and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected   6 2  Uniformly continuous maps  The map ƒ   M1 → M2 is uniformly continuous if for every ε   0 there exists δ   0 such that  Every uniformly continuous map ƒ   M1 → M2 is continuous  The converse is true if M1 is compact  Heine–Cantor theorem    Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in M1 into Cauchy sequences in M2  For continuous maps this is generally wrong  for example  a continuous map from the open interval  0 1  onto the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences   6 3  Lipschitz continuous maps and contractions  Given a number K   0  the map ƒ   M1 → M2 is K Lipschitz continuous if  Every Lipschitz continuous map is uniformly continuous  but the converse is not true in general   If K   1  then ƒ is called a contraction  Suppose M2   M1 and M1 is complete  If ƒ is a contraction  then ƒ admits a unique fixed point  Banach fixed point theorem   If M1 is compact  the condition can be weakened a bit  ƒ admits a unique fixed point if  6 4  Isometries  The map f M1→M2 is an isometry if  Isometries are always injective  the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete  respectively  However  if the isometry is not surjective  then the image of a closed  or open  set need not be closed  or open    6 5  Quasi isometries  The map f   M1 → M2 is a quasi isometry if there exist constants A ≥ 1 and B ≥ 0 such that  and a constant C ≥ 0 such that every point in M2 has a distance at most C from some point in the image f M1    Note that a quasi isometry is not required to be continuous  Quasi isometries compare the  large scale structure  of metric spaces  they find use in geometric group theory in relation to the word metric   7  Notions of metric space equivalence  Given two metric spaces  M1  d1  and  M2  d2    They are called homeomorphic  topologically isomorphic  if there exists a homeomorphism between them  i e   a bijection continuous in both directions    They are called uniformic  uniformly isomorphic  if there exists a uniform isomorphism between them  i e   a bijection uniformly continuous in both directions    They are called isometric if there exists a bijective isometry between them  In this case  the two metric spaces are essentially identical   They are called quasi isometric if there exists a quasi isometry between them   8  Topological properties  Metric spaces are paracompact Hausdorff spaces and hence normal  indeed they are perfectly normal   An important consequence is that every metric space admits partitions of unity and that every continuous real valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space  Tietze extension theorem   It is also true that every real valued Lipschitz continuous map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz continuous map on the whole space   Metric spaces are first countable since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base   The metric topology on a metric space M is the coarsest topology on M relative to which the metric d is a continuous map from the product of M with itself to the non negative real numbers   9  Distance between points and sets  Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric  A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set  as required for a completely regular space  is to consider the distance between the point and the set  If  M d  is a metric space  S is a subset of M and x is a point of M  we define the distance from x to S as  Then d x  S    0 if and only if x belongs to the closure of S  Furthermore  we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality   which in particular shows that the map is continuous   Given two subsets S and T of M  we define their Hausdorff distance to be  In general  the Hausdorff distance dH S T  can be infinite  Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set   The Hausdorff distance dH turns the set K M  of all non empty compact subsets of M into a metric space  One can show that K M  is complete if M is complete   A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the Kuratowski convergence    One can then define the Gromov–Hausdorff distance between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces  Using this distance  the class of all  isometry classes of  compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right   10  Product metric spaces  If are metric spaces  and N is the Euclidean norm on Rn  then is a metric space  where the product metric is defined by  and the induced topology agrees with the product topology  By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions  an equivalent metric is obtained if N is the taxicab norm  a p norm  the max norm  or any other norm which is non decreasing as the coordinates of a positive n tuple increase  yielding the triangle inequality    Similarly  a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric  An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable  For example  is not first countable and thus isn t metrizable   10 1  Continuity of distance  It is worth noting that in the case of a single space   the distance map  from the definition  is uniformly continuous with respect to any of the above product metrics   and in particular is continuous with respect to the product topology of    11  Quotient metric spaces  If M is a metric space with metric d  and ~ is an equivalence relation on M  then we can endow the quotient set M ~ with the following  pseudo metric  Given two equivalence classes  x  and  y   we define  where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences and with       In general this will only define a pseudometric  i e  does not necessarily imply that   However for nice equivalence relations  e g   those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces   it is a metric  Moreover if M is a compact space  then the induced topology on M ~ is the quotient topology   The quotient metric d is characterized by the following universal property  If is a metric map between metric spaces  that is  for all x  y  satisfying f x  f y  whenever then the induced function   given by   is a metric map  A topological space is sequential if and only if it is a quotient of a metric space   12  Generalizations of metric spaces  Every metric space is a uniform space in a natural manner  and every uniform space is naturally a topological space  Uniform and topological spaces can therefore be regarded as generalizations of metric spaces   If we consider the first definition of a metric space given above and relax the second requirement  we arrive at the concepts of a pseudometric space or a dislocated metric space  If we remove the third or forth  we arrive at a quasimetric space  or a semimetric space   If the distance function takes values in the extended real number line R∪ +∞   but otherwise satisfies all four conditions  then it is called an extended metric and the corresponding space is called an  metric space  If the distance function takes values in some  suitable  ordered set  and the triangle inequality is adjusted accordingly   then we arrive at the notion of generalized ultrametric   Approach spaces are a generalization of metric spaces  based on point to set distances  instead of point to point distances   A continuity space is a generalization of metric spaces and posets  that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and domains   12 1  Metric spaces as enriched categories  The ordered set can be seen as a category by requesting exactly one morphism if and none otherwise  By using as the tensor product and as the identity  it becomes a monoidal category   Every metric space can now be viewed as a category enriched over    Set  For each set  The composition morphism will be the unique morphism in given from the triangle inequality  The identity morphism will be the unique morphism given from the fact that    Since is a strict monoidal category  all diagrams that are required for an enriched category commute automatically  See the paper by F W  Lawvere listed below   13  See also  Space  mathematics   Metric  mathematics   Metric signature  Metric tensor  Metric
