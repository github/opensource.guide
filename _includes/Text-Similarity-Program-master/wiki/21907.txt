The Seven Laws of Noah   Sheva mitzvot B nei Noach   or the Noahide Laws  are a set of moral imperatives that  according to the Talmud  were given by God as a binding set of laws for the  children of Noah  – that is  all of humanity   Accordingly  any non Jew who adheres to these laws is regarded as a righteous gentile  and is assured of a place in the world to come   Olam Haba   the final reward of the righteous   The seven Noahide laws as traditionally enumerated are   Do Not Deny God  Do Not Blaspheme God  Do Not Murder  Do Not Engage in Incestuous  Adulterous or Homosexual Relationships   Do Not Steal  Do Not Eat of a Live Animal  Establish Functioning Courts of Law According to Rabbinic tradition  the Noahide laws are derived exegetically from the few commandments which were given to Adam in the Garden of Eden    and a seventh precept regarding animals  which was added after the Flood of Noah   Maimonides rules that Moses was commanded by God to compel the world to accept these seven commandments  For many centuries  however  the circumstances did not allow this to be done  But in 1983  Rabbi Menachem M  Schneerson said it was time to revitalize this long dormant aspect and role of the Jewish people  In 1987  President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation speaking of “the historical tradition of ethical values and principles  which have been the bedrock of society from the dawn of civilization when they were known as the Seven Noahide Laws  transmitted through God to Moses on Mount Sinai ” and in 1991  Congress did the same   1  Origins  1 1  Hebrew Torah  According to the Genesis flood narrative  a deluge covered the whole world  killing every surface dwelling creature except Noah  his wife  his sons and their wives  and the animals taken aboard Noah s Ark  According to this  all modern humans are descendants of Noah  thus the name Noahide Laws in reference to laws that apply to all of humanity  After the flood  God sealed a covenant with Noah with the following admonitions      Flesh of a living animal   However  flesh with its life blood  in it   you shall not eat    9 4   Murder and courts   Furthermore  I will demand your blood  for  the taking of  your lives  I shall demand it  even  from any wild animal  From man too  I will demand of each person s brother the blood of man  He who spills the blood of man  by man his blood shall be spilt  for in the image of God He made man    9 5–6   1 2  Book of Jubilees  The Book of Jubilees  generally dated to the 2nd century BCE  may include an early reference to Noachide Law at verses 7 20–28   1 3  Acts 15  The Jewish Encyclopedia article on Saul of Tarsus states   The article  New Testament  states   The Apostolic Decree of the Council of Jerusalem resolved this early Christian dispute by commending that gentiles obey Noahide law    rather than to live under the same dictates as Torah observant Jews and be circumcised  cf        1 4  Talmud  According to Judaism  as expressed in the Talmud  the Noachide Laws apply to all humanity through humankind s descent from one paternal ancestor  the head of the only family to survive The Flood  who in Hebrew tradition is called Noah  In Judaism  בני נח B nei Noah  Hebrew   Descendants of Noah    Children of Noah   refers to all of humankind  The Talmud also states   Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come   Sanhedrin 105a   Any non Jew who lives according to these laws is regarded as one of  the righteous among the gentiles    The Talmud states that the instruction not to eat  flesh with the life  was given to Noah  and that Adam and Eve had already received six other commandments  Adam and Eve were not enjoined from eating from a living animal  they were forbidden to eat any animal  The remaining six are exegetically derived from the sentence  And the Lord God commanded the man saying  of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat   in    Historically  some rabbinic opinions consider non Jews not only not obliged to adhere to all the remaining laws of the Torah  but actually forbidden to observe them  The Noachide Laws are regarded as the way through which non Jews can have a direct and meaningful relationship with God  or at least comply with the minimal requisites of civilization and of divine law   Noachide law differs radically from Roman law for gentiles  Jus Gentium   if only because the latter was enforceable judicial policy  Rabbinic Judaism has never adjudicated any cases under Noachide law  per Novak  1983 28ff    although scholars disagree about whether Noachide law is a functional part of Halakha   Jewish law    cf  Bleich    In recent years  the term  Noahide  has come to refer to non Jews who strive to live in accord with the seven Noachide Laws  the terms  observant Noahide  or  Torah centered Noahides  would be more precise but are infrequently used  Support for the use of Noahide in this sense can be found with the Ritva  who uses the term Son of Noah to refer to a Gentile who keeps the seven laws  but is not a Ger Toshav  The rainbow  referring to the Noachide or First Covenant  Genesis 9   is the symbol of many organized Noahide groups  following   A non Jew of any ethnicity or religion is referred to as a bat   daughter   or ben   son   of Noah  However  most organizations that call themselves בני נח  b nei noach   Sons of Noah   are composed of gentiles who are keeping the Noachide Laws   1 5  Maimonides  The Jewish scholar Maimonides  12th century  held that Gentiles may have a part in the world to come just by observing Noahide law  He writes in his book of laws    Some later editions of the Mishnah Torah differ by one letter and read “Nor one of their wise men ” The later reading is narrower  Spinoza read Maimonides as using nor and accused him of being narrow and particularistic  Other philosophers such as Hermann Cohen and Moses Mendelssohn have used more inclusive interpretations of the passage by Maimonides  In either reading  Maimonides appears to exclude philosophical Noahides from being Righteous Gentiles  Thus Maimonides wants to emphasis that a truly Righteous Gentile follows the seven laws because they are divinely revealed and thus are followed out of obedience to God   2  Subdividing the Seven Laws  Various rabbinic sources have different positions on the way the seven laws are to be subdivided in categories  Maimonides lists other additional Noahide commandments  including the coupling of different kinds of animals and the grafting of different species  as defined by Jewish law  of trees  Maimonides  in his Mishnah Torah  also interpreted the prohibition against homicide as including a prohibition against abortion  Rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra  Radbaz   a contemporary commentator on Maimonides  expressed surprise that he left out castration and sorcery which were listed in the Talmud   In Chullin 92a b Ulla say that here are 30 laws which the sons of Noah took upon themselves  However he only lists three  Namely the three that the Gentiles follow  not to create a Ketubah between males  not to sell carrion in the market and to respect the Torah  The rest of the laws are not listed  Talmud commentator Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to  Though the authorities seem to take it for granted that Ulla s thirty commandments included the original seven  an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading  Two different lists of the 30 laws exist  Both lists include an additional twenty three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws  One from the 16th century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza  Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven  nor based on Scripture  but instead were passed down by oral tradition   The 10th century Rabbi Saadia Gaon added tithes and levirate marriage  The 11th century Rav Nissim Gaon included  listening to God s Voice    knowing God  and  serving God  besides going on to say that all religious acts which can be understood through human reasoning are obligatory upon Jew and Gentile alike  The 14th century Rabbi Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi added the commandment of charity   The contemporary Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein counts 66 instructions  but Rabbi Harvey Falk has suggested that much work remains to be done in order to properly identify all of the Noahide Commandments  their divisions and subdivisions  Theft  robbery and stealing covers the appropriate understanding of other persons  their property and their rights  The establishment of courts of justice promotes the value of the responsibility of a corporate society of people to enforce these laws and define these terms  The refusal to engage in unnecessary lust or cruelty demonstrates respect for the creation itself as renewed after the Flood  The prohibition against committing murder includes a prohibition against human sacrifice   3  Ger toshav  resident alien   In earlier times  a Gentile living in the Land of Israel who accepted the Seven Laws in front of a rabbinical court was known as a Ger toshav  literally stranger resident  or  resident alien   Jewish law recognizes a Biblical obligation to help a Ger toshav in time of need  as opposed to the rabbinic obligation help all Gentiles who live among Jews   The regulations regarding Jewish Gentile relations are modified in the case of a Ger toshav   Jewish law only allows the official acceptance of a Ger Toshav as a resident in the Land of Israel during a time when the Year of Jubilee  yovel  is in effect  There is discussion in the sources as to whether some of the laws that apply to a Ger Toshav may be applied to some modern Gentiles  particularly Muslims   A Ger Toshav should not be confused with a Ger Tzedek  who is a person who prefers to proceed to total conversion to Judaism  a procedure that is traditionally only allowed to take place after much thought and deliberation over converting   4  Punishment  The Talmud laid down the statutory punishment for transgressing any one of the Seven Laws of Noah  but not other parts of the Noahide code  as capital punishment by decapitation  which is considered one of the lightest of the four modes of execution of criminals  According to some opinions  punishment is the same whether the individual transgresses with knowledge of the law or is ignorant of the law   5  Christianity and the Noahide Laws  Acts 15 is commonly seen as a parallel to Noahide Law  however  some modern Jewish and Christian scholars dispute the connection between Acts 15 and Noahide law  the content of Noahide law  the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles  and the nature of Biblical law in Christianity   The only Noahide law that is not part of the standard moral teaching of mainstream Christianity is the prohibition against eating the flesh of an animal while it is still alive  Many interpret Acts and the Pauline Epistles as making void the dietary laws found in the Torah and known by Noah   and    This claim is disputed by many Christians  including the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church  the Seventh day Adventist Church  the Church of God  Seventh Day   The Apostolic Decree which is recorded in and still observed by the Orthodox includes some food restrictions and is commonly seen as a parallel to the Noahide Laws   The 18th century rabbi Jacob Emden proposed that Jesus  and Paul after him  intended to convert the gentiles to the Noahide laws while allowing the Jews to follow the full Law of Moses  This approach is generally considered to be dual covenant theology   6  Modern views  Some modern views hold that penalties are a detail of the Noahide Laws and that Noahides themselves must determine the details of their own laws for themselves  According to this school of thought – see N  Rakover  Law and the Noahides  1998   M  Dallen  The Rainbow Covenant  2003  – the Noahide Laws offer mankind a set of absolute values and a framework for righteousness and justice  while the detailed laws that are currently on the books of the world s states and nations are presumptively valid   6 1  Sefer Sheva Mitzvot Hashem  A Shulchan Aruch for Gentiles  After the Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch  Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson  started his Noahide Campaign in the 1980s  the number of Gentiles willing to keep the Seven Laws of Noah as described in the Torah increased  A codification of the exact obligations of the Gentiles in the spirit of the classical Shulchan Aruch was needed  In 2005 the scholar Rabbi Moshe Weiner of Jerusalem accepted to produce an in depth codification of the Noahide precepts  The work is called Sefer Sheva Mitzvot HaShem   The Book of Seven Divine Commandments  published 2008 2009  As it was approved by both of the then presiding Chief Rabbis of Israel  Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar and Rabbi Yonah Metzger  as well as other Hasidic  and non Hasidic halachic authorities like Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg  Rabbi Gedalia Dov Schwartz and Rabbi Jacob Immanuel Schochet  it can claim an authoritative character and is referred as a  Shulchan Aruch  for Gentiles at many places   7  Public endorsement  7 1  United States Congress  The Seven Laws of Noah were recognized by the United States Congress in the preamble to the 1991 bill that established Education Day in honor of the birthday of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson  the leader of the Chabad movement   7 2  Israeli Druze  In January 2004  Sheikh Mowafak Tarif  the spiritual leader of Israeli Druze  signed a declaration  which called on non Jews living in the land of Israel to observe the Noahide Laws  He was joined by the mayor of Shefa  Amr   8  See also  Code of Hammurabi  List of ancient legal codes  Natural law  Noahidism  Shituf  9  References  10  Further reading  Barre Elisheva   Torah for Gentiles – the
