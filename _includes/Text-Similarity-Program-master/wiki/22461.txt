Osteoporosis   porous bones   from Greek  οστούν ostoun meaning  bone  and πόρος poros meaning  pore   is a progressive bone disease that is characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density which can lead to an increased risk of fracture  In osteoporosis  the bone mineral density  BMD  is reduced  bone microarchitecture deteriorates  and the amount and variety of proteins in bone are altered  Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization  WHO  as a bone mineral density of 2 5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass  average of young  healthy adults  as measured by dual energy X ray absorptiometry  the term  established osteoporosis  includes the presence of a fragility fracture  The disease may be classified as primary type 1  primary type 2  or secondary  The form of osteoporosis most common in women after menopause is referred to as primary type 1 or postmenopausal osteoporosis  which is attributable to the decrease in estrogen production after menopause  Primary type 2 osteoporosis or senile osteoporosis occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2 1  Secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and affect men and women equally  this form results from chronic predisposing medical problems or disease  or prolonged use of medications such as glucocorticoids  when the disease is called steroid  or glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis   The risk of osteoporosis fractures can be reduced with lifestyle changes and in those with previous osteoporosis related fractures  medications  Lifestyle change includes diet  exercise  and preventing falls  A review by the U S  Preventive Services Task Force  USPSTF  found insufficient evidence to recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent fractures  Bisphosphonates are useful in those with previous fractures from osteoporosis but are of minimal benefit in those who have osteoporosis but no previous fractures  Osteoporosis is a component of the frailty syndrome   1  Signs and symptoms  Osteoporosis itself has no symptoms  its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures  Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone  they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures  Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column  rib  hip and wrist   1 1  Fractures  Fractures are the most dangerous aspect of osteoporosis  Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from osteoporosis and can lead to further disability and early mortality  These fractures may also be asymptomatic  The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist  spine  shoulder and hip  The symptoms of a vertebral collapse   compression fracture   are sudden back pain  often with radicular pain  shooting pain due to nerve root compression  and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome  Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture  loss of height  and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility   Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery  Hip fracture  in particular  usually requires prompt surgery  as serious risks are associated with it  such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism  and increased mortality   Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria  including BMD  age  smoking  alcohol usage  weight  and gender  Recognized calculators include FRAX and Dubbo   1 2  Falls risk  The increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist  spine  and hip  The risk of falling  in turn  is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause  e g  glaucoma  macular degeneration   balance disorder  movement disorders  e g  Parkinson s disease   dementia  and sarcopenia  age related loss of skeletal muscle   Collapse  transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness  leads to a significant risk of falls  causes of syncope are manifold  but may include cardiac arrhythmias  irregular heart beat   vasovagal syncope  orthostatic hypotension  abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up   and seizures  Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls  Those with previous falls  as well as those with gait or balance disorders  are most at risk   2  Risk factors  Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and  potentially  modifiable  In addition  osteoporosis is a recognized complication in specific diseases and disorders  Medication use is theoretically modifiable  although in many cases  the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable  Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis   It is more likely for a female to get osteoporosis than a male   2 1  Nonmodifiable  The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age  in both men and women  and female sex  estrogen deficiency following menopause or oophorectomy is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density  while in men  a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable  but less pronounced  effect   Race  While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups  European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis   Heredity  Those with a family history of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk  the heritability of the fracture  as well as low bone mineral density  are relatively high  ranging from 25 to 80%  At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis   Those who have already had a fracture are at least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex  Early menopause hysterectomy is another predisposing factor   Build  A small stature is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis   2 2  Potentially modifiable  Excess consumption of alcohol  Although small amounts of alcohol are probably beneficial  bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake   chronic heavy drinking  alcohol intake greater than three units day  probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density   Vitamin D deficiency  Low circulating Vitamin D is common among the elderly worldwide  Mild vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone  PTH  production  PTH increases bone resorption  leading to bone loss  A positive association exists between serum 1 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and bone mineral density  while PTH is negatively associated with bone mineral density   Tobacco smoking  Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health  but the mechanisms are unclear  Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts  and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis  Smoking also results in increased breakdown of exogenous estrogen  lower body weight and earlier menopause  all of which contribute to lower bone mineral density   Malnutrition  Nutrition has an important and complex role in maintenance of good bone  Identified risk factors include low dietary calcium and or phosphorus  magnesium  zinc  boron  iron  fluoride  copper  vitamins A  K  E and C  and D where skin exposure to sunlight provides an inadequate supply   Excess sodium is a risk factor  High blood acidity may be diet related  and is a known antagonist of bone  Some have identified low protein intake as associated with lower peak bone mass during adolescence and lower bone mineral density in elderly populations  Conversely  some have identified low protein intake as a positive factor  protein is among the causes of dietary acidity  Imbalance of omega 6 to omega 3 polyunsaturated fats is yet another identified risk factor   High dietary protein  Research has found an association between diets high in animal protein and increased urinary calcium  and have been linked to an increase in fractures  However  the relevance of this observation to bone density is unclear  since higher protein diets tend to increase absorption of calcium from the diet and are associated with higher bone density  Indeed  it has recently been argued that low protein diets cause poor bone health  No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis   Underweight inactive  Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress  so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss  Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence  and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined  The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people   Endurance training  In female endurance athletes  large volumes of training can lead to decreased bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis  This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation  producing amenorrhea  and it is part of the female athlete triad  However  for male athletes  the situation is less clear  and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes  others have instead seen increased leg bone density   Heavy metals  A strong association between cadmium and lead with bone disease has been established  Low level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders  leading to pain and increased risk of fractures  especially in the elderly and in females  Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia  softening of the bone    Soft drinks  Some studies indicate soft drinks  many of which contain phosphoric acid  may increase risk of osteoporosis  at least in women  Others suggest soft drinks may displace calcium containing drinks from the diet rather than directly causing osteoporosis   2 3  Medical disorders  Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis  For some  the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward  whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown   In general  immobilization causes bone loss  following the  use it or lose it  rule   For example  localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast  This is also more common in active people with a high bone turn over  for example  athletes   Other examples include bone loss during space flight or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons   Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis  These include Turner syndrome  Klinefelter syndrome  Kallmann syndrome  anorexia nervosa  andropause  hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia  In females  the effect of hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency  It can appear as early menopause   45 years  or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea   1 year   Bilateral oophorectomy  surgical removal of the ovaries  and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production  In males  testosterone deficiency is the cause  for example  andropause or after surgical removal of the testes    Endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss include Cushing s syndrome  hyperparathyroidism  hyperthyroidism  hypothyroidism  diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2  acromegaly  and adrenal insufficiency  In pregnancy and lactation can cause reversible bone loss   Malnutrition  parenteral nutrition and malabsorption can lead to osteoporosis  Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include coeliac disease  Crohn s disease  Ulcerative colitis  cystic fibrosis  lactose intolerance  surgery  after gastrectomy  intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection  and severe liver disease  especially primary biliary cirrhosis   People with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis  Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and or vitamin D  Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute   People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis  ankylosing spondylitis  systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis  either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors  notably corticosteroid therapy   Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis   Renal insufficiency can lead to renal osteodystrophy   Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies  lymphoma and leukemia  mastocytosis  hemophilia  sickle cell disease and thalassemia   Several inherited disorders have been linked to osteoporosis  These include osteogenesis imperfecta  Marfan syndrome  hemochromatosis  hypophosphatasia  for which it is often misdiagnosed   glycogen storage diseases  homocystinuria  Ehlers–Danlos syndrome  porphyria  Menkes  syndrome  epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher s disease   People with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis  Bone loss can be a feature of complex regional pain syndrome  It is also more frequent in people with Parkinson s disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   People with Parkinson s disease have a higher risk of broken bones  This is related to poor balance and poor bone density  In Parkinson’s disease there may be a link between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and altered calcium metabolism  and iron metabolism  causing a stiffening of the skeleton and kyphosis   2 4  Medication  Certain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk  only steroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated  but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs   Steroid induced osteoporosis  SIOP  arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing s syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton  The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake  Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30 mg hydrocortisone  7 5 mg of prednisolone   especially when this is in excess of three months  Alternate day use may not prevent this complication   Barbiturates  phenytoin and some other enzyme inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D   L Thyroxine over replacement may contribute to osteoporosis  in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does  This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism   Several drugs induce hypogonadism  for example aromatase inhibitors used in breast cancer  methotrexate and other antimetabolite drugs  depot progesterone and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists   Anticoagulants – long term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density  and warfarin  and related coumarins  have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long term use   Proton pump inhibitors – these drugs inhibit the production of stomach acid  this is thought to interfere with calcium absorption  Chronic phosphate binding may also occur with aluminium containing antacids   Thiazolidinediones  used for diabetes  – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone  inhibitors of PPARγ  have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture   Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis   2 5  Evolutionary  Age related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species  Because of the more porous bones of humans  frequency of severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures is higher  The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such  It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force  In addition  the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support  One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis   3  Pathogenesis  The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation  In normal bone  matrix remodeling of bone is constant  up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time  The process takes place in bone multicellular units  BMUs  as first described by Frost in 1963  Bone is resorbed by osteoclast cells  which derive from the bone marrow   after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells   The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass  the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth   excessive bone resorption  and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling  An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue  Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption  lack of estrogen  e g  as a result of menopause  increases bone resorption  as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight bearing bones  The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland  The α form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover  In addition to estrogen  calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover  and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition  in addition  the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone  parathormone  PTH   which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood  The role of calcitonin  a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition  is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH   The activation of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals  of which the receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand  RANKL  is one of best studied  This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells  e g  lymphocytes   and stimulates RANK  receptor activator of nuclear factor κB   Osteoprotegerin  OPG  binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK  and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption  RANKL  RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors  The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized  but less well understood  Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover  and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis   Trabecular bone  or cancellous bone  is the sponge like bone in the ends of long bones and vertebrae  Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones  Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones  trabecular bone is more active  and is more subject to bone turnover and remodeling  Not only is bone density decreased  but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted  The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break   microcracks    and are replaced by weaker bone  Common osteoporotic fracture sites  the wrist  the hip and the spine  have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio  These areas rely on trabecular bone for strength  so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced  Around the ages of 30–35  cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins  Women may lose as much as 50%  while men lose about 30%   4  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density  BMD   The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual energy x ray absorptiometry  In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD  the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes  this may be done with blood tests  Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem  investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone  multiple myeloma  Cushing s disease and other above mentioned causes may be performed   4 1  Conventional radiography  Conventional radiography is useful  both by itself and in conjunction with CT or MRI  for detecting complications of osteopenia  reduced bone mass  preosteoporosis   such as fractures  for differential diagnosis of osteopenia  or for follow up examinations in specific clinical settings  such as soft tissue calcifications  secondary hyperparathyroidism  or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy  However  radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss  about 30%  to be apparent on X ray images   The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency  Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow up  Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain film X rays by using several methods such as height loss together with area reduction  particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4 L4  or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved  Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine  leading to what is known as dowager s hump   4 2  Dual energy X ray  Dual energy X ray absorptiometry  DXA  is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis  Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2 5 standard deviations below that of a young  30–40 year old 58   healthy adult women reference population  This is translated as a T score  But because bone density decreases with age  more people become osteoporotic with increasing age  58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines   The International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone  It also states  for premenopausal women  Z scores  comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass  rather than T scores should be used  and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone   4 3  Biomarkers  Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation  The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type I collagen protein  an important constituent in bones  Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment  called a neoepitope  as a way to diagnose osteoporosis  Increased urinary excretion of C telopeptides  a type I collagen breakdown product  also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis   4 4  Other measuring tools  Quantitative computed tomography differs from DXA in that it gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg cm3 rather than BMD s relative Z score  Among QCT s advantages  it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites  can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose  is sensitive to change over time  can analyze a region of any size or shape  excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat  muscle  and air  and does not require knowledge of the patient s subpopulation in order to create a clinical score  e g  the Z score of all females of a certain age   Among QCT s disadvantages  it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA  CT scanners are large and expensive  and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD  its results are more operator dependent  Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT   Quantitative ultrasound has many advantages in assessing osteoporosis  The modality is small  no ionizing radiation is involved  measurements can be made quickly and easily  and the cost of the device is low compared with DXA and QCT devices  The calcaneus is the most common skeletal site for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone  providing early evidence of metabolic change  Also  the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel  reducing repositioning errors  The method can be applied to children  neonates  and preterm infants  just as well as to adults  Once microimaging tools to examine specific aspects of bone quality are developed  it is expected that quantitative ultrasound will be increasingly used in clinical practice   4 5  Screening  The U S  Preventive Services Task Force  USPSTF  recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry  Additionally they recommend screening women with increased risk factors that puts them at risk equivalent to a 65 year old  There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening  In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown  A number of tool exist to help determine who is reasonable to test   5  Management  5 1  Lifestyle  Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors  As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis  smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it   Weight bearing endurance exercise and or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis  Aerobics  weight bearing  and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women  Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications  There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically among those who are in care homes   5 2  Nutrition  Studies of the benefits of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting  possibly because most studies did not have patients with low dietary intakes  A 2013 review by the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin D results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women  The USPSTF did not recommend low dose supplementation  less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D  in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk  It is unknown what effect higher doses have   While some meta analyses have found a benefit of vitamin D supplements combined with calcium for fractures  they did not find a benefit of vitamin D supplements alone   While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death  there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions  kidney stones  and stomach problems  Vitamin K supplementation may reduce the risk of fractures in post menopausal women  however there is no evidence for men   5 3  Medications  Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis  This benefit is present when taken for three to four years  They have not been compared directly to each other  though  so it is not known if one is better  Fracture risk reduction is between 25 and 70% depending on the bone involved  There are concerns of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with long term use  but these risks are low  With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events  it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time in some   For those with osteoporosis but who have not had any fractures evidence does not support a reduction of in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate  Alendronate may decrease fractures of the spine but does not have any effect on other types of fractures  Half stop their medications within a year   Teriparatide   a recombinant parathyroid hormone   has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis  Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  Hormone replacement therapy  while effective for osteoporosis  is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms  Raloxifene  while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures  does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture  And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer  it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes  Denosumab is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures  In hypogonadal men  testosterone has been shown to improve bone quantity and quality  but  as of 2008  no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels  Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer with its use and questionable effect on fracture risk   Certain drugs like alendronate  etidronate  risedronate  raloxifene and strontium ranelate can be helpful for the preventing of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis   6  Prognosis  Although osteoporosis patients have an increased mortality rate due to the complications of fracture  it is rarely lethal   Hip fractures can lead to decreased mobility and additional risks of numerous complications  such as deep venous thrombosis and or pulmonary embolism  and pneumonia   The six month mortality rate following hip fracture is around 13 5%  and a substantial proportion  almost 13%  of people who have suffered a hip fracture need total assistance to mobilize after a hip fracture   Vertebral fractures  while having a smaller impact on mortality  can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin  which can be hard to control  as well as deformity  Though rare  multiple vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back  kyphosis   the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one s ability to breathe   Apart from risk of death and other complications  osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health related quality of life   7  Epidemiology  Osteoporosis affects 55% of Americans aged 50 and above  Of these  approximately 80% are women  The condition is responsible for millions of fractures annually  mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae  hip  and wrist  Fragility fractures of ribs are also common in men   7 1  Hip fractures  Hip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis  In the United States  more than 250 000 hip fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis  A 50 year old white woman is estimated to have a 17 5% lifetime risk of fracture of the proximal femur  The incidence of hip fractures increases each decade from the sixth through the ninth for both women and men for all populations  The highest incidence is found among men and women ages 80 or older   7 2  Vertebral fractures  Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebral fracture  In the United States  700 000 vertebral fractures occur annually  but only about a third are recognized  In a series of 9704 women aged 68 8 on average studied for 15 years  324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry into the study and 18 2% developed a vertebral fracture  but that risk rose to 41 4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture   7 3  Wrist fractures  In the United States  250 000 wrist fractures annually are attributable to osteoporosis  Wrist fractures are the third most common type of osteoporotic fractures  The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles  fracture is about 16% for white women  By the time women reach age 70  about 20% have had at least one wrist fracture   7 4  Rib fractures  Fragility fractures of the ribs are common in men as young as age 35  These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis  as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity  An example would be as a result of falling while water skiing or jet skiing  However  a quick test of the individual s testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk   8  History  The link between age related reductions in bone density and fracture risk goes back at least to Astley Cooper  and the term  osteoporosis  and recognition of its pathological appearance is generally attributed to the French pathologist Jean Lobstein  The American endocrinologist Fuller Albright linked osteoporosis with the postmenopausal state  Bisphosphonates  which revolutionized the treatment of osteoporosis  were discovered in the 1960s   9  References  10  External links
