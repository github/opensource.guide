An operating system  OS  is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs  The operating system is an essential component of the system software in a computer system  Application programs usually require an operating system to function   Time sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time  mass storage  printing  and other resources   For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation  the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware  although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make a system call to an OS function or be interrupted by it  Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers   Examples of popular modern operating systems include Android  BSD  iOS  Linux  OS X  QNX  Microsoft Windows  Windows Phone  and IBM z OS  All these examples  except Windows  Windows Phone and z OS  share roots in UNIX   1  Types of operating systems  1 1  Real time  A real time operating system is a multitasking operating system that aims at executing real time applications  Real time operating systems often use specialized scheduling algorithms so that they can achieve a deterministic nature of behavior  The main objective of real time operating systems is their quick and predictable response to events  They have an event driven or time sharing design and often aspects of both  An event driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events while time sharing operating systems switch tasks based on clock interrupts  Time sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time  mass storage  printing  and other resources   1 2  Multi user  A multi user operating system allows multiple users to access a computer system at the same time  Time sharing systems and Internet servers can be classified as multi user systems as they enable multiple user access to a computer through the sharing of time  Single user operating systems have only one user but may allow multiple programs to run at the same time   1 3  Multi tasking vs  single tasking  A multi tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running at the same time  from the point of view of human time scales  A single tasking system has only one running program  Multi tasking can be of two types  pre emptive and co operative  In pre emptive multitasking  the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates one slot to each of the programs  Unix like operating systems such as Solaris and Linux support pre emptive multitasking  as does AmigaOS  Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to give time to the other processes in a defined manner  16 bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi tasking  32 bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x  used pre emptive multi tasking  Mac OS prior to OS X used to support cooperative multitasking   1 4  Distributed  A distributed operating system manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear to be a single computer  The development of networked computers that could be linked and communicate with each other gave rise to distributed computing  Distributed computations are carried out on more than one machine  When computers in a group work in cooperation  they make a distributed system   1 5  Templated  In an OS  distributed and cloud computing context  templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system  then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines  Gagne  2012  p  716   The technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management  and is common in large server warehouses   1 6  Embedded  Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems  They are designed to operate on small machines like PDAs with less autonomy  They are able to operate with a limited number of resources  They are very compact and extremely efficient by design  Windows CE and Minix 3 are some examples of embedded operating systems   2  History  Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks  like a calculator  Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s  such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing  Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s  Hardware features were added  that enabled use of runtime libraries  interrupts  and parallel processing  When personal computers became popular in the 1980s  operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers   In the 1940s  the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating systems  Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards  These were special purpose systems that  for example  generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards  After programmable general purpose computers were invented  machine languages  consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape  were introduced that sped up the programming process  Stern  1981    In the early 1950s  a computer could execute only one program at a time  Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited period of time and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and or punched tape  The program would be loaded into the machine  and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed  Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights  It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine  and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine   Later machines came with libraries of programs  which would be linked to a user s program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human readable symbolic code  This was the genesis of the modern day operating system  However  machines still ran a single job at a time  At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes pegs to indicate job priority   2 1  Mainframes  Through the 1950s  many major features were pioneered in the field of operating systems  including batch processing  input output interrupt  buffering  multitasking  spooling  runtime libraries  link loading  and programs for sorting records in files  These features were included or not included in application software at the option of application programmers  rather than in a separate operating system used by all applications  In 1959  the SHARE Operating System was released as an integrated utility for the IBM 704  and later in the 709 and 7090 mainframes  although it was quickly supplanted by IBSYS IBJOB on the 709  7090 and 7094   During the 1960s  IBM s OS 360 introduced the concept of a single OS spanning an entire product line  which was crucial for the success of the System 360 machines  IBM s current mainframe operating systems are distant descendants of this original system and applications written for OS 360 can still be run on modern machines   OS 360 also pioneered the concept that the operating system keeps track of all of the system resources that are used  including program and data space allocation in main memory and file space in secondary storage  and file locking during update  When the process is terminated for any reason  all of these resources are re claimed by the operating system   The alternative CP 67 system for the S 360 67 started a whole line of IBM operating systems focused on the concept of virtual machines  Other operating systems used on IBM S 360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM  COS 360  Compatibility Operating System   DOS 360  Disk Operating System   TSS 360  Time Sharing System   TOS 360  Tape Operating System   BOS 360  Basic Operating System   and ACP  Airline Control Program   as well as a few non IBM systems  MTS  Michigan Terminal System   MUSIC  Multi User System for Interactive Computing   and ORVYL  Stanford Timesharing System    Control Data Corporation developed the SCOPE operating system in the 1960s  for batch processing  In cooperation with the University of Minnesota  the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s  which supported simultaneous batch and timesharing use  Like many commercial timesharing systems  its interface was an extension of the Dartmouth BASIC operating systems  one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages  In the late 1970s  Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO operating system  which used plasma panel displays and long distance time sharing networks  Plato was remarkably innovative for its time  featuring real time chat  and multi user graphical games   In 1961  Burroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 with the MCP   Master Control Program  operating system  The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high level languages with no machine language or assembler  and indeed the MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high level language – ESPOL  a dialect of ALGOL  MCP also introduced many other ground breaking innovations  such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory  During development of the AS400  IBM made an approach to Burroughs to licence MCP to run on the AS400 hardware  This proposal was declined by Burroughs management to protect its existing hardware production  MCP is still in use today in the Unisys ClearPath MCP line of computers   UNIVAC  the first commercial computer manufacturer  produced a series of EXEC operating systems  Like all early main frame systems  this batch oriented system managed magnetic drums  disks  card readers and line printers  In the 1970s  UNIVAC produced the Real Time Basic  RTB  system to support large scale time sharing  also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system   General Electric and MIT developed General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor  GECOS   which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege levels  After acquisition by Honeywell it was renamed General Comprehensive Operating System  GCOS    Digital Equipment Corporation developed many operating systems for its various computer lines  including TOPS 10 and TOPS 20 time sharing systems for the 36 bit PDP 10 class systems  Before the widespread use of UNIX  TOPS 10 was a particularly popular system in universities  and in the early ARPANET community   From the late 1960s through the late 1970s  several hardware capabilities evolved that allowed similar or ported software to run on more than one system  Early systems had utilized microprogramming to implement features on their systems in order to permit different underlying computer architectures to appear to be the same as others in a series  In fact  most 360s after the 360 40  except the 360 165 and 360 168  were microprogrammed implementations   The enormous investment in software for these systems made since the 1960s caused most of the original computer manufacturers to continue to develop compatible operating systems along with the hardware  Notable supported mainframe operating systems include   Burroughs MCP – B5000  1961 to Unisys Clearpath MCP  present   IBM OS 360 – IBM System 360  1966 to IBM z OS  present   IBM CP 67 – IBM System 360  1967 to IBM z VM  present   UNIVAC EXEC 8 – UNIVAC 1108  1967  to OS 2200 Unisys Clearpath Dorado  present   2 2  Microcomputers  The first microcomputers did not have the capacity or need for the elaborate operating systems that had been developed for mainframes and minis  minimalistic operating systems were developed  often loaded from ROM and known as monitors  One notable early disk operating system was CP M  which was supported on many early microcomputers and was closely imitated by Microsoft s MS DOS  which became widely popular as the operating system chosen for the IBM PC  IBM s version of it was called IBM DOS or PC DOS   In the  80s  Apple Computer Inc   now Apple Inc   abandoned its popular Apple II series of microcomputers to introduce the Apple Macintosh computer with an innovative Graphical User Interface  GUI  to the Mac OS   The introduction of the Intel 80386 CPU chip with 32 bit architecture and paging capabilities  provided personal computers with the ability to run multitasking operating systems like those of earlier minicomputers and mainframes  Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler  who had developed the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation  He would lead the development of the Windows NT operating system  which continues to serve as the basis for Microsoft s operating systems line  Steve Jobs  a co founder of Apple Inc   started NeXT Computer Inc   which developed the NEXTSTEP operating system  NEXTSTEP would later be acquired by Apple Inc  and used  along with code from FreeBSD as the core of Mac OS X   The GNU Project was started by activist and programmer Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a complete free software replacement to the proprietary UNIX operating system  While the project was highly successful in duplicating the functionality of various parts of UNIX  development of the GNU Hurd kernel proved to be unproductive  In 1991  Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds  with cooperation from volunteers collaborating over the Internet  released the first version of the Linux kernel  It was soon merged with the GNU user space components and system software to form a complete operating system  Since then  the combination of the two major components has usually been referred to as simply  Linux  by the software industry  a naming convention that Stallman and the Free Software Foundation remain opposed to  preferring the name GNU Linux  The Berkeley Software Distribution  known as BSD  is the UNIX derivative distributed by the University of California  Berkeley  starting in the 1970s  Freely distributed and ported to many minicomputers  it eventually also gained a following for use on PCs  mainly as FreeBSD  NetBSD and OpenBSD   3  Examples of operating systems  3 1  Unix and Unix like operating systems  File Unix history simple png 256px thumb Evolution of Unix systems default Unix was originally written in assembly language  Ken Thompson wrote B  mainly based on BCPL  based on his experience in the MULTICS project  B was replaced by C  and Unix  rewritten in C  developed into a large  complex family of inter related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system  see History    The Unix like family is a diverse group of operating systems  with several major sub categories including System V  BSD  and Linux  The name  UNIX  is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions   UNIX like  is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX   Unix like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures  They are used heavily for servers in business  as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments  Free UNIX variants  such as Linux and BSD  are popular in these areas   Four operating systems are certified by The Open Group  holder of the Unix trademark  as Unix  HP s HP UX and IBM s AIX are both descendants of the original System V Unix and are designed to run only on their respective vendor s hardware  In contrast  Sun Microsystems s Solaris Operating System can run on multiple types of hardware  including x86 and Sparc servers  and PCs  Apple s OS X  a replacement for Apple s earlier  non Unix  Mac OS  is a hybrid kernel based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP  Mach  and FreeBSD   Unix interoperability was sought by establishing the POSIX standard  The POSIX standard can be applied to any operating system  although it was originally created for various Unix variants   3 1 1  BSD and its descendants  A subgroup of the Unix family is the Berkeley Software Distribution family  which includes FreeBSD  NetBSD  and OpenBSD  These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers  although they can also function as a personal computer OS  The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD  as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to connect  send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BSD  The World Wide Web was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NextStep   BSD has its roots in Unix  In 1974  University of California  Berkeley installed its first Unix system  Over time  students and staff in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier  such as text editors  When Berkeley received new VAX computers in 1978 with Unix installed  the school s undergraduates modified Unix even more in order to take advantage of the computer s hardware possibilities  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense took interest  and decided to fund the project  Many schools  corporations  and government organizations took notice and started to use Berkeley s version of Unix instead of the official one distributed by AT&T   Steve Jobs  upon leaving Apple Inc  in 1985  formed NeXT Inc   a company that manufactured high end computers running on a variation of BSD called NeXTSTEP  One of these computers was used by Tim Berners Lee as the first webserver to create the World Wide Web   Developers like Keith Bostic encouraged the project to replace any non free code that originated with Bell Labs  Once this was done  however  AT&T sued  Eventually  after two years of legal disputes  the BSD project came out ahead and spawned a number of free derivatives  such as FreeBSD and NetBSD   3 1 1 1  OS X  OS X  formerly  Mac OS X   is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed  marketed  and sold by Apple Inc   the latest of which is pre loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers  OS X is the successor to the original Mac OS  which had been Apple s primary operating system since 1984  Unlike its predecessor  OS X is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997  The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1 0  with a desktop oriented version  Mac OS X v10 0  Cheetah   following in March 2001  Since then  six more distinct  client  and  server  editions of OS X have been released  until the two were merged in OS X 10 7  Lion   Releases of OS X v10 0 through v10 8 are named after big cats  Starting with v10 9   Mavericks   OS X versions are named after inspirational places in California  OS X 10 10  Yosemite   the most recent version  was announced and released on June 2  2014 at the WWDC 2014   Prior to its merging with OS X  the server edition – OS X Server – was architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apple s line of Macintosh server hardware  OS X Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services  including a mail transfer agent  a Samba server  an LDAP server  a domain name server  and others  With Mac OS X v10 7 Lion  all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been integrated into the client version and the product re branded as  OS X   dropping  Mac  from the name   The server tools are now offered as an application   3 1 2  Linux and GNU  The GNU project is a mass collaboration of programmers who seek to create a completely free and open operating system that was similar to Unix but with completely original code  It was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman  and is responsible for many of the parts of most Linux variants  Thousands of pieces of software for virtually every operating system are licensed under the GNU General Public License  Meanwhile  the Linux kernel began as a side project of Linus Torvalds  a university student from Finland  In 1991  Torvalds began work on it  and posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers  He received a wave of support and volunteers who ended up creating a full fledged kernel  Programmers from GNU took notice  and members of both projects worked to integrate the finished GNU parts with the Linux kernel in order to create a full fledged operating system   GNU Linux  or Linux or GNU+Linux  is a Unix like operating system that was developed without any actual Unix code  unlike BSD and its variants  GNU Linux can be used on a wide range of devices from supercomputers to wristwatches  The Linux kernel is released under an open source license  so anyone can read and modify its code  It has been modified to run on a large variety of electronics  Although estimates suggest that GNU Linux is used on 1 82% of all personal computers  it has been widely adopted for use in servers and embedded systems  such as cell phones   GNU Linux has superseded Unix in most places  and is used on the 10 most powerful supercomputers in the world  The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions  such as Red Hat  Debian  Ubuntu  Linux Mint and Google s Android   3 1 2 1  Google Chromium OS  Chromium is an operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed by Google  Since Chromium OS targets computer users who spend most of their time on the Internet  it is mainly a web browser with limited ability to run local applications  though it has a built in file manager and media player  Instead  it relies on Internet applications  or Web apps  used in the web browser to accomplish tasks such as word processing  Chromium OS differs from Chrome OS in that Chromium is open source and used primarily by developers whereas Chrome OS is the operating system shipped out in Chromebooks   3 2  Microsoft Windows  Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers  with an estimated 88 9 percent total usage share on Web connected computers  The newest version is Windows 8 1 for workstations and Windows Server 2012 R2 for servers  Windows 7 recently overtook Windows XP as most used OS   Microsoft Windows originated in 1985 as an operating environment running on top of MS DOS  which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time  In 1995  Windows 95 was released which only used MS DOS as a bootstrap  For backwards compatibility  Win9x could run real mode MS DOS and 16 bits Windows 3 x drivers  Windows ME  released in 2000  was the last version in the Win9x family  Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel  Current client versions of Windows run on IA 32  x86 64 and 32 bit ARM microprocessors  In addition Itanium is still supported in older server version Windows Server 2008 R2  In the past  Windows NT supported additional architectures   Server editions of Windows are widely used  In recent years  Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system  However  Windows  usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers  as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market share   3 3  Other  There have been many operating systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so  such as AmigaOS  OS 2 from IBM and Microsoft  Mac OS  the non Unix precursor to Apple s Mac OS X  BeOS  XTS 300  RISC OS  MorphOS  Haiku  BareMetal and FreeMint  Some are still used in niche markets and continue to be developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications  OpenVMS formerly from DEC  is still under active development by Hewlett Packard  Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia  for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts  A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX  while for example Singularity is used purely for research   Other operating systems have failed to win significant market share  but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating systems  not least Bell Labs  Plan 9   4  Components  The components of an operating system all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work together  All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware  whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component   4 1  Kernel  With the aid of the firmware and device drivers  the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computer s hardware devices  It manages memory access for programs in the RAM  it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources  it sets up or resets the CPU s operating states for optimal operation at all times  and it organizes the data for long term non volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks  tapes  flash memory  etc   4 1 1  Program execution  The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware  so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system  The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs  Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources  establishes a priority for the process in multi tasking systems  loads program binary code into memory  and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices   4 1 2  Interrupts  Interrupts are central to operating systems  as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to its environment  The alternative — having the operating system  watch  the various sources of input for events  polling  that require action — can be found in older systems with very small stacks  50 or 60 bytes  but are unusual in modern systems with large stacks  Interrupt based programming is directly supported by most modern CPUs  Interrupts provide a computer with a way of automatically saving local register contexts  and running specific code in response to events  Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts  and allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes place   When an interrupt is received  the computer s hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running  saves its status  and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt  this is analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone call  In modern operating systems  interrupts are handled by the operating system s kernel  Interrupts may come from either the computer s hardware or from the running program   When a hardware device triggers an interrupt  the operating system s kernel decides how to deal with this event  generally by running some processing code  The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt  for example  a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone   The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called device driver  which may be either part of the operating system s kernel  part of another program  or both  Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means   A program may also trigger an interrupt to the operating system  If a program wishes to access hardware for example  it may interrupt the operating system s kernel  which causes control to be passed back to the kernel  The kernel will then process the request  If a program wishes additional resources  or wishes to shed resources  such as memory  it will trigger an interrupt to get the kernel s attention   4 1 3  Modes  Modern CPUs support multiple modes of operation  CPUs with this capability use at least two modes  protected mode and supervisor mode  The supervisor mode is used by the operating system s kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware  such as controlling how memory is written and erased  and communication with devices like graphics cards  Protected mode  in contrast  is used for almost everything else  Applications operate within protected mode  and can only use hardware by communicating with the kernel  which controls everything in supervisor mode  CPUs might have other modes similar to protected mode as well  such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types  such as 16 bit processors on a 32 bit one  or 32 bit processors on a 64 bit one   When a computer first starts up  it is automatically running in supervisor mode  The first few programs to run on the computer  being the BIOS or EFI  bootloader  and the operating system have unlimited access to hardware – and this is required because  by definition  initializing a protected environment can only be done outside of one  However  when the operating system passes control to another program  it can place the CPU into protected mode   In protected mode  programs may have access to a more limited set of the CPU s instructions  A user program may leave protected mode only by triggering an interrupt  causing control to be passed back to the kernel  In this way the operating system can maintain exclusive control over things like access to hardware and memory   The term  protected mode resource  generally refers to one or more CPU registers  which contain information that the running program isn t allowed to alter  Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode  where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting  for example  by killing the program    4 1 4  Memory management  Among other things  a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs  This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program  Since programs time share  each program must have independent access to memory   Cooperative memory management  used by many early operating systems  assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel s memory manager  and do not exceed their allocated memory  This system of memory management is almost never seen any more  since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory  If a program fails  it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten  Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program s memory  or may affect the operation of the operating system itself  With cooperative memory management  it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system   Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process  access to the computer s memory  Various methods of memory protection exist  including memory segmentation and paging  All methods require some level of hardware support  such as the 80286 MMU   which doesn t exist in all computers   In both segmentation and paging  certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access  Attempts to access other addresses will trigger an interrupt which will cause the CPU to re enter supervisor mode  placing the kernel in charge  This is called a segmentation violation or Seg V for short  and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation  and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program  the kernel will generally resort to terminating the offending program  and will report the error   Windows versions 3 1 through ME had some level of memory protection  but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it  A general protection fault would be produced  indicating a segmentation violation had occurred  however  the system would often crash anyway   4 1 5  Virtual memory  The use of virtual memory addressing  such as paging or segmentation  means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time  allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks   If a program tries to access memory that isn t in its current range of accessible memory  but nonetheless has been allocated to it  the kernel will be interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory   See section on memory management   Under UNIX this kind of interrupt is referred to as a page fault   When the kernel detects a page fault it will generally adjust the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it  granting it access to the memory requested  This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular application s memory is stored  or even whether or not it has actually been allocated yet   In modern operating systems  memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs  This is called swapping  as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs  and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand    Virtual memory  provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really there   4 1 6  Multitasking  Multitasking refers to the running of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer  giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time  Since most computers can do at most one or two things at one time  this is generally done via time sharing  which means that each program uses a share of the computer s time to execute   An operating system kernel contains a piece of software called a scheduler which determines how much time each program will spend executing  and in which order execution control should be passed to programs  Control is passed to a process by the kernel  which allows the program access to the CPU and memory  Later  control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism  so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU  This so called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch   An early model which governed the allocation of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking  In this model  when control is passed to a program by the kernel  it may execute for as long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel  This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU  but it can hang the entire system if it enters an infinite loop   Modern operating systems extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code  so that the operating system has preemptive control over internal run times as well   The philosophy governing preemptive multitasking is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time on the CPU  This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupted  To accomplish this  modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrupt  A protected mode timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to supervisor mode after the specified time has elapsed   See above sections on Interrupts and Dual Mode Operation    On many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate  as home computers generally run a small number of well tested programs  The AmigaOS is an exception  having pre emptive multitasking from its very first version  Windows NT was the first version of Microsoft Windows which enforced preemptive multitasking  but it didn t reach the home user market until Windows XP  since Windows NT was targeted at professionals    4 1 7  Disk access and file systems  Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating systems  Computers store data on disks using files  which are structured in specific ways in order to allow for faster access  higher reliability  and to make better use out of the drive s available space  The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a file system  and enables files to have names and attributes  It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a directory tree   Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system  Early file systems were limited in their capacity  speed  and in the kinds of file names and directory structures they could use  These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for  making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system   While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems  operating systems like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS  An operating system such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices  regardless of their design or file systems  allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface  API   This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing  A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them  through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers   A connected storage device  such as a hard drive  is accessed through a device driver  The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives  On UNIX  this is the language of block devices   When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place  it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format  which may contain one or more file systems  A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems  Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames  and directories folders  contained within a hierarchical structure  They can create  delete  open  and close files  as well as gather various information about them  including access permissions  size  free space  and creation and modification dates   Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficult  Allowed characters in file names  case sensitivity  and the presence of various kinds of file attributes makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting task  Operating systems tend to recommend using  and so support natively  file systems specifically designed for them  for example  NTFS in Windows and ext3 and ReiserFS in Linux  However  in practice  third party drives are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general purpose operating systems  for example  NTFS is available in Linux through NTFS 3g  and ext2 3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through third party software    Support for file systems is highly varied among modern operating systems  although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers for  Operating systems vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed on  Under Windows  each file system is usually limited in application to certain media  for example  CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF  and as of Windows Vista  NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on  It is possible to install Linux onto many types of file systems  Unlike other operating systems  Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in  whether it is a hard drive  a disc  CD  DVD      a USB flash drive  or even contained within a file located on another file system   4 1 8  Device drivers  A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices  Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device  through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to  providing commands to and or receiving data from the device  and on the other end  the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications  It is a specialized hardware dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program  typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel  to interact transparently with a hardware device  and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time dependent hardware interfacing needs   The key design goal of device drivers is abstraction  Every model of hardware  even within the same class of device  is different  Newer models also are released by manufacturers that provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often controlled differently  Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device  both now and in the future  To solve this problem  operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled  The function of the device driver is then to translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific calls  In theory a new device  which is controlled in a new manner  should function correctly if a suitable driver is available  This new driver will ensure that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating system s point of view   Under versions of Windows before Vista and versions of Linux before 2 6  all driver execution was co operative  meaning that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the system  More recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption  where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks  and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver  or gives it more tasks to do   4 2  Networking  Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols  hardware  and applications for using them  This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing  files  printers  and scanners using either wired or wireless connections  Networks can essentially allow a computer s operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer  This includes everything from simple communication  to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer s graphics or sound hardware  Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently  such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer s command line interface   Client server networking allows a program on a computer  called a client  to connect via a network to another computer  called a server  Servers offer  or host  various services to other network computers and users  These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server s network address  Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program  which is responsible for handling requests to that port  A daemon  being a user program  can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel   Many operating systems support one or more vendor specific or open networking protocols as well  for example  SNA on IBM systems  DECnet on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation  and Microsoft specific protocols  SMB  on Windows  Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as NFS for file access  Protocols like ESound  or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications  on a remote system s sound hardware   4 3  Security  A computer being secure depends on a number of technologies working properly  A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources  which are available to software running on the system  and to external devices like networks via the kernel   The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed  and others which should not be processed  While some systems may simply distinguish between  privileged  and  non privileged   systems commonly have a form of requester identity  such as a user name  To establish identity there may be a process of authentication  Often a username must be quoted  and each username may have a password  Other methods of authentication  such as magnetic cards or biometric data  might be used instead  In some cases  especially connections from the network  resources may be accessed with no authentication at all  such as reading files over a network share   Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization  the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester s user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs   In addition to the allow disallow model of security  a system with a high level of security will also offer auditing options  These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources  such as   who has been reading this file     Internal security  or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the operating system kernel  If programs can directly access hardware and resources  they cannot be secured   External security involves a request from outside the computer  such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network connection  External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system s kernel  where they can be passed onto applications  or carried out directly  Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers  both of a commercial and military nature  The United States Government Department of Defense  DoD  created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria  TCSEC  which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security  This became of vital importance to operating system makers  because the TCSEC was used to evaluate  classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing  storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information   Network services include offerings such as file sharing  print services  email  web sites  and file transfer protocols  FTP   most of which can have compromised security  At the front line of security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection prevention systems  At the operating system level  there are a number of software firewalls available  as well as intrusion detection prevention systems  Most modern operating systems include a software firewall  which is enabled by default  A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system  Therefore  one can install and be running an insecure service  such as Telnet or FTP  and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port   An alternative strategy  and the only sandbox strategy available in systems that do not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements  is where the operating system is not running user programs as native code  but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p code based system such as Java   Internal security is especially relevant for multi user systems  it allows each user of the system to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or read  Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use  since a program can potentially bypass the operating system  inclusive of bypassing auditing   4 4  User interface  Every computer that is to be operated by an individual requires a user interface  The user interface is usually referred to as a shell and is essential if human interaction is to be supported  The user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices  such as a keyboard  mouse or credit card reader  and requests operating system services to display prompts  status messages and such on output hardware devices  such as a video monitor or printer  The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the command line interface  where computer commands are typed out line by line  and the graphical user interface  where a visual environment  most commonly a WIMP  is present   4 4 1  Graphical user interfaces  Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces  GUI   and often include them  In some computer systems  such as the original implementation of Mac OS  the GUI is integrated into the kernel   While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service  incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions  Other operating systems are modular  separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System  In the 1980s UNIX  VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way  Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way  Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user space  however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4 0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel space  Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel   Many computer operating systems allow the user to install or create any user interface they desire  The X&nbsp Window System in conjunction with GNOME or KDE Plasma Desktop is a commonly found setup on most Unix and Unix like  BSD  Linux  Solaris  systems  A number of Windows shell replacements have been released for Microsoft Windows  which offer alternatives to the included Windows shell  but the shell itself cannot be separated from Windows   Numerous Unix based GUIs have existed over time  most derived from X11  Competition among the various vendors of Unix  HP  IBM  Sun  led to much fragmentation  though an effort to standardize in the 1990s to COSE and CDE failed for various reasons  and were eventually eclipsed by the widespread adoption of GNOME and K Desktop Environment  Prior to free software based toolkits and desktop environments  Motif was the prevalent toolkit desktop combination  and was the basis upon which CDE was developed    Graphical user interfaces evolve over time  For example  Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a new major version of Windows is released  and the Mac OS GUI changed dramatically with the introduction of Mac OS X in 1999   5  Real time operating systems  A real time operating system  RTOS  is an operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines  real time computing   Such applications include some small embedded systems  automobile engine controllers  industrial robots  spacecraft  industrial control  and some large scale computing systems   An early example of a large scale real time operating system was Transaction Processing Facility developed by American Airlines and IBM for the Sabre Airline Reservations System   Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real time operating system such as VxWorks  PikeOS  eCos  QNX  MontaVista Linux and RTLinux  Windows CE is a real time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows  codebase  Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel  EKA2  starting with version 8 0b   Some embedded systems use operating systems such as Palm OS  BSD  and Linux  although such operating systems do not support real time computing   6  Operating system development as a hobby  Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities in which a computing hobbyist may engage  A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system  and has few users and active developers   In some cases  hobby development is in support of a  homebrew  computing device  for example  a simple single board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor  Or  development may be for an architecture already in widespread use  Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts  or may commence by modeling an existing operating system  In either case  the hobbyist is his her own developer  or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests   Examples of a hobby operating system include ReactOS and Syllable   7  Diversity of operating systems and portability  Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system  and sometimes even for specific hardware  When porting the application to run on another OS  the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS  the names of functions  meaning of arguments  etc   requiring the application to be adapted  changed  or otherwise maintained   This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms like Java or Qt  These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their system libraries   Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards  For example  POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs   8  Market share  Source  Gartner  9  See
