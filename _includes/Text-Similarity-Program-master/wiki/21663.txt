Nihilism   or   from the Latin   nothing  is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the negation of one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life  The Greek philosopher and Sophist  Gorgias  ca  485 BCE–380 BCE   is perhaps the first to consider the Nihilistic belief  Most commonly  nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism  which argues that life is without objective meaning  purpose  or intrinsic value  Moral nihilists assert that morality does not inherently exist  and that any established moral values are abstractly contrived  Nihilism can also take epistemological or ontological metaphysical forms  meaning respectively that  in some aspect  knowledge is not possible  or that reality does not actually exist   The term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence that one may develop upon realising there are no necessary norms  rules  or laws  Movements such as Futurism and deconstruction  among others  have been identified by commentators as  nihilistic  at various times in various contexts   Nihilism is also a characteristic that has been ascribed to time periods  for example  Jean Baudrillard and others have called postmodernity a nihilistic epoch  and some Christian theologians and figures of religious authority have asserted that postmodernity and many aspects of modernity represent a rejection of theism  and that such rejection of their theistic doctrine entails nihilism   1  Forms of nihilism  Nihilism has many definitions  and thus can describe philosophical positions that are arguably independent   1 1  Metaphysical nihilism  Metaphysical nihilism is the philosophical theory that there might be no objects at all—that is  that there is a possible world where there are no objects at all—or at least that there might be no concrete objects at all—so that even if every possible world contains some objects  there is at least one that contains only abstract objects   An extreme form of metaphysical nihilism is commonly defined as the belief that nothing exists as a correspondent component of the self efficient world  The American Heritage Medical Dictionary defines one form of nihilism as  an extreme form of skepticism that denies all existence   One way of interpreting such a statement is as follows  it is impossible to distinguish  existence  from  non existence  as there are no objective qualities  and thus a reality  that one state could possess in order to discern between the two  If one cannot discern existence from its negation  then the concept of existence has no meaning  or  in other words  does not  exist  in any meaningful way   Meaning  in this sense is used to argue that since existence has no higher state of reality  which is arguably its necessary and defining quality  existence itself means nothing  It could be argued that this belief  once combined with epistemological nihilism  leaves one with an all encompassing nihilism in which nothing can be said to be real or true as such values do not exist  A similar position can be found in solipsism  however  in this viewpoint the solipsist affirms whereas the nihilist would deny the self  Both these positions are forms of anti realism   1 2  Epistemological nihilism  Nihilism of an epistemological form can be seen as an extreme form of skepticism in which all knowledge is denied   1 3  Mereological nihilism  Mereological nihilism  also called compositional nihilism  is the position that objects with proper parts do not exist  not only objects in space  but also objects existing in time do not have any temporal parts   and only basic building blocks without parts exist  and thus the world we see and experience full of objects with parts is a product of human misperception  i e   if we could see clearly  we would not perceive compositive objects    This interpretation of existence must be based on resolution  The resolution with which humans see and perceive the  improper parts  of the world is not an objective fact of reality  but is rather an implicit trait that can only be qualitatively explored and expressed  Therefore there is no arguable way to surmise or measure the validity of mereological nihilism  Example  An ant can get lost on a large cylindrical object because the circumference of the object is so large with respect to the ant that the ant effectively feels as though the object has no curvature  Thus  the resolution with which the ant views the world it exists  within  is a very important determining factor in how the ant experiences this  within the world  feeling  We humans once believed the world was likely flat and planar   1 4  Existential nihilism  Existential nihilism is the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value  With respect to the universe  existential nihilism posits that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant  without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence  The meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism   1 5  Moral nihilism  Moral nihilism  also known as ethical nihilism  is the meta ethical view that morality does not exist as something inherent to objective reality  therefore no action is necessarily preferable to any other  For example  a moral nihilist would say that killing someone  for whatever reason  is not inherently right or wrong   Other nihilists may argue not that there is no morality at all  but that if it does exist  it is a human construction and thus artificial  wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes  As an example  if someone kills someone else  such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing  or bad independently from our moral beliefs  because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy  What is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good  as a result  killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live  which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting  In this way a moral nihilist believes that all moral claims are void of any truth value  An alternative scholarly perspective is that moral nihilism is a morality in itself  Cooper writes   In the widest sense of the word  morality   moral nihilism is a morality    1 6  Political nihilism  Political nihilism  a branch of nihilism  follows the characteristic nihilist s rejection of non rationalized or non proven assertions  in this case the necessity of the most fundamental social and political structures  such as government  family  and law  An influential analysis of political nihilism is presented by Leo Strauss   1 6 1  Russian nihilist movement  The Russian Nihilist movement was a Russian movement in the 1860s that rejected all authority  It is derived from the Latin nihil  meaning  nothing   After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881  the Nihilists were known throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence for political change  The Nihilists were angered by what they described as the abusive nature of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the tsarist monarchy  and by the domination of the economy by the aristocracy  Although the term Nihilist was first used by the German theologian Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi  its widespread usage began with the 1862 novel Fathers and Sons by the Russian author Ivan Turgenev  The main character of the novel  Eugene Bazarov  who describes himself as a Nihilist  wants to educate the people  This  go to the peoplebe the people  campaign reached its height in the 1870s  during which underground groups such as Circle of Tchaikovsky  People s Will  and Land and Liberty formed  This became known as the Narodnik movement  whose members believed that the newly freed serfs were merely being sold into wage slavery in the onset of the Industrial Revolution  and that the middle and upper classes had effectively replaced landowners  The Russian state attempted to suppress them  In actions described by the Nihilists as propaganda of the deed many government officials were assassinated  In 1881 Alexander II was killed on the very day he had approved a proposal to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms   2  History  2 1  19th century  The term nihilism was first used by Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi  1743–1819   Jacobi used the term to characterize rationalism and in particular Immanuel Kant s  critical  philosophy to carry out a reductio ad absurdum according to which all rationalism  philosophy as criticism  reduces to nihilism—and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of faith and revelation  Bret W  Davis writes  for example   The first philosophical development of the idea of nihilism is generally ascribed to Friedrich Jacobi  who in a famous letter criticized Fichte s idealism as falling into nihilism  According to Jacobi  Fichte’s absolutization of the ego  the  absolute I  that posits the  not I   is an inflation of subjectivity that denies the absolute transcendence of God   A related but oppositional concept is fideism  which sees reason as hostile and inferior to faith   With the popularizing of the word nihilism by Ivan Turgenev  a new Russian political movement called the Nihilist movement adopted the term  They supposedly called themselves nihilists because nothing  that then existed found favor in their eyes    2 2  Kierkegaard  Søren Kierkegaard  1813–1855  posited an early form of nihilism  to which he referred as levelling  He saw levelling as the process of suppressing individuality to a point where the individual s uniqueness becomes non existent and nothing meaningful in his existence can be affirmed   Kierkegaard  an advocate of a philosophy of life  generally argued against levelling and its nihilist consequence  although he believed it would be  genuinely educative to live in the age of levelling  because  people will be forced to face the judgement of  levelling  alone   George Cotkin asserts Kierkegaard was against  the standardization and levelling of belief  both spiritual and political  in the nineteenth century  and he  opposed tendencies in mass culture to reduce the individual to a cipher of conformity and deference to the dominant opinion   In his day  tabloids  like the Danish magazine Corsaren  and apostate Christianity were instruments of levelling and contributed to the  reflective apathetic age  of 19th century Europe  Kierkegaard argues that individuals who can overcome the levelling process are stronger for it and that it represents a step in the right direction towards  becoming a true self   As we must overcome levelling  Hubert Dreyfus and Jane Rubin argue that Kierkegaard s interest   in an increasingly nihilistic age  is in how we can recover the sense that our lives are meaningful    Note however that Kierkegaard s meaning of  nihilism  differs from the modern definition in the sense that  for Kierkegaard  levelling led to a life lacking meaning  purpose or value  whereas the modern interpretation of nihilism posits that there was never any meaning  purpose or value to begin with   2 3  Nietzsche  Nihilism is often associated with the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche  who provided a detailed diagnosis of nihilism as a widespread phenomenon of Western culture  Though the notion appears frequently throughout Nietzsche s work  he uses the term in a variety of ways  with different meanings and connotations  all negative  Karen Carr describes Nietzsche s characterization of nihilism  as a condition of tension  as a disproportion between what we want to value  or need  and how the world appears to operate   When we find out that the world does not possess the objective value or meaning that we want it to have or have long since believed it to have  we find ourselves in a crisis  Nietzsche asserts that with the decline of Christianity and the rise of physiological decadence  nihilism is in fact characteristic of the modern age  though he implies that the rise of nihilism is still incomplete and that it has yet to be overcome  Though the problem of nihilism becomes especially explicit in Nietzsche s notebooks  published posthumously   it is mentioned repeatedly in his published works and is closely connected to many of the problems mentioned there   Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning  purpose  comprehensible truth  or essential value  This observation stems in part from Nietzsche s perspectivism  or his notion that  knowledge  is always by someone of some thing  it is always bound by perspective  and it is never mere fact  Rather  there are interpretations through which we understand the world and give it meaning  Interpreting is something we can not go without  in fact  it is something we need  One way of interpreting the world is through morality  as one of the fundamental ways that people make sense of the world  especially in regard to their own thoughts and actions  Nietzsche distinguishes a morality that is strong or healthy  meaning that the person in question is aware that he constructs it himself  from weak morality  where the interpretation is projected on to something external  Regardless of its strength  morality presents us with meaning  whether this is created or  implanted   which helps us get through life   Nietzsche discusses Christianity  one of the major topics in his work  at length in the context of the problem of nihilism in his notebooks  in a chapter entitled  European Nihilism   Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value  belief in God  which justifies the evil in the world  and a basis for objective knowledge  In this sense  in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible  Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism  against the despair of meaninglessness  However  it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing  in its drive towards truth  Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct  which leads to its own dissolution  It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity  not because we lived too far from it  rather because we lived too close   As such  the self dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism  Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as the interpretation  Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond skepticism to a distrust of all meaning   Stanley Rosen identifies Nietzsche s concept of nihilism with a situation of meaninglessness  in which  everything is permitted   According to him  the loss of higher metaphysical values that exist in contrast to the base reality of the world  or merely human ideas  give rise to the idea that all human ideas are therefore valueless  Rejecting idealism thus results in nihilism  because only similarly transcendent ideals live up to the previous standards that the nihilist still implicitly holds  The inability for Christianity to serve as a source of valuating the world is reflected in Nietzsche s famous aphorism of the madman in The Gay Science  The death of God  in particular the statement that  we killed him   is similar to the self dissolution of Christian doctrine  due to the advances of the sciences  which for Nietzsche show that man is the product of evolution  that Earth has no special place among the stars and that history is not progressive  the Christian notion of God can no longer serve as a basis for a morality   One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls passive nihilism  which he recognises in the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer  Schopenhauer s doctrine  which Nietzsche also refers to as Western Buddhism  advocates a separating of oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering  Nietzsche characterises this ascetic attitude as a  will to nothingness   whereby life turns away from itself  as there is nothing of value to be found in the world  This mowing away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist  although in this  the nihilist appears inconsistent   Nietzsche s relation to the problem of nihilism is a complex one  He approaches the problem of nihilism as deeply personal  stating that this predicament of the modern world is a problem that has  become conscious  in him  Furthermore  he emphasises both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers  as seen in his statement that  I praise  I do not reproach   nihilism s  arrival  I believe it is one of the greatest crises  a moment of the deepest self reflection of humanity  Whether man recovers from it  whether he becomes master of this crisis  is a question of his strength   According to Nietzsche  it is only when nihilism is overcome that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive  He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure   He states that there is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity s self dissolution  one that does not stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness  This alternate   active  nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new  This form of nihilism is characterized by Nietzsche as  a sign of strength   a wilful destruction of the old values to wipe the slate clean and lay down one s own beliefs and interpretations  contrary to the passive nihilism that resigns itself with the decomposition of the old values  This wilful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning  this active nihilism  could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a  free spirit  or the Übermensch from Thus Spoke Zarathustra and The Antichrist  the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives his life as if it were his own work of art  It may be questioned  though  whether  active nihilism  is indeed the correct term for this stance  and some question whether Nietzsche takes the problems nihilism poses seriously enough   2 4  Heidegger s interpretation of Nietzsche  Martin Heidegger s interpretation of Nietzsche influenced many postmodern thinkers who investigated the problem of nihilism as put forward by Nietzsche  Only recently has Heidegger s influence on Nietzschean nihilism research faded  As early as the 1930s  Heidegger was giving lectures on Nietzsche’s thought  Given the importance of Nietzsche’s contribution to the topic of nihilism  Heidegger s influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important for the historical development of the term nihilism   Heidegger s method of researching and teaching Nietzsche is explicitly his own  He does not specifically try to present Nietzsche as Nietzsche  He rather tries to incorporate Nietzsche s thoughts into his own philosophical system of Being  Time and Dasein  In his Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being  1944–46   Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche’s nihilism as trying to achieve a victory through the devaluation of the  until then  highest values  The principle of this devaluation is  according to Heidegger  the Will to Power  The Will to Power is also the principle of every earlier valuation of values  How does this devaluation occur and why is this nihilistic  One of Heidegger s main critiques on philosophy is that philosophy  and more specifically metaphysics  has forgotten to discriminate between investigating the notion of a Being  Seiende  and Being  Sein   According to Heidegger  the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of metaphysics  And because metaphysics has forgotten to ask about the notion of Being  what Heidegger calls Seinsvergessenheit   it is a history about the destruction of Being  That is why Heidegger calls metaphysics nihilistic  This makes Nietzsche’s metaphysics not a victory over nihilism  but a perfection of it   Heidegger  in his interpretation of Nietzsche  has been inspired by Ernst Jünger  Many references to Jünger can be found in Heidegger s lectures on Nietzsche  For example  in a letter to the rector of Freiburg University of November 4  1945  Heidegger  inspired by Jünger  tries to explain the notion of “God is dead” as the “reality of the Will to Power ” Heidegger also praises Jünger for defending Nietzsche against a too biological or anthropological reading during the Third Reich   Heidegger s interpretation of Nietzsche influenced a number of important postmodernist thinkers  Gianni Vattimo points at a back and forth movement in European thought  between Nietzsche and Heidegger  During the 1960s  a Nietzschean  renaissance  began  culminating in the work of Mazzino Montinari and Giorgio Colli  They began work on a new and complete edition of Nietzsche s collected works  making Nietzsche more accessible for scholarly research  Vattimo explains that with this new edition of Colli and Montinari  a critical reception of Heidegger s interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape  Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers  Vattimo does not want  or only partially wants  to rely on Heidegger for understanding Nietzsche  On the other hand  Vattimo judges Heidegger s intentions authentic enough to keep pursuing them  Philosophers who Vattimo exemplifies as a part of this back and forth movement are French philosophers Deleuze  Foucault and Derrida  Italian philosophers of this same movement are Cacciari  Severino and himself  Habermas  Lyotard and Rorty are also philosophers who are influenced by Heidegger s interpretation of Nietzsche   2 5  Postmodernism  Postmodern and poststructuralist thought question the very grounds on which Western cultures have based their  truths   absolute knowledge and meaning  a  decentralization  of authorship  the accumulation of positive knowledge  historical progress  and certain ideals and practices of humanism and the Enlightenment   Jacques Derrida  whose deconstruction is perhaps most commonly labeled nihilistic  did not himself make the nihilistic move that others have claimed  Derridean deconstructionists argue that this approach rather frees texts  individuals or organizations from a restrictive truth  and that deconstruction opens up the possibility of other ways of being  Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak  for example  uses deconstruction to create an ethics of opening up Western scholarship to the voice of the subaltern and to philosophies outside of the canon of western texts  Derrida himself built a philosophy based upon a  responsibility to the other   Deconstruction can thus be seen not as a denial of truth  but as a denial of our ability to know truth  it makes an epistemological claim compared to nihilism s ontological claim    Lyotard argues that  rather than relying on an objective truth or method to prove their claims  philosophers legitimize their truths by reference to a story about the world that can t be separated from the age and system the stories belong to—referred to by Lyotard as meta narratives  He then goes on to define the postmodern condition as characterized by a rejection both of these meta narratives and of the process of legitimation by meta narratives   In lieu of meta narratives we have created new language games in order to legitimize our claims which rely on changing relationships and mutable truths  none of which is privileged over the other to speak to ultimate truth   This concept of the instability of truth and meaning leads in the direction of nihilism  though Lyotard stops short of embracing the latter   Postmodern theorist Jean Baudrillard wrote briefly of nihilism from the postmodern viewpoint in Simulacra and Simulation  He stuck mainly to topics of interpretations of the real world over the simulations of which the real world is composed  The uses of meaning was an important subject in Baudrillard s discussion of nihilism   2 6  Transcendental nihilism   methodological naturalism  In Nihil Unbound  Extinction and Enlightenment  Ray Brassier maintains that philosophy has avoided the traumatic idea of extinction  instead attempting to find meaning in a world conditioned by the very idea of its own annihilation  Thus Brassier critiques both the phenomenological and hermeneutic strands of Continental philosophy as well as the vitality of thinkers like Gilles Deleuze  who work to ingrain meaning in the world and stave off the “threat” of nihilism  Instead  drawing on thinkers such as Alain Badiou  François Laruelle  Paul Churchland  and Thomas Metzinger  Brassier defends a view of the world as inherently devoid of meaning  That is  rather than avoiding nihilism  Brassier embraces it as the truth of reality  Brassier concludes from his readings of Badiou and Laruelle that the universe is founded on the nothing  but also that philosophy is the  organon of extinction   that it is only because life is conditioned by its own extinction that there is thought at all  Brassier then defends a radically anti correlationist philosophy proposing that Thought is conjoined not with Being  but with Non Being   3  Nihilism and culture  3 1  Dada  The term Dada was first used by Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara in 1916  The movement  which lasted from approximately 1916 to 1922  arose during World War I  an event that influenced the artists  The Dada Movement began in Zürich  Switzerland – known as the  Niederdorf  or  Niederdörfli  – in the Café Voltaire  The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art movement  but an anti art movement  sometimes using found objects in a manner similar to found poetry  The  anti art  drive is thought to have stemmed from a post war emptiness  This tendency toward devaluation of art has led many to claim that Dada was an essentially nihilistic movement  Given that Dada created its own means for interpreting its products  it is difficult to classify alongside most other contemporary art expressions  Hence  due to its ambiguity  it is sometimes classified as a nihilistic modus vivendi   3 2  Literature  The term  nihilism  was actually popularized by Ivan Turgenev in his novel Fathers and Sons  whose hero  Bazarov  was a nihilist and recruited several followers to the philosophy  He found his nihilistic ways challenged upon falling in love   Anton Chekhov portrayed nihilism when writing Three Sisters  The phrase  what does it matter  or such variants is often spoken by several characters in response to events  the significance of some of these events suggests a subscription to nihilism by said characters as a type of coping strategy   In the graphic novel Watchmen  the character The Comedian Edward Blake is characterized as being a nihilist  both moral and political  to the extent of openly committing murder in order to demonstrate the lack of human concern or nerve  stating that Dr  Manhattan could have stopped him at any moment  but chose not to   Dr  Manhattan is also portrayed as a nihilist on the cosmic scale by stating if the Earth was destroyed and all life on it eradicated  the universe would not notice   The comic book supervillain The Joker has been portrayed as both an anarchist and a nihilist  typically by condemning life as a meaningless  harsh joke  Living through such a life to him is  crazy   while the insane ones are truly the normal people  In Batman #663  The Clown At Midnight  the Joker says  The real joke is your stubborn  bone deep conviction that somehow  somewhere  all of this makes sense  That s what cracks me up each time   and during The Killing Joke he goes as far to call everyone s ideals and struggles in life a  monstrous  demented gag    In the manga graphic novel series Bleach The Espada Ullquiorra Cifer s aspect of death is Nihilism   Ayn Rand vehemently denounced nihilism as an abdication of rationality and the pursuit of happiness which she regarded as life s moral purpose  As such  most villains are depicted as moral nihilists including Ellsworth Monckton Toohey in The Fountainhead who is a self aware nihilist and the corrupt government in Atlas Shrugged who are unconsciously driven by nihilism which has taken root in the books depiction of American society with the fictional slang phrase  Who is John Galt   being used as a defeatist way of saying  Who knows   or  What does it matter   by characters in the book who have essentially given up on life   The philosophical ideas of the French author  the Marquis De Sade  are often noted as early examples of nihilistic principles   3 3  Music  In Act III of Shostakovich s opera  Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District   a nihilist is tormented by the Russian police  A 2007 article in The Guardian noted that     in the summer of 1977     punk s nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England   The Sex Pistols  God Save The Queen  with its chant like refrain of  no future   became a slogan for unemployed and disaffected youth during the late 1970s  Their song Pretty Vacant is also a prime example of the band s nihilistic outlook  Other influential punk rock and proto punk bands to adopt nihilistic themes include The Velvet Underground  The Stooges  Misfits  Ramones  Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers  Richard Hell and the Voidoids  Suicide and Black Flag   Black metal  death metal  and doom metal music often emphasize nihilistic themes  Explorers of nihilistic themes in heavy metal include Black Sabbath  Metallica  Slayer  Ozzy Osbourne  Opeth  Alice in Chains  Godflesh  Celtic Frost  Ministry  Autopsy  Dismember  Motörhead  Bathory  Darkthrone  Emperor  Tool  Meshuggah  Candlemass  Morbid Saint  Kreator  Morbid Angel  Sepultura  Exodus  Entombed  Death  Mayhem  Nevermore  Dark Angel  Dissection  Weakling  Obituary  Electric Wizard  Eyehategod  Pantera  Sleep and At the Gates   Elliott Smith expressed nihilistic views in  Ballad of Big Nothing   as did The Beatles in  Nowhere Man    The Nine Inch Nails album The Downward Spiral has several nihilistic themes and concepts throughout the overall storyline  with the narrator rejecting the world and the concept of God and attempting to forge his own versions  with lines such as  God is dead  And no one cares  If there is a Hell  I ll see you there    although other lines such as  you get me Closer to God   suggest the narrator finds meaning and faith once more through his sexuality   The album  Antichrist Superstar  by Marilyn Manson is highly nihilistic and inspired  in part  by the philosophy of Nietzsche  Lyrics like the ones in the song  1996  show a heavy influence of nihilism  and  The Reflecting God  has some seemingly existential nihilstic lyrics    Nihilism  is also the name of a song released by the band Rancid in their 1994 album Let s Go   3 4  Film  The character John Morlar from Peter Van Greenaway s 1973 novel The Medusa Touch and the 1978 film version holds nihilistic beliefs as does the character Animal Mother from Stanley Kubrick s 1987 film Full Metal Jacket and the ruthless thug O Dog from the 1993 film Menace II Society by the Hughes Brothers   Three of the antagonists in the 1998 movie The Big Lebowski are explicitly described as  nihilists   but are not shown exhibiting any explicitly nihilistic traits during the film  Regarding the nihilists  the character Walter Sobchak comments  Nihilists  Fuck me  I mean  say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism  Dude  at least it s an ethos   The 1999 film The Matrix portrays the character Thomas A  Anderson with a hollowed out copy of Baudrillard s treatise  Simulacra and Simulation  in which he stores contraband data files under the chapter  On Nihilism   The main antagonist Agent Smith is also depicted frequently as a nihilist  with him ranting about how all of peace  justice and love were meaningless in The Matrix Revolutions  The 1999 film Fight Club also features concepts relating to Nihilism by exploring the contrasts between the artificial values imposed by consumerism in relation to the more meaningful pursuit of spiritual happiness   Owlman  the alternate universe Batman from the 2010 film Justice League  Crisis on Two Earths shows nihilistic traits  culminating in his desire to eliminate  Earth Prime   the universe from which all universes sprang  Ultimately thwarted by Batman and left on a wasteland earth with his nuclear device  Owlman chooses neither to save himself nor stop the bomb  simply stating that  it doesn t matter    In keeping with his comic book depiction  The Joker is portrayed as a nihilist in The Dark Knight  describing himself as  an Agent of Chaos  and at one point burning a gigantic pile of money stating that crime is  not about money  it s about sending a message  everything burns   Alfred Pennyworth states  regarding the Joker  Some men aren t looking for anything logical  like money   they can t be bought  bullied  reasoned or negotiated with   some men just want to watch the world burn    In Demetrius and the Gladiators  the titular character is a Christian who loses his faith  sinking into depression and nihilism after watching the apparent murder of the woman he loves however she is later proven to be alive and in keeping with the film s religious message  he regains his faith before the film s climax   3 5  Video Games  The Final Fantasy VI main villain Kefka Palazzo was depicted late into the game as a nihilist  viewing life and creation as being utterly meaningless  and eventually deciding to destroy the bonds of existence largely for this reason   The character from Star Wars  Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords  a dark lord named Darth Nihilus was a reference to the Nihilism ideology as he devour entire planets and did not care for living things at all   The character Monsoon from Metal Gear Rising  Revengeance was depicted as being nihilistic in his outlook  which is strongly implied to be the result of being a survivor and victim of the Khmer Rouge s rule over Cambodia as a child   4  See also  5  Notes  6  References    Primary texts  Jacobi  Friedrich Heinrich  Jacobi an Fichte  1799
