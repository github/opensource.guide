Ur  Sumerian  Urim  Sumerian Cuneiform  or   Akkadian  Uru    was an important Sumerian city state in ancient Mesopotamia  located at the site of modern Tell el Muqayyar    in south Iraq s Dhi Qar Governorate  Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf  the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland  south of the Euphrates on its right bank  16 kilometres  9 9 mi  from Nasiriyah   The city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800 BC  and is recorded in written history as a City State from the 26th century BC  its first recorded king being Mesh Ane pada  The city s patron deity was Nanna  in Akkadian  Sin   the Sumerian and Akkadian  Assyrian Babylonian  moon god  and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god s name  being the classical Sumerian spelling of LAK 32 UNUGKI  literally  the abode  UNUG  of Nanna  LAK 32     The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur  which contained the shrine of Nanna  excavated in the 1930s  The temple was built in the 21st century BC  short chronology   during the reign of Ur Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus  the Assyrian born last king of Babylon  The ruins cover an area of northwest to southeast by northeast to southwest and rise up to about above the present plain level   1  History  1 1  Prehistory  Archaeologists have discovered the evidence of an early occupation at Ur during the Ubaid period  ca  6500 to 3800 BC   These early levels were sealed off with a sterile deposit of soil that was interpreted by excavators of the 1920s as evidence for the Great Flood of the book of Genesis and Epic of Gilgamesh  It is now understood that the South Mesopotamian plain was exposed to regular floods from the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers  with heavy erosion from water and wind  which may have given rise to the Mesopotamian and derivative Biblical Great Flood stories  The further occupation of Ur only becomes clear during its emergence in the third millennium BC  although it must already have been a growing urban center during the fourth millennium   The third millennium BC is generally described as the Early Bronze Age of Mesopotamia  which ends approximately after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur in the 21st   1 2  Third millennium BC  Early Bronze Age   There are two main sources which inform scholars about the importance of Ur during the Early Bronze Age  The first is a large body of cuneiform documents  mostly from the empire of the so called Third Dynasty of Ur  at the very end of the third millennium  This was the most centralized bureaucratic state the world had yet known  Concerning the earlier centuries  the Sumerian King List provides a tentative political history of ancient Sumer   The second source of information is archaeological work in modern Iraq  Although the early centuries  first half of the third millennium and earlier  are still poorly understood  the archaeological discoveries have shown unequivocally that Ur was a major urban center on the Mesopotamian plain  Especially the discovery of the Royal Tombs have confirmed its splendour  These tombs  which date to the Early Dynastic IIIa period  approximately in the 25th or 24th century BC   contained immense amounts of luxury items made out of precious metals  and semi precious stones  all of which would have required importation from long distances  Iran  Afghanistan  India  Asia Minor  the Persian Gulf   This wealth  unparalleled up to then  is a testimony of Ur s economic importance during the Early Bronze Age   Archaeological research of the region has also contributed greatly to our understanding of the landscape and long distance interactions that took place during these ancient times  We know that Ur was the most important port on the Persian Gulf  which extended much further inland than it does today  All the wealth which came to Mesopotamia by sea had to pass through Ur   So far evidence for the earliest periods of the Early Bronze Age in Mesopotamia is very limited  Mesh Ane pada is the first king mentioned in the Sumerian King List  and appears to have lived in the 26th century BC  That Ur was an important urban centre already then seems to be indicated by a type of cylinder seal called the City Seals  These seals contain a set of proto cuneiform signs which appear to be writings or symbols of the name of city states in ancient Sumer  Many of these seals have been found in Ur  and the name of Ur is prominent on them   Ur came under the control of the Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC  This was a period when the Semitic Akkadians of Mesopotamia gained ascendancy over the Sumerians  and indeed much of the ancient Near East   After the fall of the Akkadian Empire in the mid 22nd century BC  southern Mesopotamia came to be ruled for a few decades by the Gutians  a barbarian people originating in the Zagros Mountains to the north east of Mesopotamia  while the Assyrian branch of the Akkadian Semites reasserted their independence in the north of Mesopotamia   The third dynasty was established when the king Ur Nammu came to power  ruling between ca  2047 BC and 2030 BC  During his rule  temples  including the ziggurat  were built  and agriculture was improved through irrigation  His code of laws  the Code of Ur Nammu  a fragment was identified in Istanbul in 1952  is one of the oldest such documents known  preceding the Code of Hammurabi by 300 years  He and his successor Shulgi were both deified during their reigns  and after his death he continued as a hero figure  one of the surviving works of Sumerian literature describes the death of Ur Nammu and his journey to the underworld  About that time  the houses in the city were two storied villas with 13 or 14 rooms  with plastered interior walls   Ur Nammu was succeeded by Shulgi  the greatest king of the Third Dynasty of Ur  who solidified the hegemony of Ur and reformed the empire into a highly centralized bureaucratic state  Shulgi ruled for a long time  at least 42 years  and deified himself halfway through his rule   The Ur empire continued through the reigns of three more kings with Semitic Akkadian names  Amar Sin  Shu Sin  and Ibbi Sin  It fell around 1940 BC to the Elamites in the 24th regnal year of Ibbi Sin  an event commemorated by the Lament for Ur   According to one estimate  Ur was the largest city in the world from c  2030 to 1980 BC  Its population was approximately 65 000   2011 research indicates that the area was struck by drought conditions from 2200 to 2000 BC  The population dropped by 93%  Ur was sacked twice by nomads during this time  At the end of this drought  the use of the Sumerian language died out   1 3  Later Bronze Age  The city of Ur lost its political power after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur  Nevertheless its important position which kept on providing access to the Persian Gulf ensured the ongoing economic importance of the city during the second millennium BC  The splendour of the city  the might of the empire  the greatness of king Shulgi  and undoubtedly the efficient propaganda of the state endured throughout Mesopotamian history  Shulgi was a well known historical figure for at least another two thousand years  while historical narratives of the Mesopotamian societies of Assyria and Babylonia kept names  events  and mythologies in remembrance  The city came to be ruled by the first dynasty  Amorite  of Babylonia which rose to prominence in southern Mesopotamia in the 18th century BC  After the fall of Hammurabi s short lived Babylonian Empire  it later became a part of the native Akkadian ruled Sealand Dynasty for over 270 years  and was reconquered into Babylonia by the successors of the Amorites  the Kassites in the 16th century BC  During the Kassite Dynastic period Ur  along with the rest of Babylonia  came under sporadic control of the Elamites and Middle Assyrian Empire   1 4  Iron Age  The city  along with the rest of southern Mesopotamia and much of the Near East  Asia Minor  North Africa and southern Caucasus  fell to the north Mesopotamian Assyrian Empire from the 10th to late 7th centuries BC  From the end of the 7th century BC Ur was ruled by the so called Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon  In the 6th century BC there was new construction in Ur under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon  The last Babylonian king  Nabonidus  who was Assyrian born  and not a Chaldean   improved the ziggurat  However the city started to decline from around 550 BC and was no longer inhabited after about 500 BC by which time Babylonia had fallen to the Persian Achaemenid Empire  The demise of Ur was perhaps owing to drought  changing river patterns  and the silting of the outlet to the Persian Gulf   2  Biblical Ur  Ur is considered by many to be the city of Ur Kasdim mentioned in the Book of Genesis  Biblical Hebrew   as the birthplace of the Hebrew patriarch Abram  Abraham  Aramaic  Oraham  Arabic  Ibrahim   traditionally believed to be some time in the 2nd millennium BC   Ur is mentioned four times in the Torah or Old Testament  with the distinction  of the Kasdim Kasdin —traditionally rendered in English as  Ur of the Chaldees   The Chaldeans were already settled in the vicinity by around 850 BC  but were not the rulers of Ur until the late 7th century BC  The name is found in     and   In Nehemiah 9 7  a single passage mentioning Ur is a paraphrase of Genesis      The Book of Jubilees states that Ur was founded in 1688 Anno Mundi  year of the world  by  Ur son of Kesed  presumably the offspring of Arphaxad  adding that in this same year wars began on Earth   2 1  Ur in Islamic tradition  According to Islamic texts  the prophet Ibrahim  Abraham  was thrown into the fire here  In the story  the temperature of the fire of Nimrod was reduced by God  saving the life of Ibrahim  While the Qur an does not mention the king s name  Muslim commentators have assigned Nimrod as the king based on Jewish sources  namely the Book of Jasher  11 1 and 12 6    3  Archaeology  In 1625  the site was visited by Pietro della Valle  who recorded the presence of ancient bricks stamped with strange symbols  cemented together with bitumen  as well as inscribed pieces of black marble that appeared to be seals   The site was first excavated in 1853 and 1854 by John George Taylor  British vice consul at Basra from 1851 to 1859  He worked on behalf of the British Museum  He had been instructed to do so by the Foreign Office  Taylor found clay cylinders in the four corners of the top stage of the ziggurat which bore an inscription of Nabonidus  Nabuna`id   the last king of Babylon  539 BC   closing with a prayer for his son Belshar uzur  Bel ŝarra Uzur   the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel  Evidence was found of prior restorations of the ziggurat by Ishme Dagan of Isin and Shu Sin of Ur  and by Kurigalzu  a Kassite king of Babylon in the 14th century BC  Nebuchadnezzar also claims to have rebuilt the temple  Taylor further excavated an interesting Babylonian building  not far from the temple  part of an ancient Babylonian necropolis  All about the city he found abundant remains of burials of later periods  Apparently  in later times  owing to its sanctity  Ur became a favorite place of sepulchres  so that even after it had ceased to be inhabited  it continued to be used as a necropolis   Typical of the era  his excavations destroyed information and exposed the tell  Natives used the now loosened  4000 year old bricks and tile for construction for the next 75 years  while the site lay unexplored   After Taylor s time  the site was visited by numerous travelers  almost all of whom have found ancient Babylonian remains  inscribed stones and the like  lying upon the surface  The site was considered rich in remains  and relatively easy to explore  After some soundings were made in 1918 by Reginald Campbell Thompson  H  R  Hill worked the site for one season for the British Museum in 1919  laying the groundwork for more extensive efforts to follow   Excavations from 1922 to 1934 were funded by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania and led by the archaeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley  A total of about 1 850 burials were uncovered  including 16 that were described as  royal tombs  containing many valuable artifacts  including the Standard of Ur  Most of the royal tombs were dated to about 2600 BC  The finds included the unlooted tomb of a queen thought to be Queen Puabi—the name is known from a cylinder seal found in the tomb  although there were two other different and unnamed seals found in the tomb  Many other people had been buried with her  in a form of human sacrifice  Near the ziggurat were uncovered the temple E nun mah and buildings E dub lal mah  built for a king   E gi par  residence of the high priestess  and E hur sag  a temple building   Outside the temple area  many houses used in everyday life were found  Excavations were also made below the royal tombs layer  a layer of alluvial clay covered the remains of earlier habitation  including pottery from the Ubaid period  the first stage of settlement in southern Mesopotamia  Woolley later wrote many articles and books about the discoveries  One of Woolley s assistants on the site was the archaeologist Max Mallowan  The discoveries at the site reached the headlines in mainstream media in the world with the discoveries of the Royal Tombs  As a result the ruins of the ancient city attracted many visitors  One of these visitors was the already famous Agatha Christie  who as a result of this visit became the wife of Max Mallowan   Most of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology  At the Penn Museum the exhibition  Iraq s Ancient Past   which includes many of the most famous pieces from the Royal Tombs  opened to visitors in late Spring 2011  Previously  the Penn Museum had sent many of its best pieces from Ur on tour in an exhibition called  Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur   It traveled to eight American museums  including those in Cleveland  Washington and Dallas  ending the tour at the Detroit Institute of Art in May 2011   In 2009  an agreement was reached for a joint University of Pennsylvania and Iraqi team to resume archaeological work at the site of Ur   3 1  Archaeological remains  Though some of the areas that were cleared during modern excavations have sanded over again  the Great Ziggurat is fully cleared and stands as the best preserved and most visible landmark at the site  The famous Royal tombs  also called the Neo Sumerian Mausolea  located about south east of the Great Ziggurat in the corner of the wall that surrounds the city  are nearly totally cleared  Parts of the tomb area appear to be in need of structural consolidation or stabilization   There are cuneiform  Sumerian writing  on many walls  some entirely covered in script stamped into the mud bricks  The text is sometimes difficult to read  but it covers most surfaces  Modern graffiti has also found its way to the graves  usually in the form of names made with coloured pens  sometimes they are carved   The Great Ziggurat itself has far more graffiti  mostly lightly carved into the bricks  The graves are completely empty  A small number of the tombs are accessible  Most of them have been cordoned off  The whole site is covered with pottery debris  to the extent that it is virtually impossible to set foot anywhere without stepping on some  Some have colours and paintings on them  Some of the  mountains  of broken pottery are debris that has been removed from excavations  Pottery debris and human remains form many of the walls of the royal tombs area  It can only be speculated whether this is of ancient making or modern restoration  but it is a fact that they are  literally  filled up with pottery debris   In May 2009  the United States Army returned the Ur site to the Iraqi authorities  who hope to develop it as a tourist destination   3 2  Preservation  Since 2009  the non profit organization  Global Heritage Fund  GHF   has been working to protect and preserve Ur against the problems of erosion  neglect  inappropriate restoration  and war and conflict  GHF s stated goal for the project is to create an informed and scientifically grounded Master Plan to guide the long term conservation and management of the site  and to serve as a model for the stewardship of other sites   Since 2013  the institution for Development Cooperation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs   and the SBAH  the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage of the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities  have started a cooperation project for  The Conservation and Maintenance of Archaeological site of UR   In the framework of this cooperation agreement  the executive plan  with detailed drawings  are in progress for the maintenance of the Dublamah Temple  design concluded  works starting   the Royal Tombs  Mausolea 3rd Dynasty   in progress  and the Ziqqurat  in progress   The first updated survey in 2013 has produced a new aerial map derived by the flight of a UAV  Unmanned Aerial Veichle  operated in March 2014  This is the first high resolution map  derived from more than 100 aerial photograms  with an accuracy of 20 cm or less  A preview of the ORTHO PHOTOMAP of Archaeological Site of UR is available    4  See also  5  Data  6  Notes  7  References  Pardo Mata  Pilar   Ur  ciudad de los sumerios
