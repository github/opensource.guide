Adeline Virginia Woolf    née Stephen  25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941  was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century   During the interwar period  Woolf was a significant figure in London literary society and a central figure in the influential Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals  Her most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway  1925   To the Lighthouse  1927  and Orlando  1928   and the book length essay A Room of One s Own  1929   with its famous dictum   A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction   Woolf suffered from severe bouts of mental illness throughout her life  thought to have been the result of what is now termed bipolar disorder  and committed suicide by drowning in 1941 at the age of 59   1  Early life  Virginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen at 22 Hyde Park Gate in London  Her parents were Sir Leslie Stephen  1832–1904  and  née Jackson  1846–1895   Leslie Stephen was a notable historian  author  critic and mountaineer  He was a founding editor of the Dictionary of National Biography  a work which would influence Woolf s later experimental biographies  Julia Stephen was a renowned beauty  born in British India to Dr  John and Maria Pattle Jackson  She was also the niece of the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and first cousin of the temperance leader Lady Henry Somerset  Julia moved to England with her mother  where she served as a model for Pre Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne Jones   Woolf was educated by her parents in their literate and well connected household at 22 Hyde Park Gate  Kensington  Her parents had each been married previously and been widowed  and  consequently  the household contained the children of three marriages  Julia had three children by her first husband  Herbert Duckworth  George  Stella  and Gerald Duckworth  Leslie had first married Harriet Marian  Minny  Thackeray  1840–1875   the daughter of William Thackeray  and they had one daughter  Laura Makepeace Stephen  who was declared mentally disabled and lived with the family until she was institutionalised in 1891  Leslie and Julia had four children together  Vanessa Stephen  1879   Thoby Stephen  1880   Virginia  1882   and Adrian Stephen  1883    Sir Leslie Stephen s eminence as an editor  critic  and biographer  and his connection to William Thackeray  meant that his children were raised in an environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society  Henry James  George Henry Lewes  and Virginia s honorary godfather  James Russell Lowell  were among the visitors to the house  Julia Stephen was equally well connected  She came from a family of beauties who left their mark on Victorian society as models for Pre Raphaelite artists and early photographers  including her aunt Julia Margaret Cameron who was also a visitor to the Stephen household  Supplementing these influences was the immense library at the Stephens  house  from which Virginia and Vanessa were taught the classics and English literature  Unlike the girls  their brothers Adrian and Julian  Thoby  were formally educated and sent to Cambridge  a difference that Virginia would resent  The sisters did  however  benefit indirectly from their brothers  Cambridge contacts  as the boys brought their new intellectual friends home to the Stephens  drawing room   According to Woolf s memoirs  her most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of St Ives  Cornwall  where the family spent every summer until 1895  The Stephens  summer home  Talland House  looked out over Porthminster Bay  and is still standing today  though somewhat altered  Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape  especially the Godrevy Lighthouse  informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years  most notably To the Lighthouse   The sudden death of her mother in 1895  when Virginia was 13  and that of her half sister Stella two years later  led to the first of Virginia s several nervous breakdowns  She was  however  able to take courses of study  some at degree level  in Greek  Latin  German and history at the Ladies  Department of King s College London between 1897 and 1901  and this brought her into contact with some of the early reformers of women s higher education such as Clara Pater  George Warr and Lilian Faithfull  Principal of the King s Ladies  Department and noted as one of the Steamboat ladies   Her sister Vanessa also studied Latin  Italian  art and architecture at King s Ladies  Department  On 2 May 2013  it was announced that Woolf was to be honoured by her alma mater when  in autumn 2013  the Virginia Woolf Building of King s College London would open on Kingsway  London   The death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse and she was briefly institutionalised  Modern scholars  including her nephew and biographer  Quentin Bell  have suggested her breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were also influenced by the sexual abuse to which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected by their half brothers George and Gerald Duckworth  which Woolf recalls in her autobiographical essays A Sketch of the Past and 22 Hyde Park Gate    Throughout her life  Woolf was plagued by periodic mood swings and associated illnesses  She spent three short periods in 1910  1912 and 1913 at Burley House  15 Cambridge Park  Twickenham  described as  a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder   Though this instability often affected her social life  her literary productivity continued with few breaks throughout her life   2  Bloomsbury  After the death of their father and Virginia s second nervous breakdown  Vanessa and Adrian sold 22 Hyde Park Gate and bought a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury   Woolf came to know Lytton Strachey  Clive Bell  Rupert Brooke  Saxon Sydney Turner  Duncan Grant  Leonard Woolf  John Maynard Keynes  David Garnett  and Roger Fry  who together formed the nucleus of the intellectual circle of writers and artists known as the Bloomsbury Group  Several members of the group attained notoriety in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax  which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal  Her complete 1940 talk on the hoax was discovered and is published in the memoirs collected in the expanded edition of The Platform of Time  2008   In 1907 Vanessa married Clive Bell  and the couple s interest in avant garde art would have an important influence on Woolf s development as an author   Virginia Stephen married the writer Leonard Woolf on 10 August 1912  Despite his low material status  Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a  penniless Jew   the couple shared a close bond  Indeed  in 1937  Woolf wrote in her diary   Love making—after 25 years can t bear to be separate     you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted  a wife  And our marriage so complete   The two also collaborated professionally  in 1917 founding the Hogarth Press  which subsequently published Virginia s novels along with works by T S  Eliot  Laurens van der Post  and others  The Press also commissioned works by contemporary artists  including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell  The ethos of the Bloomsbury group encouraged a liberal approach to sexuality  and in 1922 she met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville West  wife of Harold Nicolson  After a tentative start  they began a sexual relationship  which  according to Sackville West in a letter to her husband dated August 17  1926  was only twice consummated  However Virginia s intimacy with Vita seems to have continued into the early 1930s  In 1928  Woolf presented Sackville West with Orlando  a fantastical biography in which the eponymous hero s life spans three centuries and both sexes  Nigel Nicolson  Vita Sackville West s son  wrote  The effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in Orlando  the longest and most charming love letter in literature  in which she explores Vita  weaves her in and out of the centuries  tosses her from one sex to the other  plays with her  dresses her in furs  lace and emeralds  teases her  flirts with her  drops a veil of mist around her   After their affair ended  the two women remained friends until Woolf s death in 1941  Virginia Woolf also remained close to her surviving siblings  Adrian and Vanessa  Thoby had died of typhoid fever at the age of 26   3  Work  Woolf began writing professionally in 1900  initially for the Times Literary Supplement with a journalistic piece about Haworth  home of the Brontë family  Her first novel  The Voyage Out  was published in 1915 by her half brother s imprint  Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd  This novel was originally titled Melymbrosia  but Woolf repeatedly changed the draft  An earlier version of The Voyage Out has been reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the public under the intended title  DeSalvo argues that many of the changes Woolf made in the text were in response to changes in her own life  Woolf went on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular success  Much of her work was self published through the Hogarth Press  She is seen as a major twentieth century novelist and one of the foremost modernists   Woolf is considered a major innovator in the English language  In her works she experimented with stream of consciousness and the underlying psychological as well as emotional motives of characters  Woolf s reputation declined sharply after World War II  but her importance was re established with the growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s   Virginia Woolf s peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure her central strength  she is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language  Her novels are highly experimental  a narrative  frequently uneventful and commonplace  is refracted—and sometimes almost dissolved—in the characters  receptive consciousness  Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions  Woolf has often been credited with stream of consciousness writing alongside her modernist contemporaries like James Joyce and Joseph Conrad   The intensity of Virginia Woolf s poetic vision elevates the ordinary  sometimes banal settings—often wartime environments—of most of her novels  For example  Mrs Dalloway  1925  centres on the efforts of Clarissa Dalloway  a middle aged society woman  to organise a party  even as her life is paralleled with that of Septimus Warren Smith  a working class veteran who has returned from the First World War bearing deep psychological scars   To the Lighthouse  1927  is set on two days ten years apart  The plot centres on the Ramsay family s anticipation of and reflection upon a visit to a lighthouse and the connected familial tensions  One of the primary themes of the novel is the struggle in the creative process that beset painter Lily Briscoe while she struggles to paint in the midst of the family drama  The novel is also a meditation upon the lives of a nation s inhabitants in the midst of war  and of the people left behind  It also explores the passage of time  and how women are forced by society to allow men to take emotional strength from them   Orlando  1928  is one of Virginia Woolf s lightest novels  A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty  but who does abruptly turn into a woman   the book is in part a portrait of Woolf s lover Vita Sackville West  It was meant to console Vita for the loss of her ancestral home  though it is also a satirical treatment of Vita and her work  In Orlando  the techniques of historical biographers are being ridiculed  the character of a pompous biographer is being assumed in order for it to be mocked   The Waves  1931  presents a group of six friends whose reflections  which are closer to recitatives than to interior monologues proper  create a wave like atmosphere that is more akin to a prose poem than to a plot centred novel   Flush  A Biography  1933  is a part fiction  part biography of the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning  The book is written from the dog s point of view  Woolf was inspired to write this book from the success of the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street  In the play  Flush is on stage for much of the action  The play was produced for the first time in 1932 by the actress Katharine Cornell   Her last work  Between the Acts  1941   sums up and magnifies Woolf s chief preoccupations  the transformation of life through art  sexual ambivalence  and meditation on the themes of flux of time and life  presented simultaneously as corrosion and rejuvenation—all set in a highly imaginative and symbolic narrative encompassing almost all of English history  This book is the most lyrical of all her works  not only in feeling but in style  being chiefly written in verse  While Woolf s work can be understood as consistently in dialogue with Bloomsbury  particularly its tendency  informed by G  E  Moore  among others  towards doctrinaire rationalism  it is not a simple recapitulation of the coterie s ideals   Woolf s works have been translated into over 50 languages  by writers such as Jorge Luis Borges and Marguerite Yourcenar   3 1  Attitudes toward Judaism  Christianity and fascism  Though happily married to a Jewish man  Woolf often wrote of Jewish characters in stereotypical archetypes and generalisations  including describing some of her Jewish characters as physically repulsive and dirty  She wrote in her diary   I do not like the Jewish voice  I do not like the Jewish laugh   In a 1930 letter to the composer Ethel Smyth  quoted in Nigel Nicolson s biography Virginia Woolf  she recollects her boasts of Leonard s Jewishness confirming her snobbish tendencies   How I hated marrying a Jew—What a snob I was  for they have immense vitality    In another letter to Smyth  Woolf gives a scathing denunciation of Christianity  seeing it as self righteous  egotism  and stating  my Jew has more religion in one toe nail—more human love  in one hair    Woolf and her husband Leonard hated and feared 1930s fascism with its antisemitism even before knowing they were on Hitler s death list for Britain  Her 1938 book Three Guineas was an indictment of fascism   4  Death  After completing the manuscript of her last  posthumously published  novel  Between the Acts  Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced  The onset of World War II  the destruction of her London home during the Blitz  and the cool reception given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work  On 28 March 1941  Woolf put on her overcoat  filled its pockets with stones  walked into the River Ouse near her home  and drowned herself  Woolf s body was not found until 18 April 1941  Her husband buried her cremated remains under an elm in the garden of Monk s House  their home in Rodmell  Sussex   In her last note to her husband she wrote   5  Modern scholarship and interpretations  Though at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime  the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell   Hermione Lee s 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolf s life and work   In 2001 Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A  Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville West and Virginia Woolf  Julia Briggs s Virginia Woolf  An Inner Life  published in 2005  is the most recent examination of Woolf s life  It focuses on Woolf s writing  including her novels and her commentary on the creative process  to illuminate her life  Thomas Szasz s book My Madness Saved Me  The Madness and Marriage of Virginia Woolf  ISBN 0 7658 0321 6  was published in 2006   5 1  Feminism  Recently  studies of Virginia Woolf have focused on feminist and lesbian themes in her work  such as in the 1997 collection of critical essays  Virginia Woolf  Lesbian Readings  edited by Eileen Barrett and Patricia Cramer   Woolf s best known nonfiction works  A Room of One s Own  1929  and Three Guineas  1938   examine the difficulties that female writers and intellectuals face because men hold disproportionate legal and economic power and the future of women in education and society  In The Second Sex  1949   Simone de Beauvoir counts  of all women who ever lived  only three female writers—Emily Brontë  Woolf and  sometimes  Katherine Mansfield—who have explored  the given    5 2  Mental illness  Much scholarship has been made of Woolf s mental illness  described as a  manic depressive illness  in Thomas Caramagno s 1992 book  The Flight of the Mind  Virginia Woolf s Art and Manic Depressive Illness  in which he also warns against the  neurotic genius  way of looking at mental illness  where people rationalise that creativity is somehow born of mental illness  In two books by Stephen Trombley  Woolf is described as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors  and possibly being a woman who is a  victim of male medicine   referring to the contemporary relative lack of understanding about mental illness   Irene Coates s book Who s Afraid of Leonard Woolf  A Case for the Sanity of Virginia Woolf holds that Leonard Woolf s treatment of his wife encouraged her ill health and ultimately was responsible for her death  Though extensively researched  this view is not accepted by Leonard s family  Victoria Glendinning s book Leonard Woolf  A Biography argues that Leonard Woolf was not only supportive of his wife but enabled her to live as long as she did by providing her with the life and atmosphere she needed to live and write  Virginia s own diaries support this view of the Woolfs  marriage   Controversially  Louise A  DeSalvo reads most of Woolf s life and career through the lens of the incestuous sexual abuse Woolf suffered as a young woman in her 1989 book Virginia Woolf  The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on her Life and Work   Woolf s fiction is also studied for its insight into shell shock  war  class and modern British society   6  Depictions  Michael Cunningham s 1998 Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Hours focused on three generations of women affected by Woolf s novel Mrs Dalloway  In 2002  a film version of the novel was released starring Nicole Kidman as Woolf  a role for which she won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Actress  The film also starred Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep and featured an award winning score by the American composer Philip Glass  Susan Sellers  novel Vanessa and Virginia  2008  explores the close sibling relationship between Woolf and her sister  Vanessa Bell  It was adapted for the stage by Elizabeth Wright in 2010 and first performed by Moving Stories Theatre Company   7  Bibliography  7 1  Novels  The Voyage Out  1915   Night and Day  1919   Jacob s Room
