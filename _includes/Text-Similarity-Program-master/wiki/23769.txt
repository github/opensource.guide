Paolo Agostino  or Agostini  Augustinus in Latin  c  1583 – 1629  was an Italian composer and organist of the early Baroque era  He was born perhaps at Vallerano  near Viterbo  He studied under Giovanni Bernardino Nanino  according to the dedication in the third and fourth books of his masses  Subsequently  he married Nanino s daughter   He held a series of positions as organist and maestro di cappella  choirmaster  between 1607 and 1626  when he succeeded Vincenzo Ugolini as maestro of the Cappella Giulia s choir in St  Peter s Basilica   All of his surviving works are sacred music  and most are written in the prima pratica  the conservative polyphonic style of the late 16th century  although some of his motets use some of the new concertato style  He was a highly sophisticated contrapuntist  often using strict canonic techniques  in addition  he used colorful sonorities  changes of meter between sections  and colorful chromaticism  showing an acquaintanceship with contemporary secular practice as well as the work of the Venetian School  An Agnus Dei for eight voices is especially admired and was used as an example in Padre Martini s Saggio di Contrappunto   1  Notes  2  References  James Alphonsus Völker in  3  External links
