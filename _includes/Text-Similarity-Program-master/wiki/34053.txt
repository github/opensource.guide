A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water   Water turbines were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids  Now they are mostly used for electric power generation  Water turbines are mostly found in dams to generate electric power from water kinetic energy   1  History  Water wheels have been used for hundreds of years for industrial power  Their main shortcoming is size  which limits the flow rate and head that can be harnessed  The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years  Development occurred during the Industrial revolution  using scientific principles and methods  They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time   1 1  Swirl  The word turbine was introduced by the French engineer Claude Burdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for  whirling  or a  vortex   The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor  This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power  They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads   Later  impulse turbines were developed which didn t use swirl    1 2  Time line  The earliest known water turbines date to the Roman Empire  Two helix turbine mill sites of almost identical design were found at Chemtou and Testour  modern day Tunisia  dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD  The horizontal water wheel with angled blades was installed at the bottom of a water filled  circular shaft  The water from the mill race entered the pit tangentially  creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine   Johann Segner developed a reactive water turbine  Segner wheel  in the mid 18th century in Kingdom of Hungary  It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines  It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites  Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design  In the 18th century  a Dr  Barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture hall demonstration  The only known surviving example of this type of engine used in power production  dating from 1851  is found at Hacienda Buena Vista in Ponce  Puerto Rico   In 1820  Jean Victor Poncelet developed an inward flow turbine   In 1826  Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward flow turbine  This was an efficient machine  ~80%  that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension  The stationary outlet also had curved guides   In 1844  Uriah A  Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine  Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine   In 1849  James B  Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency  He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design  The Francis turbine  named for him  is the first modern water turbine  It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today  The Francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine  since water flows from the outer circumference towards the centre of runner   Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design  As the water swirls inward  it accelerates  and transfers energy to the runner  Water pressure decreases to atmospheric  or in some cases subatmospheric  as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy   Around 1890  the modern fluid bearing was invented  now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles  As of 2002  fluid bearings appear to have a mean time between failures of more than 1300 years   Around 1913  Viktor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine  a propeller type machine  It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low head hydro sites   1 3  New concept  All common water machines until the late 19th century  including water wheels  were basically reaction machines  water pressure head acted on the machine and produced work  A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer   In 1866  California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level  Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields  Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet  which had converted a high head  hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock  of water to kinetic energy  This is called an impulse or tangential turbine  The water flow velocity  roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery  does a u turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity   In 1879  Lester Pelton  experimenting with a Knight Wheel  developed a Pelton wheel  double bucket design   which exhausted the water to the side  eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel  In about 1895  William Doble improved on Pelton s half cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry  This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency  Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition   Turgo and cross flow turbines were later impulse designs   2  Theory of operation  Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner  creating a force on the blades  Since the runner is spinning  the force acts through a distance  force acting through a distance is the definition of work   In this way  energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine  Water turbines are divided into two groups  reaction turbines and impulse turbines   The precise shape of water turbine blades is a function of the supply pressure of water  and the type of impeller selected   2 1  Reaction turbines  Reaction turbines are acted on by water  which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy  They must be encased to contain the water pressure  or suction   or they must be fully submerged in the water flow   Newton s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines   Most water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low     and medium    head applications  In reaction turbine pressure drop occurs in both fixed and moving blades  It is largely used in dam and large power plants  2 2  Impulse turbines  Impulse turbines change the flow velocity of a water jet  The jet pushes on the turbine s curved blades which changes the direction of the flow  The resulting change in momentum  impulse  causes a force on the turbine blades  Since the turbine is spinning  the force acts through a distance  work  and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy  An impulse turbine is one which the pressure of the fluid flowing over the rotor blades is constant and all the work output is due to the change in kinetic energy of the fluid   Prior to hitting the turbine blades  the water s pressure  potential energy  is converted to kinetic energy by a nozzle and focused on the turbine  No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades  and the turbine doesn t require a housing for operation   Newton s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines   Impulse turbines are often used in very high   300m 1000 ft  head applications   2 3  Power  The power available in a stream of water is   where   power  J s or watts   turbine efficiency  density of water  kg m³   acceleration of gravity  9 81 m s²   head  m   For still water  this is the difference in height between the inlet and outlet surfaces  Moving water has an additional component added to account for the kinetic energy of the flow  The total head equals the pressure head plus flow velocity head     flow rate  m³ s   2 4  Pumped storage hydroelectricity  Some water turbines are designed for pumped storage hydroelectricity  They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off peak electrical hours  and then revert to a water turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand  This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis turbine in design   2 5  Efficiency  Large modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90%   3  Types of water turbines  Reaction turbines   VLH turbine  Francis turbine  Kaplan turbine  Tyson turbine  Gorlov helical turbine Impulse turbine  Water wheel  Pelton wheel  Turgo turbine  Cross flow turbine  also known as the Bánki Michell turbine  or Ossberger turbine   Jonval turbine  Reverse overshot water wheel  Screw turbine  Barkh Turbine  4  Design and application  Turbine selection is based on the available water head  and less so on the available flow rate  In general  impulse turbines are used for high head sites  and reaction turbines are used for low head sites  Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions  since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions   Small turbines  mostly under 10 MW  may have horizontal shafts  and even fairly large bulb type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal  Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head  and makes installation of a generator more economical  Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head  Some impulse turbines use multiple water jets per runner to increase specific speed and balance shaft thrust   4 1  Typical range of heads  • Water wheel • Screw turbine • VLH turbine • Kaplan turbine • Francis turbine • Pelton wheel • Turgo turbine 0 2   H   4    H   head in m  1   H   10 1 5   H   4

new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance  The specific speed is also the main criteria for matching a specific hydro site with the correct turbine type  The specific speed is the speed with which the turbine turns for a particular discharge Q  with unit head and thereby is able to produce unit power   4 3  Affinity laws  Affinity laws allow the output of a turbine to be predicted based on model tests  A miniature replica of a proposed design  about one foot  0 3 m  in diameter  can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence  Affinity laws are derived by requiring similitude between the test model and the application   Flow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner  Differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening  producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions   4 4  Runaway speed  The runaway speed of a water turbine is its speed at full flow  and no shaft load  The turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed  The manufacturer will supply the runaway speed rating   5  Maintenance  Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements  overhaul intervals are on the order of several years  Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal  inspection  and repair of worn parts   Normal wear and tear includes pitting corrosion from cavitation  fatigue cracking  and abrasion from suspended solids in the water  Steel elements are repaired by welding  usually with stainless steel rods  Damaged areas are cut or ground out  then welded back up to their original or an improved profile  Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime  Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs   Other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings  packing box and shaft sleeves  servomotors  cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils  seal rings  wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces   6  Environmental impact  Water turbines are generally considered a clean power producer  as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water  They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades  They produce significant amounts of the world s electrical supply   Historically there have also been negative consequences  mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production  Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers  potentially killing fish  stopping migrations  and disrupting peoples  livelihoods  For example  American Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest had livelihoods built around salmon fishing  but aggressive dam building destroyed their way of life  Dams also cause less obvious  but potentially serious consequences  including increased evaporation of water  especially in arid regions   buildup of silt behind the dam  and changes to water temperature and flow patterns  In the United States  it is now illegal to block the migration of fish  for example the endangered white sturgeon in North America  so fish ladders must be provided by dam builders   7  See also  Archimedes  screw  Hydroelectricity  8  References  9  Notes  Robert Sackett  Preservationist  PRSHPO  Original 1990 draft
