Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material  a vaccine  to stimulate an individual s immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen  Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection  The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified  for example  the influenza vaccine  the HPV vaccine  and the chicken pox vaccine  Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases  widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio  measles  and tetanus from much of the world  The World Health Organization  WHO  reports licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent  or contribute to the prevention and control of  25 vaccine preventable infections   The active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated  non infective  or attenuated  with reduced infectivity  forms of the causative pathogens  or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic  e g   outer coat proteins of a virus   Toxoids are produced for immunization against toxin based diseases  such as the modification of tetanospasmin toxin of tetanus to remove its toxic effect but retain its immunogenic effect   Smallpox was most likely the first disease people tried to prevent by inoculating themselves and was the first disease for which a vaccine was produced  The smallpox vaccine was designed in 1796 by the British physician Edward Jenner  although at least six people had used the same principles years earlier  Louis Pasteur furthered the concept through his work in microbiology  The immunization was called vaccination because it was derived from a virus affecting cows     Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease  causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children  When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979  it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century   In common speech   vaccination  and  immunization  have a similar meaning  This distinguishes it from inoculation  which uses unweakened live pathogens  although in common usage either can refer to an immunization  Vaccination efforts have been met with some controversy on scientific  ethical  political  medical safety  and religious grounds  In rare cases  vaccinations can injure people and  in the United States  they may receive compensation for those injuries under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  Early success and compulsion brought widespread acceptance  and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many diseases in numerous geographic regions   1  Mechanism of function  Generically  the process of artificial induction of immunity  in an effort to protect against infectious disease  works by  priming  the immune system with an  immunogen   Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as immunization  Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens  Some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease  Vaccinia given after exposure to smallpox  within the first three days  is reported to attenuate the disease considerably  and vaccination up to a week after exposure probably offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease  The first rabies immunization was given by Louis Pasteur to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog  Subsequent to this  it has been found that  in people with uncompromised immune systems  four doses of rabies vaccine over 14 days  wound care  and treatment of the bite with rabies immune globulin  commenced as soon as possible after exposure  is effective in preventing the development of rabies in humans  Other examples include experimental AIDS  cancer and Alzheimer s disease vaccines  Such immunizations aim to trigger an immune response more rapidly and with less harm than natural infection   Most vaccines are given by hypodermic injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the intestines  Live attenuated polio  some typhoid and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel   1 1  Adjuvants and preservatives  Vaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants  used to boost the immune response  Tetanus toxoid  for instance  is usually adsorbed onto alum  This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid  People who get an excessive reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when time for a booster occurs   In the preparation for the 1990 Gulf campaign  Pertussis vaccine  not acellular  was used as an adjuvant for Anthrax vaccine  This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the Anthrax  which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent   Vaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi  Until recent years  the preservative thimerosal was used in many vaccines that did not contain live virus  As of 2005  the only childhood vaccine in the U S  that contains thimerosal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine  which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors  Single dose Influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list Thiomersal  its UK name  in the ingredients  Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines  and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product  as they may in the environment and population as a whole   1 2  Vaccination versus inoculation  Many times these words are used interchangeably  as if they were synonyms  In fact  they are different things  As doctor Byron Plant explains   Vaccination is the more commonly used term  which actually consists of a  safe  injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox    Inoculation  a practice probably as old as the disease itself  is the injection of the variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin  commonly on the upper arm of the subject  Often inoculation was done  arm to arm  or less effectively  scab to arm       Vaccination began in the 18th century with the work of Edward Jenner   2  Types  Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response  but there are several ways to do this  Four main types are currently in clinical use   An inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde  Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate  the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response  When manufactured correctly  the vaccine is not infectious  but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles  Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce  booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response   In an attenuated vaccine  live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered  They will replicate  but locally or very slowly  Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination  boosters may be required less often  These vaccines may be produced by passaging  for example  adapting a virus into different host cell cultures  such as in animals  or at suboptimal temperatures  allowing selection of less virulent strains  or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence  There is a small risk of reversion to virulence  which is smaller in vaccines with deletions  Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals  Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens  infectious bursal disease virus  avian infectious bronchitis virus  avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus   avian metapneumovirus    Virus like particle vaccines consist of viral protein s  derived from the structural proteins of a virus  These proteins can self assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid  meaning that they are not infectious  Because of their highly repetitive  multivalent structure  virus like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines  described below   The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus like particle based vaccines currently in clinical use   A subunit vaccine presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles  whole or otherwise  One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium  such as a bacterial toxin  and administering this by itself  A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context  and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism  In addition  subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines  A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation  These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors   3  History  It is believed likely that some form of inoculation was developed in India or China before the 16th century  Scholar Ole Lund comments   The earliest documented examples of vaccination are from India and China in the 17th century  where vaccination with powdered scabs from people infected with smallpox was used to protect against the disease  Smallpox used to be a common disease throughout the world and 20% to 30% of infected persons died from the disease  Smallpox was responsible for 8% to 20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century  The tradition of inoculation may have originated in India in 1000 BCE   The mention of inoculation in the Sact eya Grantham  an Ayurvedic text  was noted by the French scholar Henri Marie Husson in the journal Dictionaire des sciences médicales  Inoculation was reportedly widely practised in China in the reign of the Longqing Emperor  r  1567舑1572  during the Ming Dynasty  1368舑1644   The Anatolian Ottoman Turks knew about methods of inoculation  This kind of inoculation and other forms of variolation were introduced into England by Lady Montagu  a famous English letter writer and wife of the English ambassador at Istanbul between 1716 and 1718  who almost died from smallpox as a young adult and was physically scarred from it  Inoculation was adopted both in England and in America nearly half a century before Jenner s famous smallpox vaccine of 1796 but the death rate of about 2% from this method meant that it was mainly used during dangerous outbreaks of the disease and remained controversial   It was noticed during the eighteenth century that people who had suffered from the less virulent cowpox were immune to smallpox and the first recorded use of this idea was by a farmer Benjamin Jesty at Yetminster who had suffered the disease and transmitted it to his own family in 1774  his sons subsequently not getting the mild version of smallpox when later inoculated in 1789  But it was Edward Jenner  a doctor in Berkeley  who established the procedure by introducing material from a cowpox vesicle on Sarah Nelmes  a milkmaid  into the arm of a boy named James Phipps  Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop  In 1798  Jenner published “An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae” which coined the term vaccination and created widespread interest  He distinguished  true  and  spurious  cowpox  which did not give the desired effect  and developed an  arm to arm  method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual s pustule  Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox  but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material  by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100 000 people were vaccinated    Since then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe  sometimes prescribed by law or regulations  See Vaccination Acts   Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases besides smallpox  Louis Pasteur further developed the technique during the 19th century  extending its use to killed agents protecting against anthrax and rabies  The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect  whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease  and Jenner s vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease for the one protected against  Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner s discovery   Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific vaccine inventor  and developed successful vaccines for measles  mumps  hepatitis A  hepatitis B  chickenpox  meningitis  pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae   In modern times  the first vaccine preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox  The World Health Organization  WHO  coordinated this global eradication effort  The last naturally occurring case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977  In 1988  the governing body of WHO targeted polio for eradication by 2000  Although the target was missed  eradication is very close  The next disease to be targeted for eradication would most likely be measles  which has declined since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963   In 2000  the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and under used vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000  GAVI is now entering its second phase of funding  which extends through 2014   4  Society and culture  To eliminate the risk of outbreaks of some diseases  at various times several governments and other institutions have instituted policies requiring vaccination for all people  For example  an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales  with fines levied on people who did not comply  Common contemporary U S  vaccination policies require that children receive common vaccinations before entering public school   Beginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century  these policies were resisted by a variety of groups  collectively called antivaccinationists  who object on scientific  ethical  political  medical safety  religious  and other grounds  Common objections are that vaccinations do not work  that compulsory vaccination represents excessive government intervention in personal matters  or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe  Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems  allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections   In countries with limited financial resources  limited coverage causes much morbidity and mortality  More affluent countries are able to subsidize vaccinations for at risk groups  resulting in more comprehensive and effective cover  In Australia  for example  the Government subsidizes vaccinations for seniors and indigenous Australians   Public Health Law Research  an independent US based organization  reported in 2009 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for specified jobs as a means of reducing incidence of specific diseases among particularly vulnerable populations  that there is sufficient evidence supporting the effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for attending child care facilities and schools  and that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of standing orders  which allow healthcare workers without prescription authority to administer vaccine as a public health intervention aimed at increasing vaccination rates   4 1  Vaccination autism controversy  A noteworthy allegation of vaccine induced injury is the MMR vaccine controversy  A fraudulent 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield  originally published in The Lancet  presented supposed evidence that the MMR Vaccine  an immunization against measles  mumps and rubella that is typically first administered to children shortly after their first birthday  was linked to the onset of autism spectrum disorders  The article was widely criticized for lack of scientific rigour and then partially retracted in 2004 by Wakefield s co authors  and was fully retracted by The Lancet in 2010  Wakefield was struck off the UK s medical registry for the fraud   However  this Lancet article has sparked a much greater anti vaccination movement across the world  primarily in the United States  Even though the article has been proved to be fraudulent and was retracted  1 in 4 parents still believe vaccines can cause autism  To go on top of this  many parents are deciding not to vaccinate their children because they feel that diseases are no longer present due to all the vaccinations  This is wrong  since diseases can still come back  and even infect vaccinated people due to their ability to mutate when they are able to live in unvaccinated hosts  This can be clearly shown by a case in 2010 there was a whooping cough outbreak in California which was the worst outbreak in 50 years and was entirely due to parents choosing to exempt their children from vaccinations  Additionally  there was a case in Texas in 2012 where 21 members of church contracted measles because the members of the church chose to abstain from immunizations   5  Side effects and injury  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects  Allegations of vaccine injuries in recent decades have appeared in litigation in the U S  Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries  even though most public health officials have said that the claims of injuries were unfounded  In response  several vaccine makers stopped production  which the US government believed could be a threat to public health  so laws were passed to shield makers from liabilities stemming from vaccine injury claims   6  Routes of administration  A vaccine administration may be oral  by injection  intramuscular  intradermal  subcutaneous   by puncture  transdermal or intranasal  Several recent clinical trials have aimed to deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up taken by common mucosal immunity system  thus avoiding the need for injections   7  Global Trends in Vaccination  The World Health Organization  WHO  estimate that vaccination averts 2 3 millions deaths per year  in all age groups  and up to 1 5 million children die each year due to diseases which would have been prevented by vaccination  They estimate that 29% of deaths of children aged 0–59 months in 2013 were vaccine preventable   8  See also  Feline
