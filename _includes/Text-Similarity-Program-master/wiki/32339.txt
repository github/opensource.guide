In the mathematical field of topology  a uniform space is a set with a uniform structure  Uniform spaces are topological spaces with additional structure that is used to define uniform properties such as completeness  uniform continuity and uniform convergence   The conceptual difference between uniform and topological structures is that in a uniform space  one can formalize certain notions of relative closeness and closeness of points  In other words  ideas like  x is closer to a than y is to b  make sense in uniform spaces  By comparison  in a general topological space  given sets A B it is meaningful to say that a point x is arbitrarily close to A  i e   in the closure of A   or perhaps that A is a smaller neighborhood of x than B  but notions of closeness of points and relative closeness are not described well by topological structure alone   Uniform spaces generalize metric spaces and topological groups and therefore underlie most of analysis   1  Definition  There are three equivalent definitions for a uniform space  They all consist of a space equipped with a uniform structure   1 1  Entourage definition  A nonempty collection Φ of subsets U⊆X×X is a uniform structure if it satisfies the following axioms   If U∈Φ  then Δ⊆U  where Δ   x x  x∈X  is the diagonal on X×X   If U∈Φ and U⊆V for V⊆X×X  then V∈Φ   If U∈Φ and V∈Φ  then U∩V∈Φ   If U∈Φ  then there is V∈Φ such that V∘V⊆U  where V∘V denotes the composite of V with itself   The composite of two subsets V and U of X×X is defined by V∘U   x z  ∃y∈X  x y ∈U∧ y z ∈V     If U∈Φ  then U 1∈Φ  where U 1   y x   x y ∈U  is the inverse of U  Properties  2  and  3  state that Φ is a filter  If the last property is omitted we call the space quasiuniform  The elements U of Φ are called entourages from the french word for surroundings   One usually writes U x   y    x y ∈U   On a graph  a typical entourage is drawn as a blob surrounding the  y x  diagonal  the U x ’s are then the vertical cross sections  If  x y  ∈ U  one says that x and y are U close  Similarly  if all pairs of points in a subset A of X are U close  i e   if A ȕ A is contained in U   A is called U small  An entourage U is symmetric if  x y  蜒 U precisely when  y x  蜒 U  The first axiom states that each point is U close to itself for each entourage U  The third axiom guarantees that being  both U close and V close  is also a closeness relation in the uniformity  The fourth axiom states that for each entourage U there is an entourage V that is  half as large   Finally  the last axiom states the essentially symmetric property  closeness  with respect to a uniform structure   A fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity Φ is any set B of entourages of Φ such that every entourage of Ф contains a set belonging to B  Thus  by property 2 above  a fundamental systems of entourages B is enough to specify the uniformity Φ unambiguously  Φ is the set of subsets of X ȕ X that contain a set of B  Every uniform space has a fundamental system of entourages consisting of symmetric entourages   The right intuition about uniformities is provided by the example of metric spaces  if  X d  is a metric space  the sets  form a fundamental system of entourages for the standard uniform structure of X  Then x and y are Ua close precisely when the distance between x and y is at most a   A uniformity Φ is finer than another uniformity Ψ on the same set if Φ ⊇ Ψ  in that case Ψ is said to be coarser than Φ   1 2  Pseudometrics definition  Uniform spaces may be defined alternatively and equivalently using systems of pseudometrics  an approach that is particularly useful in functional analysis  with pseudometrics provided by seminorms   More precisely  let f  X × X → R be a pseudometric on a set X  The inverse images Ua   f –1  0 a   for a   0 can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity  The uniformity generated by the Ua is the uniformity defined by the single pseudometric f  Certain authors call spaces the topology of which is defined in terms of pseudometrics gauge spaces   For a family  fi  of pseudometrics on X  the uniform structure defined by the family is the least upper bound of the uniform structures defined by the individual pseudometrics fi  A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the set of finite intersections of entourages of the uniformities defined by the individual pseudometrics fi  If the family of pseudometrics is finite  it can be seen that the same uniform structure is defined by a single pseudometric  namely the upper envelope sup fi of the family   Less trivially  it can be shown that a uniform structure that admits a countable fundamental system of entourages  and hence in particular a uniformity defined by a countable family of pseudometrics  can be defined by a single pseudometric  A consequence is that any uniform structure can be defined as above by a  possibly uncountable  family of pseudometrics  see Bourbaki  General Topology Chapter IX §1 no  4    1 3  Uniform cover definition  A uniform space  X Θ  is a set X equipped with a distinguished family of uniform covers Θ from the set of coverings of X  forming a filter when ordered by star refinement  One says cover P is a star refinement of cover Q  written P  * Q  if for every A ∈ P  there is a U ∈ Q such that if A ∩ B ≠ ø  B ∈ P  then B ⊆ U  Axiomatically  this reduces to    X  is a uniform cover   If P  * Q and P is a uniform cover  then Q is also a uniform cover   If P and Q are uniform covers  then there is a uniform cover R that star refines both P and Q  Given a point x and a uniform cover P  one can consider the union of the members of P that contain x as a typical neighbourhood of x of  size  P  and this intuitive measure applies uniformly over the space   Given a uniform space in the entourage sense  define a cover P to be uniform if there is some entourage U such that for each x ∈ X  there is an A ∈ P such that U x  ⊆ A  These uniform covers form a uniform space as in the second definition  Conversely  given a uniform space in the uniform cover sense  the supersets of ⋃ A × A   A ∈ P   as P ranges over the uniform covers  are the entourages for a uniform space as in the first definition  Moreover  these two transformations are inverses of each other   2  Topology of uniform spaces  Every uniform space X becomes a topological space by defining a subset O of X to be open if and only if for every x in O there exists an entourage V such that V x  is a subset of O  In this topology  the neighbourhood filter of a point x is  V x    V∈Φ   This can be proved with a recursive use of the existence of a  half size  entourage  Compared to a general topological space the existence of the uniform structure makes possible the comparison of sizes of neighbourhoods  V x  and V y  are considered to be of the  same size    The topology defined by a uniform structure is said to be induced by the uniformity  A uniform structure on a topological space is compatible with the topology if the topology defined by the uniform structure coincides with the original topology  In general several different uniform structures can be compatible with a given topology on X   2 1  Uniformizable spaces  A topological space is called uniformizable if there is a uniform structure compatible with the topology   Every uniformizable space is a completely regular topological space  Moreover  for a uniformizable space X the following are equivalent   X is a Kolmogorov space  X is a Hausdorff space  X is a Tychonoff space  for any compatible uniform structure  the intersection of all entourages is the diagonal   x  x    x in X   Some authors  e g  Engelking  add this last condition directly in the definition of a uniformizable space   The topology of a uniformizable space is always a symmetric topology  that is  the space is an R0 space   Conversely  each completely regular space is uniformizable  A uniformity compatible with the topology of a completely regular space X can be defined as the coarsest uniformity that makes all continuous real valued functions on X uniformly continuous  A fundamental system of entourages for this uniformity is provided by all finite intersections of sets  f ȕ f  1 V   where f is a continuous real valued function on X and V is an entourage of the uniform space R  This uniformity defines a topology  which is clearly coarser than the original topology of X  that it is also finer than the original topology  hence coincides with it  is a simple consequence of complete regularity  for any x ∈ X and a neighbourhood V of x  there is a continuous real valued function f with f x  0 and equal to 1 in the complement of V   In particular  a compact Hausdorff space is uniformizable  In fact  for a compact Hausdorff space X the set of all neighbourhoods of the diagonal in X ȕ X form the unique uniformity compatible with the topology   A Hausdorff uniform space is metrizable if its uniformity can be defined by a countable family of pseudometrics  Indeed  as discussed above  such a uniformity can be defined by a single pseudometric  which is necessarily a metric if the space is Hausdorff  In particular  if the topology of a vector space is Hausdorff and definable by a countable family of seminorms  it is metrizable   3  Uniform continuity  Similar to continuous functions between topological spaces  which preserve topological properties  are the uniform continuous functions between uniform spaces  which preserve uniform properties  Uniform spaces with uniform maps form a category  An isomorphism between uniform spaces is called a uniform isomorphism   A uniformly continuous function is defined as one where inverse images of entourages are again entourages  or equivalently  one where the inverse images of uniform covers are again uniform covers   All uniformly continuous functions are continuous with respect to the induced topologies   4  Completeness  Generalising the notion of complete metric space  one can also define completeness for uniform spaces  Instead of working with Cauchy sequences  one works with Cauchy filters  or Cauchy nets    A Cauchy filter F on a uniform space X is a filter F such that for every entourage U  there exists A∈F with AȕA ⊆ U  In other words  a filter is Cauchy if it contains  arbitrarily small  sets  It follows from the definitions that each filter that converges  with respect to the topology defined by the uniform structure  is a Cauchy filter  A Cauchy filter is called minimal if it contains no smaller  i e   coarser  Cauchy filter  other than itself   It can be shown that every Cauchy filter contains a unique minimal Cauchy filter  The neighbourhood filter of each point  the filter consisting of all neighbourhoods of the point  is a minimal Cauchy filter   Conversely  a uniform space is called complete if every Cauchy filter converges  Any compact Hausdorff space is a complete uniform space with respect to the unique uniformity compatible with the topology   Complete uniform space enjoy the following important property  if f  A → Y is a uniformly continuous function from a dense subset A of a uniform space X into a complete uniform space Y  then f can be extended  uniquely  into a uniformly continuous function on all of X   A topological space that can be made into a complete uniform space  whose uniformity induces the original topology  is called a completely uniformizable space   4 1  Hausdorff completion of a uniform space  As with metric spaces  every uniform space X has a Hausdorff completion  that is  there exists a complete Hausdorff uniform space Y and a uniformly continuous map i  X → Y with the following property   The Hausdorff completion Y is unique up to isomorphism  As a set  Y can be taken to consist of the minimal Cauchy filters on X  As the neighbourhood filter B x  of each point x in X is a minimal Cauchy filter  the map i can be defined by mapping x to B x   The map i thus defined is in general not injective  in fact  the graph of the equivalence relation i x    i x    is the intersection of all entourages of X  and thus i is injective precisely when X is Hausdorff   The uniform structure on Y is defined as follows  for each symmetric entourage V  i e   such that  x y  is in V precisely when  y x  is in V   let C V  be the set of all pairs  F G  of minimal Cauchy filters which have in common at least one V small set  The sets C V  can be shown to form a fundamental system of entourages  Y is equipped with the uniform structure thus defined   The set i X  is then a dense subset of Y  If X is Hausdorff  then i is an isomorphism onto i X   and thus X can be identified with a dense subset of its completion  Moreover  i X  is always Hausdorff  it is called the Hausdorff uniform space associated with X  If R denotes the equivalence relation i x    i x     then the quotient space X R is homeomorphic to i X    5  Examples  Every metric space  M  d  can be considered as a uniform space  Indeed  since a metric is a fortiori a pseudometric  the pseudometric definition furnishes M with a uniform structure  A fundamental system of entourages of this uniformity is provided by the setsThis uniform structure on M generates the usual metric space topology on M  However  different metric spaces can have the same uniform structure  trivial example is provided by a constant multiple of a metric   This uniform structure produces also equivalent definitions of uniform continuity and completeness for metric spaces   Using metrics  a simple example of distinct uniform structures with coinciding topologies can be constructed  For instance  let d1 x y      x 蜢 y   be the usual metric on R and let d2 x y      ex 蜢 ey    Then both metrics induce the usual topology on R  yet the uniform structures are distinct  since    x y      x 蜢 y     1   is an entourage in the uniform structure for d1 but not for d2  Informally  this example can be seen as taking the usual uniformity and distorting it through the action of a continuous yet non uniformly continuous function   Every topological group G  in particular  every topological vector space  becomes a uniform space if we define a subset V of G ȕ G to be an entourage if and only if it contains the set    x  y    x⋅y蜢1 in U   for some neighborhood U of the identity element of G  This uniform structure on G is called the right uniformity on G  because for every a in G  the right multiplication x → x⋅a is uniformly continuous with respect to this uniform structure  One may also define a left uniformity on G  the two need not coincide  but they both generate the given topology on G   For every topological group G and its subgroup H the set of left cosets G H is a uniform space with respect to the uniformity Φ defined as follows  The sets   where U runs over neighborhoods of the identity in G  form a fundamental system of entourages for the uniformity Φ  The corresponding induced topology on G H is equal to the quotient topology defined by the natural map G → G H   6  History  Before André Weil gave the first explicit definition of a uniform structure in 1937  uniform concepts  like completeness  were discussed using metric spaces  Nicolas Bourbaki provided the definition of uniform structure in terms of entourages in the book Topologie Générale and John Tukey gave the uniform cover definition  Weil also characterized uniform spaces in terms of a family of pseudometrics   7  See
