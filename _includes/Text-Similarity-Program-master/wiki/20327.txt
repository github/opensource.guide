The 68HC11  6811 or HC11 for short  is an 8 bit microcontroller  µC  family introduced by Motorola in 1985  Now produced by Freescale Semiconductor  it descended from the Motorola 6800 microprocessor  It is a CISC microcontroller  The 68HC11 devices are more powerful and more expensive than the 68HC08 microcontrollers  and are used in barcode readers  hotel card key writers  amateur robotics  and various other embedded systems  The MC68HC11A8 was the first MCU to include CMOS EEPROM   1  Architecture  Internally  the HC11 instruction set is upward compatible with the 6800  with the addition of a Y index register   Instructions using the Y register have opcodes prefixed with the byte 0x18   It has two eight bit accumulators  A and B  two sixteen bit index registers  X and Y  a condition code register  a 16 bit stack pointer  and a program counter  In addition  there is an 8 x 8 bit multiply  A x B   with full 16 bit result  and Fractional Integer 16 bit by 16 bit Divide instructions  A range of 16 bit instructions treat the A and B registers as a combined 16 bit D register for comparison  X and Y registers may also be compared to 16 bit memory operands   addition  subtraction and shift operations  or can add the B accumulator to the X or Y index registers  Bit test operations have also been added  performing a logical AND function between operands  setting the correct conditions codes  but not modifying the operands   Different versions of the HC11 have different numbers of external ports  labeled alphabetically  The most common version has five ports  A  B  C  D  and E  but some have as few as 3 ports  version D3   Each port is eight bits wide except for D  which is six bits  in some variations of the chip  D also has eight bits   It can be operated with an internal program and RAM  1 to 768 bytes  or an external memory of up to 64 kilobytes  With external memory  B and C are used as address and data bus  In this mode  port C is multiplexed to carry both the lower byte of the address and data   2  Implementations  In the early 1990s Motorola produced an evaluation board kit for the 68HC11 with several UARTs  RAM  and an EPROM  The cost of the evaluation kit was $68 11   The standard bootloader for the HC11 family is called BUFFALO   Bit User Fast Friendly Aid to Logical Operation   a BUFFALO prompt seen on the serial port at bootup is a sign that a board s flash memory has been erased   Not all HC11 models come with the BUFFALO bootloader  The 68HC11A0 and A1 do not but the A8 does   3  Other versions  The Freescale 68HC16 microcontroller family is intended as a 16 bit mostly software compatible upgrade of the 68HC11   The Freescale 68HC12 microcontroller family is an enhanced 16 bit version of the 68HC11   The Handy Board robotics controller by Fred Martin is based on the 68HC11   A MC68HC24 port replacement unit is available for the HC11  When placed on the external address bus  it replicates the original functions of B and C  Port A has input capture  output compare  pulse accumulator  and other timer functions  port D has serial I O  and port E has an analog to digital converter  ADC    4  References  5  External links
