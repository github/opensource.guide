In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then he has four outs  the two remaining cards of each rank that he holds   One s number of outs is often used to describe a drawing hand   I had a two outer  meaning you had a hand that only two cards in the deck could improve to a winner  for example  In draw poker  one also hears the terms  12 way  or  16 way  straight draw for hands such as 6♥ 7♥ 8♠  Joker   in which any of sixteen cards  4 fours  4 fives  4 nines  4 tens  can fill a straight   The number of outs can be converted to the probability of making the hand on the next card by dividing the number of outs by the number of unseen cards  For example  say a Texas Holdem player holds two spades  and two more appear in the flop  He has seen five cards  regardless of the number of players  as there are no upcards in Holdem except the board   of which four are spades  He thus has 9 outs for a flush out of 47 cards yet to be drawn  giving him a 9 47 chance to fill his flush on the turn  If he fails on the turn  he then has a 9 46 chance to fill on the river  Calculating the combined odds of filling on either the turn or river is more complicated  it is  1     38 47  *  37 46     or about 35%  A common approximation used is to double the number of outs and add one for the percentage to hit on the next card  or to multiply outs by four for the either of two case  This approximation works out to within a 1% error margin for up to 14 outs   Note that the hidden cards of a player s opponents may affect the calculation of outs  For example  assume that a Texas hold  em board looks like this after the third round  5♠ K♦ 7♦ J♠  and that a player is holding A♦ 10♦  The player s current hand is just a high ace  which is not likely to win unimproved  so the player has a drawing hand  He has a minimum of nine outs for certain  called nut outs  because they will make his hand the best possible  those are the 2♦  3♦  4♦  6♦  8♦  9♦  and Q♦  which will give him an ace high flush with no possible better hand on the board  and the Q♣ and Q♥  which will give him an ace high straight with no higher hand possible  The 5♦ and J♦ will also make him an ace high flush  so those are possible outs since they give him a hand that is likely to win  but they also make it possible for an opponent to have a full house  if the opponent has something like K♠ K♣  for example   Likewise  the Q♠ will fill his ace high straight  but will also make it possible for an opponent to have a spade flush  It is possible that an opponent could have as little as something like 7♣ 9♣  making a pair of sevens   in this case even catching any of the three remaining aces or tens will give the player a pair to beat the opponent s  so those are even more potential outs  In sum  the player has 9 guaranteed outs  and possibly as many as 18  depending on what cards he expects his opponents to have   1  See also  Poker strategy  Drawing  Poker probability  Texas hold  em   2  References
