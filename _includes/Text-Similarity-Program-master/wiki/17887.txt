Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever  LHF  is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus and first described in 1969 in the town of Lassa  in Borno State  Nigeria  Lassa fever is a member of the arenaviridae virus family  Similar to Ebola  clinical cases of the disease had been known for over a decade but had not been connected with a viral pathogen  The infection is endemic in West African countries  resulting in 300 000–500 000 cases annually  causing approximately 5 000 deaths  Outbreaks of the disease have been observed in Nigeria  Liberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea  and the Central African Republic  The primary animal host of the Lassa virus is the Natal Multimammate Mouse  Mastomys natalensis   an animal indigenous to most of Sub Saharan Africa  The virus is probably transmitted by contact with the feces or urine of animals accessing grain stores in residences  Given its high rate of incidence  Lassa fever is a major problem in the African region   1  Signs and symptoms  In 80% of cases  the disease is asymptomatic  but in the remaining 20%  it takes a complicated course  It is estimated that the virus is responsible for about 5 000 deaths annually  The fever accounts for up to one third of deaths in hospitals within the affected regions and 10 to 16% of total cases   After an incubation period of six to twenty one days  an acute illness with multiorgan involvement develops  Non specific symptoms include fever  facial swelling  and muscle fatigue  as well as conjunctivitis and mucosal bleeding  The other symptoms arising from the affected organs are   Gastrointestinal tract  Nausea  Vomiting  bloody   Diarrhea  bloody   Stomach ache  Constipation  Dysphagia  difficulty swallowing   Hepatitis  Cardiovascular system  Pericarditis  Hypertension  Hypotension  Tachycardia  abnormally high heart rate   Respiratory tract  Cough  Chest pain  Dyspnoea  Pharyngitis  Pleuritis  Nervous system  Encephalitis  Meningitis  Unilateral or bilateral hearing deficit  Seizures Clinically  Lassa fever infections are difficult to distinguish from other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola and Marburg  and from more common febrile illnesses such as malaria   The virus is excreted in urine for three to nine weeks and in semen for three months   2  Cause  Lassa virus is zoonotic  transmitted from animals   in that it spreads to humans from rodents  specifically multi mammate rats  Mastomys natalensis   This is probably the most common rodent in equatorial Africa  ubiquitous in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas  In these rats infection is in a persistent asymptomatic state  The virus is shed in their excreta  urine and feces   which can be aerosolized  In fatal cases  Lassa fever is characterized by impaired or delayed cellular immunity leading to fulminant viremia   Infection in humans typically occurs by exposure to animal excrement through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts  Inhalation of tiny particles of infective material  aerosol  is believed to be the most significant means of exposure  It is possible to acquire the infection through broken skin or mucous membranes that are directly exposed to infective material  Transmission from person to person has also been established  presenting a disease risk for healthcare workers  Frequency of transmission via sexual contact has not been established   3  Diagnosis  There is a range of laboratory investigations that are performed to diagnose the disease and assess its course and complications  ELISA test for antigen and IgM antibodies gives 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity for the presence of the infection  Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include lymphopenia  low white blood cell count   thrombocytopenia  low platelets   and elevated aspartate aminotransferase  AST  levels in the blood  Lassa fever can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid  In West Africa  where Lassa is most prevalent  it is difficult for doctors to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform tests  In cases with abdominal pain  diagnoses in endemic countries are often made for other illnesses  such as appendicitis and intussusception  delaying treatment with Ribavirin   4  Prevention  Control of the Mastomys rodent population is impractical  so measures are limited to keeping rodents out of homes and food supplies  as well as maintaining effective personal hygiene  Gloves  masks  laboratory coats  and goggles are advised while in contact with an infected person  These issues in many countries are monitored by a department of public health  In less developed countries these types of organizations may not have the necessary means to effectively control outbreaks   Researchers at the USAMRIID facility  where military biologists study infectious diseases  have a promising vaccine candidate  They have developed a replication competent vaccine against Lassa virus based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein  After a single intramuscular injection  test primates have survived lethal challenge  while showing no clinical symptoms   5  Treatment  All persons suspected of Lassa fever infection should be admitted to isolation facilities and their body fluids and excreta properly disposed of   Early and aggressive treatment using Ribavirin was pioneered by Joe McCormick in 1979  After extensive testing  it was determined that early administration is critical to success  Additionally  Ribavirin is almost twice as effective when given intravenously as when taken by mouth  Ribavirin is a prodrug which appears to interfere with viral replication by inhibiting RNA dependent nucleic acid synthesis  although the precise mechanism of action is disputed  The drug is relatively inexpensive  but the cost of the drug is still very high for many of those in West African states  Fluid replacement  blood transfusion and fighting hypotension are usually required  Intravenous interferon therapy has also been used   When Lassa fever infects pregnant women late in their third trimester  it is necessary to induce delivery for the mother to have a good chance of survival  This is because the virus has an affinity for the placenta and other highly vascular tissues  The fetus has only a one in ten chance of survival no matter what course of action is taken  hence focus is always on saving the life of the mother  Following delivery  women should receive the same treatment as other Lassa fever patients   SIGA Technologies is developing an antiviral drug that has been shown effective in treating experimentally infected guinea pigs  In a study conducted at the U S  Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases  USAMRIID   treatment with ST 193 once a day for 14 days resulted in significant reduction in mortality  71% of the animals survived at the low dose   whereas all untreated animals and those treated with ribavirin died within 20 days of the infection Due to threat of disease being used as a potential military weapon  a vaccine to reverse the disease is still being worked on   As serious as the disease is  there are numerous accounts of survival  However  there have been lasting effects of the disease   6  Prognosis  About 15% 20% of hospitalized Lassa fever patients will die from the illness  It is estimated that the overall mortality rate is 1%  however during epidemics mortality can climb as high as 50%  The mortality rate is greater than 80% when it occurs in pregnant women during their third trimester  fetal death also occurs in nearly all those cases  Abortion decreases the risk of death to the mother   Thanks to treatment with Ribavirin  fatality rates are continuing to decline  Work on a vaccine is continuing  with multiple approaches showing positive results in animal trials   7  Epidemiology  The dissemination of the infection can be assessed by prevalence of antibodies to the virus in populations of   Sierra Leone 8–52%  Guinea 4–55%  Nigeria approx  21% Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever in West Africa  Studies show up to half a million cases of Lassa fever per year in West Africa  with about 5 000 resulting in death  Lassa virus was detected in 25 of 60  42%  patients in northern and central Edo State  The Lassa Virus affects adults and children alike   Like other hemorrhagic fevers  Lassa fever can be transmitted directly from one human to another  It can be contracted by an airborne route or with direct contact with infected human blood  urine  or semen  Transmission through breast milk has also been observed   8  See also  Aniru Conteh  Lujo virus  9  References  Garrett  Laurie  The coming plague  newly emerging diseases in a
