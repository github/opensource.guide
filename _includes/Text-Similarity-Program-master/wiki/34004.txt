team of several worms  During the course of the game  players take turns selecting one of their worms  They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents  worms  thereby winning the game  Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways  normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the  Bungee  and  Ninja Rope   to move to otherwise inaccessible areas  Each turn is time limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving  The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series   Over fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played  and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a  scheme  for easy selection in future games  Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates  from which additional weapons can be obtained  and  Sudden Death  where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires  Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels   When most weapons are used  they cause explosions that deform the terrain  creating circular cavities  The types of playable terrains include  island   terrain floating on a body of water   or  cave   cave with water at the bottom and terrain at both top and bottom of the screen  this type is not available in 3 D versions due to camera restrictions and that certain weapons such as  Air Strike  cannot go through   If a worm is hit with a weapon  the amount of damage dealt to the worm will be removed from the worm s initial amount of health  The damage dealt to the attacked worm or worms after any player s turn is shown when all movement on the battlefield has ceased   Worms die when one of the following situations occur   When a worm enters water  either by falling off the island  through a hole in the bottom of it  or by the waterline being raised above the worm   When a worm is thrown off either side of the arena  When a worm s health is reduced to zero  3  Weapons and tools  The Worms series is particularly notable for its extensive variety of weapons  With each new game that is released  new weapons are added  though many were removed in the 3D versions for gameplay reasons  As a result  the 2D series has accumulated 60 weapons  and the 3D series 40 weapons   The weapons available in the game range from a standard timed grenade and homing missiles to exploding sheep and the highly destructive Banana Bomb  possible reference to the weapons in Gorillas game   both of which have appeared in every Worms game so far  More recently  the Worms series has seen weapons such as the iconic Holy Hand Grenade  the Priceless Ming Vase and the Inflatable Scouser   Some of the bizarre weapons in a particular game are based on topical subjects at the time of the game s release  The Mail Strike  for example  which consists of a flying postbox dropping explosive envelopes  is a reference to the postal strikes of the time  while the Mad Cow refers to Britain s BSE epidemic of the 1990s  The French Nuclear Test  introduced in Worms 2  was even updated to the Indian Nuclear Test in Worms Armageddon to keep with the times   Other weapons are distinctly inside jokes  The MB Bomb  for example  which floats down from the sky and explodes on impact  is a cartoon caricature of Martyn Brown  Team17 s studio director  Other such weapons include the  Concrete Donkey   one of the most powerful weapons in the game  which is based on a garden ornament in Andy Davidson s home garden  and an airstrike known in the game as Mike s Carpet Bomb was actually inspired by a store near the Team17 headquarters called  Mike s Carpets    Since Worms Armageddon  weapons that were intended to aid as utilities rather than damage dealers were classified as tools  This classification mainly differs in the fact that they do not fall in ordinary weapon crates  and instead appear in toolboxes  Many tools were left in the wrong class for the sake of keyboard shortcut conveniences  This was resolved in Worms 3D   Some weapons were inspired from popular Movies and TV programs  including the Holy Hand Grenade  from Monty Python and the Holy Grail  and Ninja Rope  named the Bat Rope in early demos of the original game   4  Audio  One of the defining features of the Worms series is its light hearted audio  Although the first few Worms games used darker  more authentic battlefield sounds for its ambient music  all of the games included a large number of high pitched catchphrases shouted by the worms during the course of battle  such as  I ll get you     Revenge     Stupid   and  Bombs away     Worms & Reinforcements United and its sequels gave players the ability to pick between a variety of speech sets  called  sound banks   for each platoon of worms  Many were based on regional accents  such as  The Raj  and  Angry Scots   while others  like  Drill Sergeant   made use of stereotypes  Players could even record their own speech sets and use those instead   The ambient and theme music for Worms 2  Worms Armageddon  Worms World Party and  in part  Worms 3D  was entirely provided by Bjørn Lynne   The whole Worms series has a light hearted themesong  known as the Wormsong  5  History  The game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a Blitz BASIC programming competition run by the Amiga Format magazine  a cut down version of the programming language having been covermounted previously  The game at this stage was called Total Wormage  possibly in reference to Total Carnage  and it did not win the competition  Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success  He then took the game to the European Computer Trade Show  where Team17 had a stand  Team17 made an offer on the spot to develop and publish the game   It subsequently evolved into a full commercial game  renamed Worms  available initially only for the Commodore Amiga computer  As the game was extremely popular  it was regularly released for other platforms including Windows  and Macintosh based computers  Atari Jaguar  Mega Drive Genesis  Dreamcast  Nintendo 64  Nintendo Game Boy  Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance  Nintendo GameCube  Nokia N Gage  SNES  PlayStation and PlayStation 2  Sega Saturn  Microsoft Pocket PC  and Xbox   During the development of Worms 2  Andy Davidson wrote Worms  The Director s Cut  a special edition produced exclusively for the Amiga  This was  in his eyes  the pinnacle of the series  Featuring weapons not seen in any Worms game before or since  it looks like an enhanced version of the original game  Only 5000 copies were ever sold  It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated   5 1  New engine  The engine was completely redesigned using Microsoft s DirectX for Worms 2  dropping the darker tones of the first generation and adopting a more cartoonish look along the way made possible by newer technology  Worms 2 marked the first true step in the widespread Worm craze and characterised the direction which the series would take from then on  The second Worms version is by far the most customisable of the Worms games  with an extensive set of detailed settings and toggles  Worms 2 also introduced internet play  which has since become a staple in the series  Worms 2 saw the return and enhancements of its predecessor s arsenal  e g   the Banana Bomb    Super Banana Bomb   as well as the addition of new weapons and tools  The game s interface is very dated by today s standards  resembling more of a generic Windows application than the colourful screens in later releases   Worms Armageddon was initially intended to be released as an expansion pack for Worms 2  but was released as a stand alone game when it exceeded all expectations  Worms Armageddon included 33 in depth missions in an extensive and elaborate campaign  along with training missions  a  deathmatch  feature  some new graphics and sounds  and a few new weapons and utilities  Much of the customization of Worms 2 was removed  as Team17 thought that the interface would become cluttered and overwhelming   Worms Armageddon also included a much more organized and functional internet play service  known as  WormNET   which required registration and provided leagues and ranks  Problems with cheating led to the removal of the leagues  but their re introduction is planned in a series of updates that have provided the game with more customization  Other more subtle changes to the game include new physics to the ninja rope  and the removal of an in game glitch that allowed players to inflict huge damage to another worm  by aiming the mortar  a common weapon with high ammo  vertically above another player  The mortar shell would then return to earth and create a small but incredibly powerful explosion  In Worms Armageddon  the mortar shell would fall slightly to either side of the target worm if the same glitch was tried  Also  the booby trapped crates were removed as Team 17 deemed them  unfair    An official Worms Armageddon screensaver was included with a release bundling the title with Addiction Pinball  The compilation  The Armageddon Collection  is now out of print   Worms World Party was originally designed for Dreamcast console to make use of its online capabilities  but was also released for the PlayStation and PC with new missions  a mission editor  and some extra customization  This was also released later in 2005 for the N Gage Game Deck  A new feature  the WormPot  was added in all versions of the game except for the Dreamcast release  where it was omitted  With no new weapons  graphics or sounds   The extensive customization of the 2D series  along with good online play support  has led to enduring popularity  A variety of unusual  schemes  have been developed by the WormNET community that are often played instead of the official schemes created by Team17  Some schemes have  rules  agreed to by the players but not enforced by the game itself   5 2  Transition to 3D  In 2003  Worms 3D was released for PlayStation 2  Nintendo GameCube  Macintosh  Windows  and Xbox  This was the first game in the series to bring the characters into a three dimensional environment  It features a  poxel  engine  described as a hybrid of polygons and voxels  the 3D analogues of pixels   This allows for pseudo realistic terrain deformation similar in style to the 2D games  in which the terrain was represented by a bitmap  The second 3D game in the series was Worms Forts  Under Siege  for PlayStation 2  Xbox and PC  It was released in November 2004 and features the biggest deviation from the traditional gameplay that the series has so far seen  Players  worms are able to build forts  and the objective of the game has shifted from simply killing the enemy worms  as players can now win a game by destroying the opponent s fort  Due to the change in strategy  this game could be seen more as a spin off — though some aspects like the customizable costumes were carried into Worms 4  Mayhem   Worms 4  Mayhem was released in 2005  It was a revamp of the original Worms 3D engine  featuring smoother terrain deformation and improved graphics  resulting in a more polished feel closer to the second generation Worms games  The gameplay is much the same as it was in Worms 3D  but new gameplay modes and weapons have been introduced  and the user interface has been improved and simplified  New features include the ability to select customized costumes for teams  and the ability to create custom weapons   Worms  Open Warfare  for the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS  is specifically designed for the handheld systems and was released in March 2006  The game is considered to be a remake of the first Worms game  featuring enhanced graphics but no new weapons  The game has received mixed reviews   Worms  Open Warfare 2 for the PSP and DS is the sequel to Worms  Open Warfare  It was released on August 31  2007 in Europe  and it was released in the U S  later on September 6  2007   Worms was developed by Team17 for release on Xbox Live Arcade  Worms was released on March 7  2007  It was released on PSN on March 26  2009 in the US and April 2009 in the UK   Worms  A Space Oddity was developed by Team17 exclusively for Nintendo s Wii system  using a heavily modified version of the Worms  Open Warfare 2 engine  The game was released in March 2008  with a Sci fi theme   Worms 2  Armageddon was developed by Team17 for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network  The game is heavily inspired by Worms Armageddon s success  and tries to mimic the game s physics and several other aspects  such as the variety of available weapons  Several new weapons are also available  such as a gas pump which fills underground tunnels with poison gas   Worms  Reloaded was developed and published by Team17 for the PC  It was released on 26 August 2010  It is an extended port version of the game Worms 2  Armageddon which was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3  and so it has returned to the original 2D format  unlike the last three PC games   Worms  Battle Islands was developed by Team 17 and published by THQ and it was released on the Wii and PlayStation Portable   Worms  Ultimate Mayhem was released in 2011  It was a revamp of the original Worms 3D and Worms 4  Mayhem engine  and it was released on Microsoft Windows  Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network   Worms  Revolution was released in 2012  It was released on Microsoft Windows  Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network  It was made as a 2 5D game  enabling players to play in a 3D world viewed from a 2D perspective   Worms  Clan Wars was released in 2013 as a PC exclusive   Worms Battlegrounds was released in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One  5 3  Cancelled games  In 2003  the company cancelled Worms Battle Rally  a karting game that allowed for fragging opponents   5 4  Worm Appearance  The games in the Worms series had an almost realistic look for the worms in the cover  although in game play  it is hard to point out the details due to the limitations of screen resolution  The appearance changed for Worms 2  which brought in a more cartoon look to the worms in the cover  The later Worms games retain this appearance with few changes  Worms Forts  Under Siege was the first game of the series to have team costumes   6  Franchise awards  Titles in the franchise have received a variety of awards    Most original game    EMAP Awards   Best game    BBC s Live & Kicking   Most original game    ECTS Awards   Best game    Micromania Awards   Best strategy title    PSX Developers   Strategy game of the year    EGM   Best strategy game    Trophee d or   Multiplayer game of the year    GMBH  7  Reception  While the first versions of the game were generally praised  the series has since been criticized for the lack of meaningful additions  In 2001  Metacritic quoted Worms World Party reviews with comments like  it s virtually nothing more than an expansion pack for Worms Armageddon  and  as ActionTrip s Dejan Grbavcic put it   And I thought that only Eidos was impertinent enough to keep selling the same game with a slightly different name      In 2007  IGN included the Worms series in its list of game franchises that have jumped the shark   8  References and notes  9  See also  Worms Blast  Warmux  an open source clone   Onlineworms
