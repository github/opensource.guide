MPEG 4 is a method of defining compression of audio and visual  AV  digital data  It was introduced in late 1998 and designated a standard for a group of audio and video coding formats and related technology agreed upon by the ISO IEC Moving Picture Experts Group  MPEG   ISO IEC JTC1 SC29 WG11  under the formal standard ISO IEC 14496 – Coding of audio visual objects  Uses of MPEG 4 include compression of AV data for web  streaming media  and CD distribution  voice  telephone  videophone  and broadcast television applications   1  Background  MPEG 4 absorbs many of the features of MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 and other related standards  adding new features such as  extended  VRML support for 3D rendering  object oriented composite files  including audio  video and VRML objects   support for externally specified Digital Rights Management and various types of interactivity  AAC  Advanced Audio Coding  was standardized as an adjunct to MPEG 2  as Part 7  before MPEG 4 was issued   MPEG 4 is still an evolving standard and is divided into a number of parts  Companies promoting MPEG 4 compatibility do not always clearly state which  part  level compatibility they are referring to  The key parts to be aware of are MPEG 4 Part 2  including Advanced Simple Profile  used by codecs such as DivX  Xvid  Nero Digital and 3ivx and by QuickTime 6  and MPEG 4 part 10  MPEG 4 AVC H 264 or Advanced Video Coding  used by the x264 encoder  Nero Digital AVC  QuickTime 7  and high definition video media like Blu ray Disc    Most of the features included in MPEG 4 are left to individual developers to decide whether or not to implement  This means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire MPEG 4 set of standards  To deal with this  the standard includes the concept of  profiles  and  levels   allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications   Initially  MPEG 4 was aimed primarily at low bit rate video communications  however  its scope as a multimedia coding standard was later expanded  MPEG 4 is efficient across a variety of bit rates ranging from a few kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second  MPEG 4 provides the following functions   Improved coding efficiency over MPEG 2  Ability to encode mixed media data  video  audio  speech   Error resilience to enable robust transmission  Ability to interact with the audio visual scene generated at the receiver  2  Overview  MPEG 4 provides a series of technologies for developers  for various service providers and for end users   MPEG 4 enables different software and hardware developers to create multimedia objects possessing better abilities of adaptability and flexibility to improve the quality of such services and technologies as digital television  animation graphics  the World Wide Web and their extensions   Data network providers can use MPEG 4 for data transparency  With the help of standard procedures  MPEG 4 data can be interpreted and transformed into other signal types compatible with any available network   The MPEG 4 format provides end users with a wide range of interaction with various animated objects   Standardized Digital Rights Management signaling  otherwise known in the MPEG community as Intellectual Property Management and Protection  IPMP   The MPEG 4 format can perform various functions  among which might be the following   Multiplexes and synchronizes data  associated with media objects  in such a way that they can be efficiently transported further via network channels   Interaction with the audio visual scene  which is formed on the side of the receiver   2 1  Profiles and Levels  MPEG 4 provides a large and rich set of tools for encoding  Subsets of the MPEG 4 tool sets have been provided for use in specific applications  These subsets  called  Profiles   limit the size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement  In order to restrict computational complexity  one or more  Levels  are set for each Profile  A Profile and Level combination allows   A codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard needed  while maintaining interworking with other MPEG 4 devices that implement the same combination   Checking whether MPEG 4 devices comply with the standard  referred to as conformance testing   3  MPEG 4 Parts  MPEG 4 consists of several standards—termed  parts —including the following  each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification    Profiles are also defined within the individual  parts   so an implementation of a part is ordinarily not an implementation of an entire part   MPEG 1  MPEG 2  MPEG 7 and MPEG 21 are other suites of MPEG standards   4  MPEG 4 Levels  The low profile levels are part of the MPEG 4 video encoding decoding constraints and are compatible with the older ITU H 261 standard  also compatible with former analog TV standards for broadcast and records  such as NTSC or PAL video   The ASP profile in its highest level is suitable for most usual DVD medias and players or for many online video sites  but not for Blu ray records or online HD video contents   More advanced profiles for HD media have been defined later in the AVC profile  which is functionally identical to the ITU H 264 standard but are now also integrated in MPEG 4 Part 10  see H 264 MPEG 4 AVC for the list of defined levels in this AVC profile    5  Licensing  MPEG 4 contains patented technologies  the use of which requires licensing in countries that acknowledge software algorithm patents  Over two dozen companies claim to have patents covering MPEG 4  MPEG LA licenses patents required for MPEG 4 Part 2 Visual from a wide range of companies  audio is licensed separately  and lists all of its licensors and licensees on the site  New licenses for MPEG 4 System patents are under development and no new licenses are being offered while holders of its old MPEG 4 Systems license are still covered under the terms of that license for the patents listed      AT&T is trying to sue companies such as Apple Inc  over alleged MPEG 4 patent infringement  The terms of Apple s QuickTime 7 license for users describes in paragraph 14 the terms under Apple s existing MPEG 4 System Patent Portfolio license from MPEGLA   6  See also  MPEG  MPEG 4 Structured Audio  MPEG 4 SLS  ISO IEC JTC 1 SC 29  7
