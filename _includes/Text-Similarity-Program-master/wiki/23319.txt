Palladium is a chemical element with symbol Pd and atomic number 46  It is a rare and lustrous silvery white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston  He named it after the asteroid Pallas  which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena  acquired by her when she slew Pallas  Palladium  platinum  rhodium  ruthenium  iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals  PGMs   These have similar chemical properties  but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them   Over half of the supply of palladium and its congener platinum goes into catalytic converters  which convert up to 90% of harmful gases from auto exhaust  hydrocarbons  carbon monoxide  and nitrogen dioxide  into less harmful substances  nitrogen  carbon dioxide and water vapor   Palladium is also used in electronics  dentistry  medicine  hydrogen purification  chemical applications  groundwater treatment and jewelry  Palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells  which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity  heat  and water   Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare  and the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa  the Stillwater Complex in Montana  United States  the Thunder Bay District of Ontario  Canada  and the Norilsk Complex in Russia  Recycling is also a source of palladium  mostly from scrapped catalytic converters  The numerous applications and limited supply sources of palladium result in the metal attracting considerable investment interest   1  Characteristics  Palladium belongs to group 10 in the periodic table  but has a very atypical configuration in its outermost electron shells compared to the other members of group 10  see also niobium  41   ruthenium  44   and rhodium  45    having fewer filled electron shells than the elements directly preceding it  a phenomenon unique to palladium   This makes its valence shell have 10 more electrons than the noble gases   Palladium is a soft silver white metal that resembles platinum  It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals  It is soft and ductile when annealed and greatly increases its strength and hardness when it is cold worked  Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid  in hot  concentrated sulfuric acid  and  when finely divided  in hydrochloric acid   Common oxidation states of palladium are 0  +1  +2 and +4  There are relatively few known compounds with palladium unambiguously in the +3 oxidation state  though such compounds have been proposed as intermediates in many palladium catalyzed cross coupling reactions  In 2002  palladium VI  was first reported   1 1  Isotopes  Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes  which includes six stable isotopes  The most stable radioisotopes are 107Pd with a half life of 6 5 million years  found in nature   103Pd with a half life of 17 days  and 100Pd with a half life of 3 63 days  Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 90 94948 64  u  91Pd  to 122 93426 64  u  123Pd   Most of these have half lives that are less than thirty minutes  except 101Pd  half life  8 47 hours   109Pd  half life  13 7 hours   and 112Pd  half life  21 hours    For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope  106Pd  the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium  The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver   Radiogenic 107Ag is a decay product of 107Pd and was first discovered in 1978 in the Santa Clara meteorite of 1976  The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event  107Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies  which have been melted since accretion of the solar system  must reflect the presence of short lived nuclides in the early solar system   1 2  Compounds  Palladium does not react with oxygen at normal temperatures  and thus does not tarnish in air   Palladium heated to 800 °C will produce a layer of palladium II  oxide  PdO   It tarnishes lightly in a moist atmosphere containing sulfur  Palladium primarily exists in the 0  +2  and +4 oxidation states  the +4 oxidation state is comparatively rare  One major example of palladium IV  is hexachloropalladate IV    PdCl6 2−   Elemental palladium reacts with chlorine to give palladium II  chloride  it dissolves in nitric acid and precipitates palladium II  acetate on addition of acetic acid  These two compounds and the bromide are reactive and relatively inexpensive  making them convenient entry points to palladium chemistry  All three are not monomeric  the chloride and bromide often must be refluxed in acetonitrile to obtain the more reactive acetonitrile complex monomers  for example   Palladium II  chloride is the principal starting material for many other palladium catalysts  It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts  palladium on barium sulfate  palladium on carbon  and palladium chloride on carbon  It reacts with triphenylphosphine in coordinating solvents to give bis triphenylphosphine palladium II  dichloride  a useful catalyst  Where desired  the catalyst may be formed in situ   Reduction of this phosphine complex with hydrazine with more phosphine gives tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium 0   one of the two major palladium 0  complexes   The other major palladium 0  complex  tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium 0   Pd2 dba 3   is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone   Mixed valence palladium complex of Pd4 CO 4 OAc 4Pd acac 2 forms an infinite Pd chain structure  with alternatively interconnected Pd4 CO 4 OAc 4 and Pd acac 2 units   The great many reactions in which palladium compounds serve as catalysts are collectively known as palladium catalyzed coupling reactions  Prominent examples include the Heck  Suzuki and Stille reactions  Palladium II  acetate  tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium 0   Pd PPh3 4  and tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium 0   Pd2 dba 3  are useful in this regard  either as catalysts or as starting points to catalysts   2  History  William Hyde Wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab book and named it palladium in August of the same year  Wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it  without naming the discoverer  in a small shop in Soho in April 1803  After harsh criticism that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury by Richard Chenevix  Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 British pounds for 20 grains of synthetic palladium alloy  Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium  Wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium  He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805   It was named by Wollaston in 1802 after the asteroid Pallas  which had been discovered two months earlier  Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia  neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide  and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride  He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium II  cyanide  which was heated to extract palladium metal   Palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of 0 065 g per day  approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight   This treatment had many negative side effects  and was later replaced by more effective drugs   In the run up to 2000  the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because the export quota was not granted on time  for political reasons  The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001  Around this time  the Ford Motor Company  fearing auto vehicle production disruption due to a possible palladium shortage  stockpiled large amounts of the metal purchased near the price high  When prices fell in early 2001  Ford lost nearly US$1 billion  World demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000  The global production of palladium from mines was 222 tonnes in 2006 according to the United States Geological Survey  Most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry  There are currently concerns about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of Russia s military maneuvers in Ukraine  partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports  any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014   3  Occurrence  In 2007  Russia was the top producer of palladium  with a 44% world share  followed by South Africa with 40%  Canada with 6% and the U S  with 5% are the only other substantial producers of palladium   Palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains  Australia  Ethiopia  North and South America  For the production of palladium these deposits play only a minor role  The most important commercial sources are nickel copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin  Ontario  and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia  The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa  The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States  Palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite   Palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel  see synthesis of precious metals  though this source for palladium is not used  None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high level radioactive waste   4  Applications  The largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters  Palladium is also used in jewelry  dentistry  watch making  blood sugar test strips  aircraft spark plugs and in the production of surgical instruments and electrical contacts  Palladium is also used to make professional transverse flutes  As a commodity  palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964  Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes  the others being gold  silver and platinum  Palladium was also a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989   4 1  Catalysis  When it is finely divided  such as in palladium on carbon  palladium forms a versatile catalyst and speeds up hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions  as well as in petroleum cracking  A large number of carbon–carbon bond forming reactions in organic chemistry  such as the Heck reaction and Suzuki coupling  are facilitated by catalysis with palladium compounds   see Palladium Compounds and palladium catalyzed coupling reactions  In addition  palladium  when dispersed on conductive materials  proves to be an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media  In 2010  palladium catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry  Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis  It is used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations  A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for making carbon fluoride bonds  Palladium is found in the Lindlar catalyst  also called Lindlar s Palladium   4 2  Electronics  The second biggest application of palladium in electronics is in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors  in which palladium  and palladium silver alloys  are used as electrodes  Palladium  sometimes alloyed with nickel  is used in connector platings in consumer electronics   It is also used in plating of electronic components and in soldering materials  The electronic sector consumed 1 07 million troy ounces  33 2 tonnes  of palladium in 2006  according to a Johnson Matthey report   4 3  Technology  Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium  thus  it provides a means of purifying the gas  Membrane reactors with Pd membranes are therefore used for the production of high purity hydrogen  Palladium is a part of the palladium hydrogen electrode in electrochemical studies  Palladium II  chloride can oxidize large amounts of carbon monoxide gas  and is used in carbon monoxide detectors   4 4  Hydrogen storage  Palladium readily absorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride PdHx with x below 1  While this property is common to many transition metals  palladium is unique by the high absorption capacity and by that it does not lose its ductility until high x values  This property has been investigated for designing an efficient  yet inexpensive hydrogen storage material  palladium itself is prohibitively expensive for this purpose    The content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to the magnetic susceptibility  which decreases with the increase of hydrogen content  The susceptibility becomes zero for PdH0 62  At higher ratio the solid solution becomes diamagnetic   4 5  Jewelry  Palladium itself has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939  as an alternative to platinum for making white gold  This use resulted from the naturally white color of palladium  which required no rhodium plating  Palladium is much less dense than platinum  Similar to gold  palladium can be beaten into a thin leaf form as thin as 100 nm  1 250 000 in   Unlike platinum  palladium may discolor upon heating to above   it is relatively brittle and reacts with strong acids such as nitric acid   Palladium is one of the three most popular metals used to make white gold alloys  nickel and silver can also be used   Palladium gold is a more expensive alloy than nickel gold  but seldom causes allergic reactions  though certain cross allergies with nickel may occur    When platinum was declared a strategic government resource during World War II  many jewelry bands were made out of palladium  As recently as September 2001  palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry also due to the technical obstacle of casting  However  the casting problem has been resolved and its use in jewelry has increased because of a large spike in the price of platinum and a drop in the price of palladium   Prior to 2004  the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold  In early 2004  when gold and platinum prices rose steeply  China began fabricating significant volumes of palladium jewelry and used 37 tonnes of palladium for this purpose in 2005  Changes of the relative price between palladium and platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 17 4 tonnes in 2009   In January 2010  hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom  and it became a legal requirement to hallmark all articles of jewellery described as being wholly or partly made of palladium  Articles can be marked as containing a minimum of either 500  950 or 999 parts per thousand of palladium   Fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver  rather than gold  appearance is desired  Sheaffer has used palladium plating for many decades  either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or to cover the gold completely   4 6  Photography  With the platinotype printing process photographers make fine art black and white prints using platinum or palladium salts  Often used with platinum  palladium provides an alternative to silver   5  Precautions  Finely divided palladium metal can be pyrophoric  As a platinum group metal  the bulk material is quite inert  Although contact dermatitis has been reported  the amount of data on the effects of exposure to palladium is limited  It has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel  making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic   A considerable amount of palladium is distributed by the exhausts of cars with catalytic converters  Between 4 and 108 ng km of palladium particulate is released by such cars  Its total uptake from food is estimated to be lower than 2 µg per person a day  The second possible source for palladium is alloys for dental restoration  there the possible uptake of palladium is estimated to be lower than 15 µg per person per day  People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably higher uptake  For soluble compounds like palladium chloride 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days   The median lethal dose  LD50  of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200 mg kg for oral and 5 mg kg for intravenous administration   6  See also  2000s commodities boom  Palladium as an investment  7  References  8  External links  at The Periodic Table of Videos  University
