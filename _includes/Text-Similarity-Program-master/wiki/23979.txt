Claudius Ptolemy      Klaudios Ptolemaios        was a Greco Egyptian writer of Alexandria  known as a mathematician  astronomer  geographer  astrologer  and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology  He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt  wrote in Greek  and held Roman citizenship  Beyond that  few reliable details of his life are known  His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes  This is a very late attestation  however  and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria  where he died around AD 168   Ptolemy was the author of several scientific treatises  three of which were of continuing importance to later Islamic and European science  The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the Almagest  although it was originally entitled the  Mathematical Treatise     Mathēmatikē Syntaxis  and then known as the  Great Treatise     Ē Megálē Syntaxis   The second is the Geography  which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the Greco Roman world  The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day  This is sometimes known as the Apotelesmatika    but more commonly known as the Tetrabiblos from the Greek    meaning  Four Books  or by the Latin Quadripartitum   1  Background  The name Claudius is a Roman nomen  the fact that Ptolemy bore it indicates he lived under the Roman rule of Egypt with the privileges and political rights of Roman citizenship  It would have suited custom if the first of Ptolemy s family to become a citizen  whether he or an ancestor  took the nomen from a Roman called Claudius who was responsible for granting citizenship  If  as was common  this was the emperor  citizenship would have been granted between AD 41 and 68  when Claudius  and then Nero  were emperors   The astronomer would also have had a praenomen  which remains unknown   Ptolemaeus  Πτολεμαῖος – Ptolemaios  is a Greek name  It occurs once in Greek mythology  and is of Homeric form  It was common among the Macedonian upper class at the time of Alexander the Great  and there were several of this name among Alexander s army  one of whom made himself King of Egypt in 323 BC  Ptolemy I Soter  All the kings after him  until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC  were also Ptolemies   Perhaps for no other reason than the association of name  the 9th century Persian astronomer Abu Ma shar assumed Ptolemy to be a member of Egypt s royal lineage  stating that the ten kings of Egypt who followed Alexander were wise  and included Ptolemy the Wise  who composed the book of the Almagest   Abu Ma shar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line  composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy   We can evidence historical confusion on this point from Abu Ma shar s subsequent remark “It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the Almagest  The correct answer is not known”  There is little evidence on the subject of Ptolemy s ancestry  apart from what can be drawn from the details of his name  see above   however  modern scholars refer to Abu Ma’shar’s account as erroneous  and it is no longer doubted that the astronomer who wrote the Almagest also wrote the Tetrabiblos as its astrological counterpart   Ptolemy wrote in Greek and can be shown to have utilized Babylonian astronomical data  He was a Roman citizen  but most scholars conclude that Ptolemy was ethnically Greek  although some suggest he was a Hellenized Egyptian  He was often known in later Arabic sources as  the Upper Egyptian   suggesting he may have had origins in southern Egypt  Later Arabic astronomers  geographers and physicists referred to him by his name in Batlaymus   2  Astronomy  The Almagest is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy  Babylonian astronomers had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating astronomical phenomena  Greek astronomers such as Hipparchus had produced geometric models for calculating celestial motions  Ptolemy  however  claimed to have derived his geometrical models from selected astronomical observations by his predecessors spanning more than 800 years  though astronomers have for centuries suspected that his models  parameters were adopted independently of observations  Ptolemy presented his astronomical models in convenient tables  which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets  The Almagest also contains a star catalogue  which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus  Its list of forty eight constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations  but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky  only the sky Hipparchus could see   Through the Middle Ages  it was the authoritative text on astronomy  with its author becoming an almost mythical figure  called Ptolemy  King of Alexandria  The Almagest was preserved  like most of Classical Greek science  in Arabic manuscripts  hence its familiar name   Because of its reputation  it was widely sought and was translated twice into Latin in the 12th century  once in Sicily and again in Spain  Ptolemy s model  like those of his predecessors  was geocentric and was almost universally accepted until the appearance of simpler heliocentric models during the scientific revolution   His Planetary Hypotheses went beyond the mathematical model of the Almagest to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres  in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe  He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1 210 Earth radii  while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20 000 times the radius of the Earth   Ptolemy presented a useful tool for astronomical calculations in his Handy Tables  which tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun  Moon and planets  the rising and setting of the stars  and eclipses of the Sun and Moon  Ptolemy s Handy Tables provided the model for later astronomical tables or zījes  In the Phaseis  Risings of the Fixed Stars   Ptolemy gave a parapegma  a star calendar or almanac  based on the hands and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year   3  The Geography  Ptolemy s other main work is his Geography  also called the Geographia   This also is a compilation of what was known about the world s geography in the Roman Empire during his time  He relied somewhat on the work of an earlier geographer  Marinos of Tyre  and on gazetteers of the Roman and ancient Persian Empire   The first part of the Geography is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used  As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest  Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme  Following Marinos  he assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew  in a grid that spanned the globe  Latitude was measured from the equator  as it is today  but Ptolemy preferred to express it as climata  the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc  the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the polar circle  In books 2 through 7  he used degrees and put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew  the  Blessed Islands   often identified as the Canary Islands  as suggested by the location of the six dots labelled the  FORTUNATA  islands near the left extreme of the blue sea of Ptolemy s map here reproduced   Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world  oikoumenè  and of the Roman provinces  In the second part of the Geography  he provided the necessary topographic lists  and captions for the maps  His oikoumenè spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to the middle of China  and about 80 degrees of latitude from Shetland to anti Meroe  east coast of Africa   Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe  and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean   The maps in surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy s Geography  however  only date from about 1300  after the text was rediscovered by Maximus Planudes  It seems likely that the topographical tables in books 2–7 are cumulative texts – texts which were altered and added to as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy  This means that information contained in different parts of the Geography is likely to be of different dates   Maps based on scientific principles had been made since the time of Eratosthenes  in the 3rd century BC  but Ptolemy improved map projections  It is known from a speech by Eumenius that a world map  an orbis pictus  doubtless based on the Geography  was on display in a school in Augustodunum  Gaul in the third century  In the 15th century  Ptolemy s Geography began to be printed with engraved maps  the earliest printed edition with engraved maps was produced in Bologna in 1477  followed quickly by a Roman edition in 1478  Campbell  1987   An edition printed at Ulm in 1482  including woodcut maps  was the first one printed north of the Alps  The maps look distorted when compared to modern maps  because Ptolemy s data were inaccurate  One reason is that Ptolemy estimated the size of the Earth as too small  while Eratosthenes found 700 stadia for a great circle degree on the globe  Ptolemy uses 500 stadia in the Geography  It is highly probable that these were the same stadion  since Ptolemy switched from the former scale to the latter between the Syntaxis and the Geography  and severely readjusted longitude degrees accordingly  See also Ancient Greek units of measurement and History of geodesy   Because Ptolemy derived many of his key latitudes from crude longest day values  his latitudes are erroneous on average by roughly a degree  2 degrees for Byzantium  4 degrees for Carthage   though capable ancient astronomers knew their latitudes to more like a minute   Ptolemy s own latitude was in error by 14    He agreed  Geography 1 4  that longitude was best determined by simultaneous observation of lunar eclipses  yet he was so out of touch with the scientists of his day that he knew of no such data more recent than 500 years before  Arbela eclipse   When switching from 700 stadia per degree to 500  he  or Marinos  expanded longitude differences between cities accordingly  a point first realized by P Gosselin in 1790   resulting in serious over stretching of the Earth s east west scale in degrees  though not distance  Achieving highly precise longitude remained a problem in geography until the invention of the marine chronometer at the end of the 18th century  It must be added that his original topographic list cannot be reconstructed  the long tables with numbers were transmitted to posterity through copies containing many scribal errors  and people have always been adding or improving the topographic data  this is a testimony to the persistent popularity of this influential work in the history of cartography   4  Astrology  Ptolemy has been referred to as “a pro astrological authority of the highest magnitude”  His astrological treatise  a work in four parts  is known by the Greek term Tetrabiblos  or the Latin equivalent Quadripartitum  ‘Four Books’  Ptolemy s own title is unknown  but may have been the term found in some Greek manuscripts  Apotelesmatika  roughly meaning  Astrological Outcomes    Effects  or ‘Prognostics’   As a source of reference  the Tetrabiblos is said to have  enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more   It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli  Tiburtinus  in 1138  while he was in Spain  The Tetrabiblos is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of horoscopic astrology  That it did not quite attain the unrivaled status of the Almagest was  perhaps  because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject  particularly electional astrology  interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time   and medical astrology  which were later adoptions   The great popularity that the Tetrabiblos did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology  and as a compendium of astrological lore  rather than as a manual  It speaks in general terms  avoiding illustrations and details of practice  Ptolemy was concerned to defend astrology by defining its limits  compiling astronomical data that he believed was reliable and dismissing practices  such as considering the numerological significance of names  that he believed to be without sound basis   Much of the content of the Tetrabiblos was collected from earlier sources  Ptolemy s achievement was to order his material in a systematic way  showing how the subject could  in his view  be rationalized  It is  indeed  presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the Almagest was the first  concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the sublunar sphere  Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the planets  based upon their combined effects of heating  cooling  moistening  and drying   Ptolemy s astrological outlook was quite practical  he thought that astrology was like medicine  that is conjectural  because of the many variable factors to be taken into account  the race  country  and upbringing of a person affects an individual s personality as much as  if not more than  the positions of the Sun  Moon  and planets at the precise moment of their birth  so Ptolemy saw astrology as something to be used in life but in no way relied on entirely   A collection of one hundred aphorisms about astrology called the Centiloquium  ascribed to Ptolemy  was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic  Latin and Hebrew scholars  and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the Tetrabiblos as a kind of summation  It is now believed to be a much later pseudepigraphical composition  The identity and date of the actual author of the work  referred to now as Pseudo Ptolemy  remains the subject of conjecture   5  Music  Ptolemy also wrote an influential work  Harmonics  on music theory and the mathematics of music  After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors  Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios  in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus and in agreement with the followers of Pythagoras   backed up by empirical observation  in contrast to the overly theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans   Ptolemy wrote about how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa in Harmonics  This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras  However  Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3 2  whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve tetrachords and octaves  He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave  which he derived with the help of a monochord  Ptolemy s astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the  music of the spheres   See  Ptolemy s intense diatonic scale   6  Optics  His Optics is a work that survives only in a poor Arabic translation and in about twenty manuscripts of a Latin version of the Arabic  which was translated by Eugene of Palermo  c  1154   In it Ptolemy writes about properties of light  including reflection  refraction  and colour  The work is a significant part of the early history of optics and influenced the more famous 11th century Optics by Alhazen  Ibn al Haytham   It contains the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water  for which the values  with the exception of the 60° angle of incidence   although historically praised as experimentally derived  appear to have been obtained from an arithmetic progression   The work is also important for the early history of perception  Ptolemy combined the mathematical  philosophical and physiological traditions  He held an extramission intromission theory of vision  the rays  or flux  from the eye formed a cone  the vertex being within the eye  and the base defining the visual field  The rays were sensitive  and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces  Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation  This was one of the early statements of size distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy  a view supported by the Stoics  Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour  size  shape  movement and binocular vision  He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgemental factors  He offered an obscure explanation of the sun or moon illusion  the enlarged apparent size on the horizon  based on the difficulty of looking upwards   7  Named after Ptolemy  There are several characters or items named after Ptolemy  including   The crater Ptolemaeus on the Moon   The crater Ptolemaeus on Mars   The asteroid
