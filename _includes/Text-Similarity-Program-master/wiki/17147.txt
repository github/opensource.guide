A killer micro is a microprocessor based machine that infringes on mini  mainframe  or supercomputer performance turf  It originally referred to the replacement of vector supercomputers built with bipolar technology by Massively Parallel Processors  MPP  assembled from a larger number of lower performing microprocessors  These systems faced initial skepticism  based on the assumption that applications do not have significant parallelism  because of Amdahl s law  but the success of early systems such as nCUBE and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following Moore s law led to a fast replacement   Taken from the title of Eugene Brooks   of Lawrence Livermore Labs  talk  Attack of the Killer Micros  at Supercomputing 1990  This title was probably chosen after the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes cult film   1  References  2  External links
