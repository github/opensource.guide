Pope Zosimus  died 27 December 418  reigned from 18 March 417 to his death in 418  He was born in Mesoraca  Calabria   He succeeded Innocent I and was followed by Boniface I  Zosimus took a decided part in the protracted dispute in Gaul as to the jurisdiction of the See of Arles over that of Vienne  giving energetic decisions in favour of the former  but without settling the controversy  His fractious temper coloured all the controversies in which he took part  in Gaul  Africa and Italy  including Rome  where at his death the clergy were very much divided   According to the Liber Pontificalis  Zosimus was a Greek and his father s name was Abram  Historian Adolf von Harnack deduced from this that the family was of Jewish origin  but this cannot be certain   Nothing is known of the life of Zosimus before his elevation to the Papal See  His consecration as Bishop of Rome took place on 18 March 417  The festival was attended by Patroclus  Bishop of Arles  who had been raised to that See in place of Bishop Heros of Arles  who had been deposed by Constantius III  Patroclus gained the confidence of the new pope at once  as early as 22 March he received a papal letter which conferred upon him the rights of a metropolitan over all the bishops of the Gallic provinces of Viennensis and Narbonensis I and II  In addition  he was made a kind of papal vicar for the whole of Gaul  no Gallic ecclesiastic being permitted to journey to Rome without bringing with him a certificate of identity from Patroclus   In the year 400  Arles had been substituted for Trier as the residence of the chief government official of the civil Diocese of Gaul  the  Prefectus Praetorio Galliarum   Patroclus  who enjoyed the support of the commander Constantine  used this opportunity to procure for himself the position of supremacy above mentioned  by winning over Zosimus to his ideas  The bishops of Vienne  Narbonne and Marseille regarded this elevation of the See of Arles as an infringement of their rights  and raised objections which occasioned several letters from Zosimus  The dispute  however  was not settled until the pontificate of Pope Leo I   1  Confrontation with Pelagianism  Not long after the election of Zosimus Caelestius  a proponent of Pelagianism who had been condemned by Innocent I  the preceding pope  came to Rome to appeal to the new pope  having been expelled from Constantinople  In the summer of 417  Zosimus held a meeting of the Roman clergy in the Basilica of St  Clement before which Caelestius appeared  The propositions drawn up by the deacon Paulinus of Milan  on account of which Caelestius had been condemned at Carthage in 411  were laid before him  Caelestius refused to condemn these propositions  at the same time declaring in general that he accepted the doctrine expounded in the letters of Pope Innocent and making a confession of faith which was approved  The pope was won over by the calculated conduct of Caelestius  and said that it was not certain whether he had really maintained the false doctrine rejected by Innocent  and therefore Zosimus considered the action of the African bishops against Caelestius too hasty  He wrote at once in this sense to the bishops of the African province  and called upon those who had anything to bring against Caelestius to appear at Rome within two months   Soon after this  Zosimus received from Pelagius a confession of faith  together with a new treatise on free will  The pope held a new synod of the Roman clergy  before which both these writings were read  the assembly held the statements to be orthodox  and Zosimus again wrote to the African bishops defending Pelagius and reproving his accusers  among whom were the Gallic bishops Hero and Lazarus  Archbishop Aurelius of Carthage quickly called a synod  which sent a reply to Zosimus in which it was proved that the pope had been deceived by the heretics  In his answer Zosimus declared that he had settled nothing definitely  and wished to settle nothing without consulting the African bishops  After the new synodal letter of the African council of 1 May 418 to the pope  and after the steps taken by the emperor Honorius against the Pelagians  Zosimus issued his Tractoria  in which Pelagianism and its authors were finally condemned   Shortly after this  Zosimus became involved in a dispute with the African bishops in regard to the right of appeal to the Roman See clerics who had been condemned by their bishops  When the priest Apiarius of Sicca had been excommunicated by his bishop on account of his crimes  he appealed directly to the pope  without regard to the regular course of appeal in Africa which was exactly prescribed  The pope at once accepted the appeal  and sent legates with letters to Africa to investigate the matter  Another  potentially wiser  course would have been to have first referred Apiarius to the ordinary course of appeal in Africa itself  Zosimus next made the further mistake of basing his action on a reputed canon of the First Council of Nicaea  which was in reality a canon of the Council of Sardica  In the Roman manuscripts the canons of Sardica followed those of Nicaea immediately  without an independent title  while the African manuscripts contained only the genuine canons of Nicaea  so that the canon appealed to by Zosimus was not contained in the African copies of the Nicene canons  This mistake ignited a serious disagreement over the appeal  which continued after the death of Zosimus   Besides the writings of the pope already mentioned  there are extant other letters to the bishops of the Byzantine province in Africa  in regard to a deposed bishop  and to the bishops of Gaul and Spain in respect to Priscillianism and ordination to the different grades of the clergy  The Liber Pontificalis attributes to Zosimus a decree on the wearing of the maniple by deacons and on the dedication of Easter candles in the country parishes  also a decree forbidding clerics to visit taverns  Zosimus was buried in the sepulchral Church of St  Laurence in Agro Verano   2  Notes  3  References  4  External links
