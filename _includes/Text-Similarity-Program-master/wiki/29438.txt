Sonar  originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging  is a technique that uses sound propagation  usually underwater  as in submarine navigation  to navigate  communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water  such as other vessels  Two types of technology share the name  sonar   passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels  active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes  Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of  targets  in the water  Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar  Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation  and SODAR  an upward looking in air sonar  is used for atmospheric investigations  The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound  The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low  infrasonic  to extremely high  ultrasonic   The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics   1  History  Although some animals  dolphins and bats  have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years  use by humans in the water is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490  a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube   In the 19th century an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses to provide warning of hazards   The use of sound to  echo locate  underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the Titanic disaster of 1912  The world s first patent for an underwater echo ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Richardson a month after the sinking of the Titanic  and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913   The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden  while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston  built an experimental system beginning in 1912  a system later tested in Boston Harbor  and finally in 1914 from the U S  Revenue  now Coast Guard  Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland Canada  In that test  Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding  underwater communications  Morse Code  and echo ranging  detecting an iceberg at two miles  3 km  range   The so called Fessenden oscillator  at ca  500 Hz frequency  was unable to determine the bearing of the berg due to the 3 metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer s radiating face  less than 1 metre in diameter   The ten Montreal built British H class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with a Fessenden oscillator   During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound  The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones  while the French physicist Paul Langevin  working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer  Constantin Chilowsky  worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915 using quartz  Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used  this work influenced future designs  Lightweight sound sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones  acousto electric transducers for in water use   while Terfenol D and PMN  lead magnesium niobate  have been developed for projectors   1 1  ASDIC  In 1916  under the British Board of Invention and Research  Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A B Wood  producing a prototype for testing in mid 1917  This work  for the Anti Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff  was undertaken in utmost secrecy  and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world s first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus  To maintain secrecy no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made   the word used to describe the early work   supersonics   was changed to  ASD ics  and the quartz material to  ASD ivite  hence the British acronym ASDIC  In 1939  in response to a question from the Oxford English Dictionary  the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for  Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee   and this is still widely believed  though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives   By 1918  both France and Britain had built prototype active systems  The British tested their ASDIC on in 1920  and started production in 1922  The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC equipped vessels in 1923  An anti submarine school  HMS Osprey  and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924  The US Sonar QB set arrived in 1931   By the outbreak of World War II  the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes  and others for submarines  incorporated into a complete anti submarine attack system  The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hamstrung by the use of the depth charge as an anti submarine weapon  This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern  resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack  The hunter was effectively firing blind  during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action  This situation was remedied by using several ships cooperating and by the adoption of  ahead throwing weapons   such as Hedgehog and later Squid  which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and thus still in ASDIC contact  Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets which used several different shapes of beam  continuously covering blind spots  Later  acoustic torpedoes were used   At the start of World War II  British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States  Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US  Many new types of military sound detection were developed  These included sonobuoys  first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea  dipping dunking sonar and mine detection sonar  This work formed the basis for post war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine  Work on sonar had also been carried out in the Axis countries  notably in Germany  which included countermeasures  At the end of World War II this German work was assimilated by Britain and the US  Sonars have continued to be developed by many countries  including Russia  for both military and civil uses  In recent years the major military development has been the increasing interest in low frequency active systems   1 2  SONAR  During the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound detection technology and important discoveries were made  such as thermoclines  that would help future development  After technical information was exchanged between the two countries during the Second World War  Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems  coined as the equivalent of RADAR   2  Active sonar  Active sonar uses a sound transmitter and a receiver  When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation  When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation  When more transmitters  or more receivers  are used  again spatially separated  it is multistatic operation  Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception  Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically   Active sonar creates a pulse of sound  often called a  ping   and then listens for reflections  echo  of the pulse  This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator  power amplifier and electro acoustic transducer array  A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam  which may be swept to cover the required search angles  Generally  the electro acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth  in order to optimise performance of the overall system  Occasionally  the acoustic pulse may be created by other means  e g   1  chemically using explosives  or  2  airguns or  3  plasma sound sources   To measure the distance to an object  the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range by knowing the speed of sound  To measure the bearing  several hydrophones are used  and the set measures the relative arrival time to each  or with an array of hydrophones  by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming  Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used  The target signal  if present  together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing  which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement  It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise  This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display  or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software  Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it  as well as measuring its velocity   The pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency  to allow pulse compression on reception   Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement  while more complex ones generally include the latter technique  Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques  Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc  although the beam may be rotated  relatively slowly  by mechanical scanning   Particularly when single frequency transmissions are used  the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target  The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity  Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion  allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform   One useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight  The head is pointed into the water  a button is pressed  and the device displays the distance to the target  Another variant is a  fishfinder  that shows a small display with shoals of fish  Some civilian sonars  which are not designed for stealth  approach active military sonars in capability  with quite exotic three dimensional displays of the area near the boat   When active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom  it is known as echo sounding  Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement   Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone  underwater acoustic microphone  and projector  underwater acoustic speaker   A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals   pings    When a hydrophone transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal  To measure distance  one transducer projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer hydrophone reply  The time difference  scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two  is the distance between the two platforms  This technique  when used with multiple transducers hydrophones projectors  can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water   In combat situations  an active pulse can be detected by an opponent and will reveal a submarine s position   A very directional  but low efficiency  type of sonar  used by fisheries  military  and for port security  makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non linear sonar  the virtual transducer being known as a parametric array   2 1  Project ARTEMIS  Project ARTEMIS was a one of a kind low frequency sonar for surveillance that was deployed off Bermuda for several years in the early 1960s  The active portion was deployed from a World War II tanker  and the receiving array was a built into a fixed position on an offshore bank   2 2  Transponder  This is an active sonar device that receives a stimulus and immediately  or with a delay  retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one   2 3  Performance prediction  A sonar target is small relative to the sphere  centred around the emitter  on which it is located  Therefore  the power of the reflected signal is very low  several orders of magnitude less than the original signal  Even if the reflected signal was of the same power  the following example  using hypothetical values  shows the problem  Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10 000 W m² signal at 1 m  and detecting a 0 001 W m² signal  At 100 m the signal will be 1 W m²  due to the inverse square law   If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m² target  it will be at 0 001 W m² when it reaches the emitter  i e  just detectable  However  the original signal will remain above 0 001 W m² until 300 m  Any 10 m² target between 100 and 300 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse but would not be detected by the emitter  The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes  Since the original signal is much more powerful  it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar  as in the example    In active sonar there are two performance limitations  due to noise and reverberation  In general one or other of these will dominate so that the two effects can be initially considered separately   In noise limited conditions at initial detection   where SL is the source level  TL is the transmission loss  or propagation loss   TS is the target strength  NL is the noise level  DI is the directivity index of the array  an approximation to the array gain  and DT is the detection threshold   In reverberation limited conditions at initial detection  neglecting array gain    where RL is the reverberation level and the other factors are as before   2 4  Hand held sonar for use by a diver  The LIMIS    Limpet Mine Imaging Sonar  is a hand held or ROV mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver  Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers  combat frogmen or Clearance Divers  to look for limpet mines in low visibility water  Links   Abstract of article by the International Society for Optical Engineering  Used to find debris from the Space Shuttle Columbia crash  Used in fish passage research at hydropower facilities  The LUIS    Lensing Underwater Imaging System  is another imaging sonar for use by a diver  Links   Used for counting salmon in a river  There is or was a small flashlight shaped handheld sonar for divers  that merely displays range   For the INSS   Integrated Navigation Sonar System see      3  Passive sonar  Passive sonar listens without transmitting  It is often employed in military settings  although it is also used in science applications  e g   detecting fish for presence absence studies in various aquatic environments   see also passive acoustics and passive radar  In the very broadest usage  this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound  though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment   3 1  Identifying sound sources  Passive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound  For example  U S  vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems  If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded  the 60 Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship  This can help to identify its nationality  as all European submarines and nearly every other nation s submarine have 50 Hz power systems  Intermittent sound sources  such as a wrench being dropped  may also be detectable to passive sonar  Until fairly recently  an experienced  trained operator identified signals  but now computers may do this   Passive sonar systems may have large sonic databases  but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually  A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships  actions  i e  the speed of a ship  or the type of weapon released   and even particular ships  Publications for classification of sounds are provided by and continually updated by the US Office of Naval Intelligence   3 2  Noise limitations  Passive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle  For this reason  many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps  using silent convection  or fuel cells or batteries  which can also run silently  Vehicles  propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise  High speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water  and this cavitation has a distinct sound   The sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself  Towed units also combat the thermocline  as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline   The display of most passive sonars used to be a two dimensional waterfall display  The horizontal direction of the display is bearing  The vertical is frequency  or sometimes time  Another display technique is to color code frequency time information for bearing  More recent displays are generated by the computers  and mimic radar type plan position indicator displays   3 3  Performance prediction  Unlike active sonar  only one way propagation is involved  Because of the different signal processing used  the minimum detectable signal to noise ratio will be different  The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is   where SL is the source level  TL is the transmission loss  NL is the noise level  DI is the directivity index of the array  an approximation to the array gain  and DT is the detection threshold  The figure of merit of a passive sonar is   4  Performance factors  The detection  classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment  as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar   4 1  Sound propagation  Sonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed  particularly in the vertical plane  Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water  though the difference is small  The speed is determined by the water s bulk modulus and mass density  The bulk modulus is affected by temperature  dissolved impurities  usually salinity   and pressure  The density effect is small  The speed of sound  in feet per second  is approximately   This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures  concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths  Ocean temperature varies with depth  but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change  called the thermocline  dividing the warmer surface water from the cold  still waters that make up the rest of the ocean  This can frustrate sonar  because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent  or refracted  through the thermocline  The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters  However  wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline  Water pressure also affects sound propagation  higher pressure increases the sound speed  which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed  The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell s law   If the sound source is deep and the conditions are right  propagation may occur in the  deep sound channel   This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel  This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries  Similar propagation can occur in the  surface duct  under suitable conditions  However in this case there are reflection losses at the surface   In shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom  where considerable losses can occur   Sound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom  This absorption depends upon frequency  with several different mechanisms in sea water  Long range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects   The sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature  The main noise sources are waves and shipping  The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed dependent low frequency noise   4 2  Scattering  When active sonar is used  scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface  This can be a major source of interference  This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car s headlights in fog  a high intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent  but broader beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions  much of which is scattered back to the observer  overwhelming that reflected from the target   white out    For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimise scattering   4 3  Target characteristics  The sound reflection characteristics of the target of an active sonar  such as a submarine  are known as its target strength  A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales  wakes  schools of fish and rocks   Passive sonar detects the target s radiated noise characteristics  The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification   4 4  Countermeasures  Active  powered  countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level  provide a large false target  and obscure the signature of the submarine itself   Passive  i e   non powered  countermeasures include   Mounting noise generating devices on isolating devices   Sound absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines  for example anechoic tiles   5  Military applications  Modern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water borne vessels  aircraft and fixed installations  Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II  submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces  However  the advent of modern signal processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations  In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter  making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect   The use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team however  use of active sonar on surface ships is very common  Active sonar is used by submarines when if the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position  With surface ships it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data  Any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission  Having heard the signal  it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used  usually with its frequency  and its position  with the sound wave s energy   Active sonar is similar to radar in that  while it allows detection of targets at a certain range  it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range  which is undesirable   Since active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator  and does not allow exact classification of targets  it is used by fast  planes  helicopters  and by noisy platforms  most surface ships  but rarely by submarines  When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines  it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection  Consequently active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar  In aircraft  active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft s patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts   Passive sonar has several advantages  Most importantly  it is silent  If the target radiated noise level is high enough  it can have a greater range than active sonar  and allows the target to be identified  Since any motorized object makes some noise  it may in principle be detected  depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area  as well as the technology used  To simplify  passive sonar  sees  around the ship using it  On a submarine  nose mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°  centered on the ship s alignment  the hull mounted array of about 160° on each side  and the towed array of a full 360°  The invisible areas are due to the ship s own interference  Once a signal is detected in a certain direction  which means that something makes sound in that direction  this is called broadband detection  it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received  narrowband analysis   This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound  Since every engine makes a specific sound  it is straightforward to identify the object  Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT   Another use of passive sonar is to determine the target s trajectory  This process is called Target Motion Analysis  TMA   and the resultant  solution  is the target s range  course  and speed  TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times  and comparing the motion with that of the operator s own ship  Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases   Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful  However  it requires high tech electronic components and is costly  It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection  Surface ships use it to good effect  it is even better used by submarines  and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters  mostly to a  surprise effect   since submarines can hide under thermal layers  If a submarine s commander believes he is alone  he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect  or go deeper and faster  and thus make more sound   Examples of sonar applications in military use are given below  Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use   5 1  Anti submarine warfare  Until recently  ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays  either amidships or at the bow  It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required  The first were made of canvas on a framework  then steel ones were used  Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber  Such sonars are primarily active in operation  An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS 56   Because of the problems of ship noise  towed sonars are also used  These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water  However  there are limitations on their use in shallow water  These are called towed arrays  linear  or variable depth sonars  VDS  with 2 3D arrays  A problem is that the winches required to deploy recover these are large and expensive  VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive   An example of a modern active passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems   5 2  Torpedoes  Modern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active passive sonar  This may be used to home directly on the target  but wake following torpedoes are also used  An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo   Torpedo countermeasures can be towed or free  An early example was the German Sieglinde device while the Bold was a chemical device  A widely used US device was the towed AN SLQ 25 Nixie while Mobile submarine simulator  MOSS  was a free device  A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system   5 3  Mines  Mines may be fitted with a sonar to detect  localize and recognize the required target  Further information is given in acoustic mine and an example is the CAPTOR mine   5 4  Mine countermeasures  Mine Countermeasure  MCM  Sonar  sometimes called  Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar  MOAS    is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects  Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design  An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ 32 Mine hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs  See also Minesweeper  ship   5 5  Submarine navigation  Submarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth  The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed  Information fitted on typical fits is given in Oyashio class submarine and Swiftsure class submarine   5 6  Aircraft  Helicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar  such as the AQS 13  Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them  Processing from the sonobuoys or Dipping Sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship  Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS 20A   5 7  Underwater communications  Dedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication  See also the section on the underwater acoustics page   5 8  Ocean surveillance  For many years  the United States operated a large set of passive sonar arrays at various points in the world s oceans  collectively called Sound Surveillance System  SOSUS  and later Integrated Undersea Surveillance System  IUSS   A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union  As permanently mounted arrays in the deep ocean were utilised  they were in very quiet conditions so long ranges could be achieved  Signal processing was carried out using powerful computers ashore  With the ending of the Cold War a SOSUS array has been turned over to scientific use   In the United States Navy  a special badge known as the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Badge is awarded to those who have been trained and qualified in its operation   5 9  Underwater security  Sonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers  This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports  Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and or disablement mechanism  One such device is the Cerberus system   See Underwater Port Security System and Anti frogman techniques#Ultrasound detection   5 10  Hand held sonar  Limpet Mine Imaging Sonar  LIMIS  is a hand held or ROV mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers  combat frogmen or clearance divers  to look for limpet mines in low visibility water   The LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver   Integrated Navigation Sonar System  INSS  is a small flashlight shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range   5 11  Intercept sonar  This is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars  An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British Vanguard class submarines   6  Civilian applications  6 1  Fisheries  Fishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand  but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems  The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached  However  the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors  sounders and sonars  Historically  fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish  However  acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries   Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish s air filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater  This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound  Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air  Today  commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish  Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth  bottom contour  and bottom composition   Companies such as eSonar  Raymarine UK  Marport Canada  Wesmar  Furuno  Krupp  and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry  For example  net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel  Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function  Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone  The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor   6 2  Echo sounding  Echo sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats  A type of active sonar  echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed  measuring the time between transmission and echo return  after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin  The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well  The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water averaging 1 500 meters per second  by the time between emission and echo return   The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo sounders but  because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo sounder  have been given different terms   6 3  Net location  The net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel  Nevertheless  to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit  which is much greater than in a normal echo sounder  several refinements have to be made  Two main types are available  The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable  In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul  shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation  The second type is the cable less net sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer   in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver hydrophone on the vessel  In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver   The display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom  or the surface   rather than the depth of water as with the echo sounder s hull mounted transducer  Fixed to the headline of the net  the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance  Any fish passing into the net can also be seen  allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible  In other fisheries  where the amount of fish in the net is important  catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod end of the net  As the cod end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel  The skipper can then decide when to haul the net   Modern versions of the net sounder  using multiple element transducers  function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used   The sonar is an echo sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel   6 4  ROV and UUV  Small sonars have been fitted to Remotely Operated Vehicles  ROV  and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles  UUV  to allow their operation in murky conditions  These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle  The Long Term Mine Reconnaissance System is an UUV for MCM purposes   6 5  Vehicle location  Sonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea  Short and Long Baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location  such as LBL   6 6  Prosthesis for the visually impaired  In 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a  spider sense  bodysuit  equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems  which alerts the wearer of incoming threats  allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded   7  Scientific applications  7 1  Biomass estimation  Detection of fish  and other marine and aquatic life  and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques  As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density or acoustic characteristics than the surrounding medium  such as fish  that reflect sound back toward the sound source  These echoes provide information on fish size  location  abundance and behavior  Data is usually processed and analysed using a variety of software such as Echoview  See Also  Hydroacoustics and Fisheries Acoustics   7 2  Wave measurement  An upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period  From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived   7 3  Water velocity measurement  Special short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity   7 4  Bottom type assessment  Sonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into  for example  mud  sand  and gravel  Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add on modules  converting echo parameters into sediment type  Different algorithms exist  but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings  Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated  scientific  echosounders and parametric or fuzzy logic analysis of the acoustic data  See  Acoustic Seabed Classification   7 5  Bathymetric mapping  Side scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography  bathymetry  by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom  Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas   7 6  Sub bottom profiling  Powerful low frequency echo sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom   7 7  Synthetic aperture sonar  Various synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine hunting and search systems  An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar   7 8  Parametric sonar  Parametric sources use the non linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies  A virtual end fire array is formed  Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth  narrow beamwidth  and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes  see Parametric array  Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent  P J  Westervelt s seminal 1963 JASA paper summarizes the trends involved   8  Effect of sonar on marine life  8 1  Effect on marine mammals  Research has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings marine mammals  Beaked whales  the most common casualty of the strandings  have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid frequency active sonar  Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar  while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins  The US Navy  which part funded some of studies  said the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar  not actual harm  but  will evaluate the effectiveness of  their  marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings    Some marine animals  such as whales and dolphins  use echolocation systems  sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey  It is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating   8 2  Effect on fish  High intensity sonar sounds can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish   9  See also  10  Notes  11  References  12  Bibliography  Hackmann  Willem  Seek & Strike  Sonar  anti submarine
