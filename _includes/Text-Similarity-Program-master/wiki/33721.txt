In particle physics and astrophysics  weakly interacting massive particles  or WIMPs  are among the leading hypothetical particle physics candidates for dark matter  The term “WIMP” is given to a dark matter particle that was produced by falling out of thermal equilibrium with the hot dense plasma of the early universe  although it is often used to refer to any dark matter candidate that interacts with standard particles via a force similar in strength to the weak nuclear force  Its name comes from the fact that obtaining the correct abundance of dark matter today via thermal production requires a self annihilation cross section of   which is roughly what is expected for a new particle in the 100 GeV mass range that interacts via the electroweak force  This apparent coincidence is known as the “WIMP miracle”  Because supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics readily predict a new particle with these properties  a stable supersymmetric partner has long been a prime WIMP candidate  However  recent null results from direct detection experiments including LUX and SuperCDMS  along with the failure to produce evidence of supersymmetry in the Large Hadron Collider  LHC  experiment has cast doubt on the simplest WIMP hypothesis  Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs include the search for products of WIMP annihilation  including gamma rays  neutrinos and cosmic rays in nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters  direct detection experiments designed to measure the collision of WIMPs with nuclei in the laboratory  as well as attempts to directly produce WIMPs in colliders such as the LHC   1  Theoretical framework and properties  WIMP like particles are predicted by R parity conserving supersymmetry  a popular type of extension to the standard model of particle physics  although none of the large number of new particles in supersymmetry have been observed  The main theoretical characteristics of a WIMP are   Interactions only through the weak nuclear force and gravity  or possibly other interactions with cross sections no higher than the weak scale   Large mass compared to standard particles  WIMPs with sub GeV masses may be considered to be light dark matter   Because of their lack of electromagnetic interaction with normal matter  WIMPs would be dark and invisible through normal electromagnetic observations  Because of their large mass  they would be relatively slow moving and therefore  cold   Their relatively low velocities would be insufficient to overcome the mutual gravitational attraction  and as a result WIMPs would tend to clump together  WIMPs are considered one of the main candidates for cold dark matter  the others being massive compact halo objects  MACHOs  and axions   These names were deliberately chosen for contrast  with MACHOs named later than WIMPs   Also  in contrast to MACHOs  there are no known stable particles within the standard model of particle physics that have all the properties of WIMPs  The particles that have little interaction with normal matter  such as neutrinos  are all very light  and hence would be fast moving  or  hot    2  WIMPs as dark matter  Although the existence of WIMPs in nature is hypothetical at this point  it would resolve a number of astrophysical and cosmological problems related to dark matter  There is near consensus today among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe is dark  Simulations of a universe full of cold dark matter produce galaxy distributions that are roughly similar to what is observed  By contrast  hot dark matter would smear out the large scale structure of galaxies and thus is not considered a viable cosmological model   The WIMP fits the model of a relic dark matter particle from the early Universe  when all particles were in a state of thermal equilibrium  For sufficiently high temperatures  such as existed in the early Universe  the dark matter particle and its antiparticle would have been both forming from and annihilating into lighter particles  As the Universe expanded and cooled  the average thermal energy of these lighter particles decreased and eventually became insufficient to form a dark matter particle antiparticle pair  The annihilation of the dark matter particle antiparticle pairs  however  would have continued  and the number density of dark matter particles would have begun to decrease exponentially  Eventually  however  the number density would become so low that the dark matter particle and antiparticle interaction would cease  and the number of dark matter particles would remain  roughly  constant as the Universe continued to expand  Particles with a larger interaction cross section would continue to annihilate for a longer period of time  and thus would have a smaller number density when the annihilation interaction ceases  Based on the current estimated abundance of dark matter in the Universe  if the dark matter particle is such a relic particle  the interaction cross section governing the particle antiparticle annihilation can be no larger than the cross section for the weak interaction  If this model is correct  the dark matter particle would have the properties of the WIMP   3  Experimental detection  Because WIMPs may only interact through gravitational and weak forces  they are extremely difficult to detect  However  there are many experiments underway to attempt to detect WIMPs both directly and indirectly  Direct detection refers to the observation of the effects of a WIMP nucleus collision as the dark matter passes through a detector in an Earth laboratory  Indirect detection refers to the observation of annihilation or decay products of WIMPs far away from Earth   Indirect detection efforts typically focus on locations where WIMP dark matter is thought to accumulate the most  in the centers of galaxies and galaxy clusters  as well as in the smaller satellite galaxies of the Milky Way  These are particularly useful since they tend to contain very little baryonic matter  reducing the expected background from standard astrophysical processes  Typical indirect searches look for excess gamma rays  which are predicted both as final state products of annihilation  or are produced as charged particles interact with ambient radiation via inverse Compton scattering  The spectrum and intensity of a gamma ray signal depends on the annihilation products  and must be computed on a model by model basis  Experiments which have placed bounds on WIMP annihilation  via the non observation of an annihilation signal  include the Fermi LAT gamma ray telescope and the VERITAS ground based gamma ray observatory  Although the annihilation of WIMPs into standard model particles also predicts the production of high energy neutrinos  their interaction rate is too low to reliably detect a dark matter signal at present  Future observations from the IceCube observatory in Antarctica may be able to differentiate WIMP produced neutrinos from standard astrophysical neutrinos  however  at present  only 37 cosmological neutrinos have been observed  making such a distinction impossible   Another type of indirect WIMP signal could come from the Sun  Halo WIMPs may  as they pass through the Sun  interact with solar protons  helium nuclei as well as heavier elements  If a WIMP loses enough energy in such an interaction to fall below the local escape velocity  it would not have enough energy to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun and would remain gravitationally bound  As more and more WIMPs thermalize inside the Sun  they begin to annihilate with each other  forming a variety of particles including high energy neutrinos  These neutrinos may then travel to the Earth to be detected in one of the many neutrino telescopes  such as the Super Kamiokande detector in Japan  The number of neutrino events detected per day at these detectors depends upon the properties of the WIMP  as well as on the mass of the Higgs boson  Similar experiments are underway to detect neutrinos from WIMP annihilations within the Earth and from within the galactic center   While most WIMP models indicate that a large enough number of WIMPs must be captured in large celestial bodies for these experiments to succeed  it remains possible that these models are either incorrect or only explain part of the dark matter phenomenon  Thus  even with the multiple experiments dedicated to providing indirect evidence for the existence of cold dark matter  direct detection measurements are also necessary to solidify the theory of WIMPs   Although most WIMPs encountering the Sun or the Earth are expected to pass through without any effect  it is hoped that a large number of dark matter WIMPs crossing a sufficiently large detector will interact often enough to be seen—at least a few events per year  The general strategy of current attempts to detect WIMPs is to find very sensitive systems that can be scaled up to large volumes  This follows the lessons learned from the history of the discovery and  by now  routine detection of the neutrino   3 1  Cryogenic Crystal Detectors  A technique used by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search  CDMS  detector at the Soudan Mine relies on multiple very cold germanium and silicon crystals  The crystals  each about the size of a hockey puck  are cooled to about 50 mK  A layer of metal  aluminium and tungsten  at the surfaces is used to detect a WIMP passing through the crystal  This design hopes to detect vibrations in the crystal matrix generated by an atom being  kicked  by a WIMP  The tungsten transition edge sensors  TES  are held at the critical temperature so they are in the superconducting state  Large crystal vibrations will generate heat in the metal and are detectable because of a change in resistance  CRESST  DAMA  and EDELWEISS run similar setups   In February 2010  researchers at CDMS II announced that they had observed two events that may have been caused by WIMP nucleus collisions  CoGeNT  a smaller detector using a single germanium puck  designed to sense WIMPs with smaller masses  reported hundreds of detection events in 56 days  Juan Collar  who presented the results to a conference at the University of California  was quoted   If it s real  we re looking at a very beautiful dark matter signal    Annual modulation is one of the predicted signatures of a WIMP signal  and on this basis the DAMA collaboration has claimed a positive detection  Other groups  however  have not confirmed this result  The CDMS data made public in May 2004 exclude the entire DAMA signal region given certain standard assumptions about the properties of the WIMPs and the dark matter halo  CDMS and EDELWEISS would be expected to observe a significant number of WIMP nucleus scatters if the DAMA signal were in fact caused by WIMPs   Current limits from LUX and other searches are in disagreement with any WIMP interpretation of these results   KIMS is searching with CsI Tl  crystals and ANAIS is a newer experiment that seeks to replicate the DAMA signal  DM Ice is codeploying NaI crystals wit the IceCube detector at the South Pole   3 2  Noble Gas Scintillators  Another way of detecting atoms  knocked about  by a WIMP is to use scintillating material  so that light pulses are generated by the moving atom and detected  often with PMTs  Experiments such as DEAP at SNOLAB  DarkSide  or WARP at the LNGS plan to instrument a very large target mass of liquid argon for sensitive WIMP searches  ZEPLIN  and XENON used xenon to exclude WIMPs at higher sensitivity until superseded in sensitivity by LUX in 2013  Larger ton scale expansions of these xenon detectors have been approved for construction  PandaX is also using xenon  Neon may used in future studies   3 3  Bubble Chambers  The PICASSO  Project In Canada to Search for Supersymmetric Objects  experiment is a direct dark matter search experiment that is located at SNOLAB in Canada  It uses bubble detectors with Freon as the active mass  PICASSO is predominantly sensitive to spin dependent interactions of WIMPs with the fluorine atoms in the Freon  COUPP  a similar experiment using trifluoroiodomethane CF3I   published limits for mass above 20 GeV in 2011   A bubble detector is a radiation sensitive device that uses small droplets of superheated liquid that are suspended in a gel matrix  It uses the principle of a bubble chamber but since only the small droplets can undergo a phase transition at a time the detector can stay active for much longer periods  When enough energy is deposited in a droplet by ionizing radiation the superheated droplet becomes a gas bubble  The bubble development is accompanied by an acoustic shock wave that is picked up by piezo electric sensors  The main advantage of the bubble detector technique is that the detector is almost insensitive to background radiation  The detector sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the temperature  typically operated between 15 °C and 55 °C  There is another similar experiment using this technique in Europe called    PICASSO reports results  November 2009  for spin dependent WIMP interactions on 19F  for masses of 24 Gev new stringent limits have been obtained on the spin dependent cross section of 13 9 pb  90% CL   The obtained limits restrict recent interpretations of the DAMA LIBRA annual modulation effect in terms of spin dependent interactions   PICO is an expansion of the concept planned in 2015   3 4  Other  Time Project Chambers  TPC  filled with low pressure gases are being studied for WIMP detection  The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks  DRIFT  collaboration is attempting to utilize the predicted directionality of the WIMP signal  DRIFT uses a carbon disulfide target  that allows WIMP recoils to travel several millimetres  leaving a track of charged particles  This charged track is drifted to an MWPC readout plane that allows it to be reconstructed in three dimensions and determine the origin direction  DMTPC is a similar experiment with CF4 gas   4  Recent Limits  The Large Underground Xenon experiment with 370 kilograms of xenon is more sensitive than XENON or CDMS  First results from October 2013 report that no signals were seen  appearing to refute results obtained from less sensitive instruments
