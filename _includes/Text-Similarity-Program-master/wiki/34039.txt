West Pakistan          was one of the two exclaves created at the formation of the modern State of Pakistan following the 1947 Partition of India   After gaining independence from the British in 1947  the State of Pakistan was physically separated into two exclaves  with the western and eastern wings physically separated from each other by the Republic of India  The western wing of Pakistan comprised three Governor s provinces  North West Frontier  West Punjab and Sindh Province   one Chief Commissioner s province  Baluchistan Province   and the Baluchistan States Union along with several other independent princely states  notably Bahawalpur  Chitral  Dir  Hunza  Khairpur and Swat   the Federal Capital Territory around Karachi  and the tribal areas  The eastern wing of the new country – East Pakistan – formed the single province of East Bengal  including the former Assam district of Sylhet    West Pakistan adopted the stance that West Pakistan was the true Pakistan  with East Pakistan as a provincial dominion  The western wing was politically dominant despite East Pakistan having over half of the population and a disproportionately small number of seats in the Constituent Assembly  This inequality of the two wings and the geographical distance between them were believed to be delaying the adoption of a new constitution  To diminish the differences between the two regions  the government decided to reorganise the country into two distinct provinces under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali on 22 November 1954   During most of the Cold War  Pakistan was a close ally of the United States  having an influential membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization  SEATO  and the Central Treaty Organization  CENTO   Geographically divided into two wings  the western contingent  claiming the exclusive mandate for all of Pakistan  considered itself to be the reorganised continuation of the country in the United Nations  President Field Marshal Ayub Khan  who remained in office from 1958 until 1969  worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality  He not only secured membership in SEATO but was also a proponent of agreements that developed CENTO   West Pakistan emerged as one of South Asia s largest economies and military powers  West Pakistan s economy boomed and at its highest peak it was called the  West Germany of East   Its economic progress was only limited to the western side  and the majority of promised funds for East Pakistan were never issued   In 1970  President General Yahya Khan enacted a series of territorial  constitutional and military reforms  These established the   state parliament  and the current provisional borders of Pakistan s four provinces  On 1July 1970  West Pakistan was devolved and renamed  Pakistan  under Legal Framework Order No  1970  which dissolved the  One Unit  and removed the term  West   simply establishing the country as Pakistan  The order had no effect on East Pakistan  which retained the geographical position established in 1955  The next year s civil war  however  resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh   1  Political history  1 1  Independence after British colonial period  At the time of the state establishment in 1947  the of Pakistan participated in the Boundary Commission conference  Headed by Cyril Radcliffe  the Commission was tasked with negotiating the arrangement  area division  and future political set up of Pakistan and India   Pakistan was formed from two distinct areas  separated by a thousand miles and India  The western state was composed of three Governor s provinces  North West Frontier  West Punjab and Sindh Province   one Chief Commissioner s province  Baluchistan Province   the Baluchistan States Union  several other princely states  notably Bahawalpur  Chitral  Dir  Hunza  Khairpur and Swat   the Federal Capital Territory  around Karachi  and the tribal areas  The eastern wing of the new country – East Pakistan – formed the single province of East Bengal  including the former Assam district of Sylhet   West Pakistan experienced great problems related to the divisions  including ethnic and racial friction  lack of knowledge  and uncertainty of where to demarcate the permanent borders  East Pakistan  Balochistan  and the North West Frontier Province experienced little difficulty  but Southern Pakistani Punjab faced considerable problems that had to be fixed  Former East Punjab was integrated with the Indian administration  and millions of Punjabi Muslims were expelled to be replaced by a Sikh and Hindu population and vice versa  The communal violence spread to all over the Indian subcontinent  Economic rehabilitation efforts needing the attention of Pakistan s founding fathers further escalated the problems   The division also divided the natural resources  industries  economic infrastructure  manpower  and military might  with India as the larger share owner  India retained 345 million in population  91%  to Pakistan s 35 million  9%   Land area was divided as 78% to India and 23% to Pakistan  Military forces were divided up with a ratio of 64% for India and 36% for Pakistan  Most of the military assets – such as weapons depots and military bases – were located inside India  facilities in Pakistan were mostly obsolete  and they had a dangerously low ammunition reserve of only one week  Four divisions were raised in West Pakistan  whilst one division was raised in East Pakistan   1 2  Parliamentary democracy  From the time of its establishment  the State of Pakistan had the vision of a federal parliamentary democratic republic form of government  With the founding fathers remaining in West Pakistan  Liaquat Ali Khan was appointed the country s first prime minister  with Mohammad Ali Jinnah as Governor General  West Pakistan claimed the exclusive mandate over all of Pakistan  with the majority of the Pakistan Movement s leading figures in West Pakistan  In 1949  the Constituent Assembly passed the Objectives Resolution and the Annex to the Constitution of Pakistan  paving the road to a Westernized federal parliamentary republic  The work on parliamentary reforms was constituted by the constituent assembly the year after  in 1950   The western section of Pakistan dominated the politics of the new country  Although East Pakistan had over half of the population  it had a disproportionately small number of seats in the Constituent Assembly  This inequality of the two wings and the geographical distance between them was believed to be holding up the adoption of a new constitution  To diminish the differences between the two regions  the government decided to reorganise the country into two distinct provinces   Under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali on 22 November 1954  the four provinces and territories of western Pakistan were integrated into one unit to mirror the single province in the east  The state of West Pakistan was established by the merger of the provinces  states  and tribal areas of West Pakistan  The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Karachi  Later the state capital moved to Lahore  and it was finally established in Islamabad in 1965  The province of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial state capital at Dhaka  Dacca    Clashes between East Pakistan and West Pakistan soon erupted  further destabilising the entire country  The two states had different political ideologies and different lingual cultural aspect  West Pakistan had been founded on the main basis of a parliamentary democracy  and had a parliamentary republic form of government since 1947   with Islam as its state religion  In contrast  East Pakistan had been a socialist state since the 1954 elections  with state secularism proclaimed  West Pakistan sided with the United States and her NATO allies  whilst East Pakistan remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union and her Eastern Bloc  Pakistan s 1956 constitution validated the parliamentary form of government  with Islam as state religion and Urdu  English and Bengali as state languages  The 1956 constitution also established the Parliament of Pakistan as well as the Supreme Court of Pakistan   Ethnic and religious violence in Lahore  which began in 1953  spread all over the country  Muhammad Ali Bogra  prime minister of Pakistan  declared martial law in Lahore to curb the violence  This inter communal violence soon spread to India  and a regional conflicts put West Pakistan and India in a war threatening situation  The prime ministers of Pakistan and India held an emergency meeting in Lahore   1 3  Military dictatorships  From 1947 to 1959  the government was only partially stable  Seven prime ministers  four governors general  and one president were forcefully removed either by constitutional coup or by military coup  The One Unit program was met with harsh opposition  civil unrest  and political disturbance  Support for the Muslim League and Pakistan Socialist Party in the upcoming elections threatened Pakistan s technocracy  The Muslim League and Socialist Party gained momentum after the League s defeat in the 1954 elections  and the Socialist Party were challenging for the constituencies of the President Iskandar Mirza s Republican Party  Relations with the United States deteriorated  with the US assessing that democracy in both states was failing   A US backed military coup d état was launched in 1958 by the Pakistan Army command  The Urdu speaking class and the Bengali nation were forcefully removed from the affairs of West Pakistan  With the imposition of martial law led by then Army Commander in Chief General Ayub Khan  the state capital was moved from Karachi to Army Generals Combatant Headquarters  The GHQ  at Rawalpindi in 1959  whilst the federal legislature was moved to Dacca  In 1963  Rawalpindi had become ineffective as a federal capital  a new city was planned and constructed  finally completing in 1965  In 1965  the state capital was finally re located in Islamabad   1 4  Dissolution in 1970  On contrary perception  the provinces did not benefit from economic progress  but the One Unit program strengthened the central government  In West Pakistan  the four provinces also struggled hard for the abolition of One Unit which caused injustices to them as it was imposed on them   The provisional powerful committees pressured the central government through the means of civil disobedience  violence on street  raising slogans against the martial law  and attacks on government machines such as police forces  For several weeks  the four provinces worked together and guided the  One Unit Dissolution Committee   towards resolving all outstanding issues in time set by the Yahya government  Finally  the committee’s plan went into effect on 1 July 1970  when West Pakistan s  One Unit  was dissolved  and all power was transferred to the provinces of Balochistan  the North West Frontier Province  Punjab and Sindh  President General Yahya Khan issued the decree  simply removing the  West   and adding the word  Pakistan  on 1 July 1970   In the 1970 general elections  held in December 1970 and    the far left Awami League under Mujibur Rahman won an overall majority of seats in Parliament and all but 2 of the 162 seats allocated to East Pakistan  The Awami League advocated greater autonomy for East Pakistan but the military government did not permit Mujibur Rahman to form a government   On 25 March 1971  West Pakistan began a civil war to subdue the democratic victory of East Pakistanis  This began the war between the Pakistani military and the Mukhti Bahini resistance fighters  In November 1971  General Yahya Khan ordered Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police to arrest both Bhutto and Rehman  and he ordered action against East Pakistan s military government  The resulting refugee crisis led to the intervention by India  eventually leading to the surrender of the Pakistani Army  East Pakistan suffered a genocide of its Bengali population   East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh on 16 December 1971  The term West Pakistan became redundant   2  Government  West Pakistan went through many political changes  and had a multiple political party system  West Pakistan s political system consisted of the popular influential Left wing sphere against elite Right wing circles   2 1  Parliamentary republic  Since independence  West Pakistan had been a parliamentary republic  even as of today  the parliamentary system is the official form of government of Pakistan  with a Prime minister as the head of the government and a President as a head of state in a ceremonial office   The 1956 Constitution provided the country with Semi presidential system and the office of President was inaugurated the same year  The career civil service officer Major General  retired  Iskander Mirza became the country s first President  but the system did not evolved for more than the three years  when Mirza imposed the martial law in 1958  Mirza appointed army commander General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator  he later turned his back on the President and exiled him to Great Britain after the military government was installed   The Supreme Court of Pakistan was a judicial authority  a power broker in country s politics that played a major role in minimising the role of parliament  The Supreme Court was moved to Islamabad in 1965 and Chief Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius re located the entire judicial arbiter  personnel and high profile cases in Islamabad  The Supreme Court building is one of the most attractive places in Islamabad  yet the most largely beautiful building in the state capital   This provisional parliament had no lasting effects of West Pakistan s affairs but it was a ceremonial legislature where the law makers would gather around to discuss non political matters  In 1965  the legislative parliament was moved to Islamabad after Ayub Khan built a massive capitol  The assembly was renamed as the Parliament of Pakistan and staffed only with technocrats   2 2  Governor and chief minister  The office of Governor of West Pakistan was a largely ceremonial position but later Governors wielded some executive powers as well  The first Governor was Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani  who was also the last Governor of West Punjab  Ayub Khan abolished the Governor s office and instead established the Martial Law Administrator of West Pakistan  MLA West    The office Chief Minister of West Pakistan was the chief executive of the state and the leader of the largest party in the provincial assembly  The first Chief Minister was Abdul Jabbar Khan who had served twice as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province prior to independence  The office of Chief Minister was abolished in 1958 when Ayub Khan took over the administration of West Pakistan   2 2 1  Governors of West Pakistan  2 2 2  Chief Ministers of West Pakistan  2 3  Local government  The twelve divisions of West Pakistan province were Bahawalpur  Dera Ismail Khan  Hyderabad  Kalat  Khairpur  Lahore  Malakand  Multan  Peshawar  Quetta  Rawalpindi  and Sargodha  all named after their capitals except the capital of Malakand was Saidu  and Rawalpindi was administered from Islamabad  The province also incorporated the former Omani enclave of Gwadar following its purchase in 1958  and the former Federal Capital Territory  Karachi  in 1961  the latter forming a new division in its own right   In 1970  the Martial law office was dissolved by General Yahya Khan who disestablished the state of West Pakistan  On 1 July 1970  the of Balochistan  Punjab  Sindh  and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Office of Prime minister  and much of the civil institutions were revived and re established by the decree signed by General Yahya Khan  The four provinces and four administrative units retained their current status and local governments were constitutionally established in 1970 to manage and administer the provisional autonomy given to the provinces in 1970   3  Domestic affairs  3 1  Position toward East Pakistan  During West Pakistan s conflict with India  East Pakistan s military government remained silent and did not send any troops to exert pressure on Eastern India  West Pakistan accused East Pakistan of not taking any action  and their inaction caused West Pakistani resentment against East Pakistan s government  In fact  the Indian Air Force Eastern Air Command attacked East Pakistan s Air Force  However  East Pakistan was defended only by the under strength 14th Infantry Division and sixteen fighter jets  no tanks and no navy were established in East Pakistan   3 2  Days of disintegration  The One Unit policy was regarded as a rational administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and eliminate provincial prejudices  West Pakistan formed a seemingly homogeneous block  but in reality it comprised marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions  The four provinces did not quite fit official definitions of a single nation   The Sindhi and Urdu speaking class in Sindh Province revolted against the One Unit policy  The violence spread to Balochistan Province  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Province  The One Unit policy was a failure in West Pakistan  and its survival was seen as improbable  However  with the military coup of 1958  trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan   3 3  Influence of socialism  Due to West Pakistan s close relations with the United States and the capitalist states  the influence of socialism had far more deeper roots in the West Pakistan population  The population favoured socialism but never allied with communism  The Pakistan Socialist Party had previously lost support due to its anti Pakistan clauses during the time of the pre independence movement  However  despite initiatives to improve the population during the Ayub Khan s government  the poor masses did not enjoy the benefits and reforms that were enjoyed by the middle and gentry classes of Pakistan   After the Indo Pakistani war of 1965  the cultural revolution  resentment  hostility towards the government began to arise when the population felt that  Kashmir cause  was betrayed by President Ayub Khan  Problems further mounted after Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sacked and vowed to take a revenge  After gathering and uniting the scattered democratic socialist and Marxist masses  Bhutto founded the Pakistan Peoples Party in 1967  The socialists tapped a wave of antipathy against the United States allied president  The socialists integrated in poor and urban provinces of West Pakistan  educating people to cast their vote for their better future  and the importance of democracy was widely sensed in the entire country  The socialists  under Bhutto s guidance and leadership  played a vital role in managing labour strikes and civil disobedience to challenge Khan s authority  The military government responded fiercely after arresting the senior socialists  leadership  notably Bhutto  Mubashir Hassan  and Malick Mirage  This sparked gruesome violence in West Pakistan  thereby increasing pressure on Khan that he was unable to endure  Khan called for a Round Table Conference in Rawalpindi  but socialists led by Bhutto refused to accept Ayub s continuation in office and rejected the 6 Point Movement for regional autonomy put forth in 1966 by East Pakistani politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman   In 1969  Khan handed over power to Army Chief of Staff General Yahya Khan  who promised to hold elections within two years  Meantime  Bhutto extensively worked to gather and unite the country s left wing organisations  which  under Bhutto s leadership  participated with full force and became vital players in the country s politics   4  Foreign relations  4 1  Afghanistan  The long border between Afghanistan and West Pakistan was uneasy  This is due in part to the independent Pashtun tribes that inhabit the area  In addition  the physical boundary is uncertain  the 1893 Durand Line was used by West Pakistan to mark the border between the two countries  but Afghanistan has never recognised that frontier   In 1955  diplomatic relations were severed with the ransacking of Pakistan s embassy  In 1961  Pakistan Armed Forces suppressed an Afghan invasion in the Bajaur region of Pakistan   4 2  India  West Pakistan had hostile relations with India  primarily due to aftermaths of the 1947 independence and the issue of Kashmir   In 1947  the Pakistan army and air force attempted to annexe Kashmir  but were pushed back by the Indian army  Although the operation was a failure  it did occupy 40% of Kashmir  which was later integrated into Northern Pakistan   In 1965   Operation Gibraltar  had long ranging negative effects  outside and inside the country  Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Defence minister Vice Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan approached President Ayub Khan for approval of a covert operation to infiltrate Indian held Kashmir using airborne troops from the Pakistan army  Special Service Group  and Pakistan air force  Special Service Wing   During nights in August 1965  airborne troops parachuted into Indian Kashmir whilst ground assault began by Pakistan Army s troops  The airborne troops managed to occupy much of Indian held Kashmir and were only 6 miles  10 km  from Srinagar  but this was the closest Pakistani troops ever got to capturing the city  In September 1965  India launched a counter attack and the airborne troops were pushed back to Azad Kashmir Province  The operation failed brutally  and Indian Armed Forces attacked West Pakistan with full force  The Soviet Union intervened in the conflict in September 1965  for fear of escalation   and the month–long war ended with no permanent territorial changes  West Pakistan and India signed the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966  but the ceasefire was criticised both in India and Pakistan  and public resentment against each other grew  In West Pakistan  Ayub Khan deposed Bhutto as his Foreign minister  and Vice Admiral Khan blamed Bhutto for the operation s failure  As an aftermath  Bhutto tapped into an anti Ayub Khan movement and kicked off a storm of civil disobedience  Protests and spontaneous demonstrations broke out around the country  and Ayub Khan lost the control  In 1967  another martial law was imposed by another Army Commander in Chief  General Yahya Khan  who designated himself as the Chief Martial Law Administrator   4 3  People s Republic of China  West Pakistan had positive relations with the People s Republic of China  with whom it shared a small northern border   In 1950  Pakistan was among the first countries to end official diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese Republic of China and recognise the PRC  After that  both countries maintained an extremely close and supportive relationship  The PRC provided economic  military and technical assistance to Pakistan during the Cold War  and the two countries considered each other to be close strategic allies   4 4  Soviet Union  Relations varied from cool to extremely strained between West Pakistan and the Soviet Union  This was during the Cold War  and Pakistan s close ties with the United States came at the expense of relations with the Soviets   Soviet Pakistan relations were further eroded during the 1960 U 2 incident  when the Soviets shot down a US spyplane  Army Chief of Staff Ayub Khan had given the US permission to fly out of Peshawar Air Station on reconnaissance and covert surveillance missions over the Soviet Union   The USSR backed India during the Indo Pakistani War of 1971  The Soviets were the biggest supplier of military hardware to India at that time   4 5  United States  The United States was one of the first nations who   to establish relations with Pakistan upon its independence   Pakistan was allied with the US during the Cold war against the USSR  Pakistan was an integral member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization  SEATO  and the Central Treaty Organization  CENTO   both alliances opposed to the Soviet Union and communism   A major factor in Pakistan s decision to ally with the West was their urgent need for aid  In the years that followed  the US supplied extensive economic  scientific  and military assistance to Pakistan   This close relationship continued through Pakistan s years of democracy and military rule  Relations only soured after West Pakistan had dissolved into Pakistan  when the left oriented Pakistan Peoples Party came to power in 1971   5  See also  East Pakistan  Indo Pakistani War of 1971
