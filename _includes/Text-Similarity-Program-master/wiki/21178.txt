Non cognitivism is the meta ethical view that ethical sentences do not express propositions  i e  statements  and thus cannot be true or false  they are not truth apt   A noncognitivist denies the cognitivist claim that  moral judgments are capable of being objectively true  because they describe some feature of the world   If moral statements cannot be true  and if one cannot know something that is not true  noncognitivism implies that moral knowledge is impossible   Non cognitivism entails that non cognitive attitudes underlie moral discourse and this discourse therefore consists of non declarative speech acts  although accepting that its surface features may consistently and efficiently work as if moral discourse were cognitive  The point of interpreting moral claims as non declarative speech acts is to explain what moral claims mean if they are neither true nor false  as philosophies such as logical positivism entail   Utterances like  Boo to killing   and  Don t kill  are not candidates for truth or falsity  but have non cognitive meaning   1  Varieties of non cognitivism  Emotivism  associated with A  J  Ayer  the Vienna Circle and C  L  Stevenson  suggests that ethical sentences are primarily emotional expressions of one s own attitudes and are intended to influence the actions of the listener  Under this view   Killing is wrong  is translated as  Killing  boo   or  I disapprove of killing    A close cousin of emotivism  developed by R  M  Hare  is called universal prescriptivism  Prescriptivists interpret ethical statements as being universal imperatives  prescribing behavior for all to follow  According to prescriptivism  phrases like  Thou shalt not murder   or  Do not steal   are the clearest expressions of morality  while reformulations like  Killing is wrong  tend to obscure the meaning of moral sentences   Other forms of non cognitivism include Simon Blackburn s quasi realism and Allan Gibbard s norm expressivism   2  Arguments in favour of non cognitivism  Arguments for prescriptivism focus on the function of normative statements   Prescriptivists argue that factual statements and prescriptions are totally different  because of different expectations of change in cases of a clash between word and world  In a descriptive sentence  if one premises that  red is a number  then according to the rules of English grammar said statement would be false  Since said premise describes the objects  red  and  number   anyone with an adequate understanding of English would notice the falseness of such description and the falseness of said statement  However  if the norm  thou shalt not kill   is uttered  and this premise is negated  by the fact of a person being murdered   the speaker is not to change his sentence upon observation of this into  kill other people    but is to reiterate the moral outrage of the act of killing  Adjusting statements based upon objective reality and adjusting reality based upon statements are contrary uses of language  so descriptive statement are a different kind of sentences than norms  If truth is understood according to correspondence theory  the question of the truth or falsity of sentences not contingent upon external phenomena cannot be tested  see tautologies     Some cognitivists argue that some expressions like  courageous  have both a factual as well as a normative component which cannot be distinguished by analysis  Prescriptivists argue that according to context  either the factual or the normative component of the meaning is dominant  The sentence  Hero A behaved courageously  is wrong  if A ran away in the face of danger  But the sentence  Be brave and fight for the glory of your country   has no truth value and cannot be falsified by someone who doesn t join the army   Prescriptivism is also supported by the actual way of speaking  Many moral statements are de facto uttered as recommendations or commands  e g  when parents or teachers forbid children to do wrong actions  The most famous moral ideas are prescriptions  the Ten Commandments  the command of charity  the categorical imperative  and the Golden Rule command to do or not to do something rather than state that something is or is not the case   Prescriptivism can fit the theist idea of morality as obedience towards god  It is however different from the cognitivist supernaturalism which interprets morality as subjective will of god  while prescriptivism claims that moral rules are universal and can be found by reason alone without reference to a god   According to Hare  prescriptivists cannot argue that amoralists are logically wrong or contradictive  Everyone can choose to follow moral commands or not  This is the human condition according to the Christian reinterpretation of the Choice of Heracles  According to prescriptivism  morality is not about knowledge  of moral facts   but about character  to choose to do the right thing   Actors cannot externalize their responsibility and freedom of will towards some moral truth in the world  virtuous people don t need to wait for some cognition to choose what s right   Prescriptivism is also supported by imperative logic  in which there are no truth values for imperatives  and by the idea of the naturalistic fallacy  even if someone could prove the existence of an ethical property and express it in a factual statement  he could never derive any command from this statement  so the search for ethical properties is pointless   As with other anti realist meta ethical theories  non cognitivism is largely supported by the argument from queerness  ethical properties  if they existed  would be different from any other thing in the universe  since they have no observable effect on the world  People generally have a negative attitude towards murder  which presumably keeps most of us from murdering  But does the actual wrongness of murder play an independent role  Is there any evidence that there is a property of wrongness that some types of acts have  Some people might think that the strong feelings we have when we see or consider a murder provide evidence of murder s wrongness  But it is not difficult to explain these feelings without saying that wrongness was their cause  Thus there is no way of discerning which  if any  ethical properties exist  by Occam s Razor  the simplest assumption is that none do  The non cognitivist then asserts that  since a proposition about an ethical property would have no referent  ethical statements must be something else   Arguments for emotivism focus on what normative statements express when uttered by a speaker  A person who says that killing is wrong certainly expresses her disapproval of killing  Emotivists claim that this is all she does  that the statement  killing is wrong  is not a truth apt declaration  and that the burden of evidence is on the cognitivists who want to show that in addition to expressing disapproval  the claim  killing is wrong  is also true  Emotivists ask whether there really is evidence that killing is wrong  We have evidence that Jupiter has a magnetic field and that birds are oviparous  but as yet  we do not seem to have found evidence of moral properties  such as  goodness   Emotivists ask why  without such evidence  we should think there is such a property  Ethical intuitionists think the evidence comes not from science or reason but from our own feelings  good deeds make us feel a certain way and bad deeds make us feel very differently  But is this enough to show that there are genuinely good and bad deeds  Emotivists think not  claiming that we do not need to postulate the existence of moral  badness  or  wrongness  to explain why considering certain deeds makes us feel disapproval  that all we really observe when we introspect are feelings of disapproval  Thus the emotivist asks why not adopt the simple explanation and say that this is all there is  rather than insist that some intrinsic  badness   of murder  for example  must be causing feelings when a simpler explanation is available   3  Arguments against non cognitivism  One argument against non cognitivism is that it ignores the external causes of emotional and prescriptive reactions  If someone says   John is a good person   something about John must have inspired that reaction  If John gives to the poor  takes care of his sick grandmother  and is friendly to others  and these are what inspire the speaker to think well of him  it is plausible to say   John is a good person because he gives to the poor  takes care of his sick grandmother  and is friendly to others   If  in turn  the speaker responds positively to the idea of giving to the poor  then some aspect of that idea must have inspired a positive response  one could argue that that aspect is also the basis of its goodness   Another argument is the  embedding problem   Consider the following sentences   Eating meat is not wrong   Is eating meat wrong   I think that eating meat is wrong   Mike doesn t think that eating meat is wrong   I once thought that eating meat was wrong   She does not realize that eating meat is wrong  Attempts to translate these sentences in an emotivist framework seem to fail  e g   She does not realize   Boo on eating meat      Prescriptivist translations fare only slightly better   She does not realize that she is not to eat meat    Even the act of forming such a construction indicates some sort of cognition in the process   According to some non cognitivist points of view  these sentences simply assume the false premise that ethical statements are either true or false  They might be literally translated as    Eating meat is wrong  is a false statement   Is  eating meat is wrong  a true statement   I think that  eating meat is wrong  is a true statement   Mike doesn t think that  eating meat is wrong  is a true statement   I once thought that  eating meat is wrong  was a true statement   She does not realize that  eating meat is wrong  is a true statement  These translations  however  seem divorced from the way people actually use language  A non cognitivist would have to disagree with someone saying    Eating meat is wrong  is a false statement   since  Eating meat is wrong  is not truth apt at all   but may be tempted to agree with a person saying   Eating meat is not wrong    One might more constructively interpret these statements to describe the underlying emotional statement that they express  i e   I disapprove do not disapprove of eating meat  I used to  he doesn t  I do and she doesn t  etc   however  this interpretation is closer to ethical subjectivism than to non cognitivism proper   A similar argument against non cognitivism is that of ethical argument  A common argument might be   If killing an innocent human is always wrong  and all fetuses are innocent humans  then killing a fetus is always wrong   Most people would consider such an utterance to represent an analytic proposition which is true a priori  However  if ethical statements do not represent cognitions  it seems odd to use them as premises in an argument  and even odder to assume they follow the same rules of syllogism as true propositions  However  R M  Hare  proponent of universal prescriptivism  has argued that the rules of logic are independent of grammatical mood  and thus the same logical relations may hold between imperatives as hold between indicatives   Many objections to non cognitivism based on the linguistic characteristics of what purport to be moral judgments were originally raised by Peter Glassen in  The Cognitivity of Moral Judgments   published in Mind in January 1959  and in Glassen s follow up article in the January 1963 issue of the same journal   4  See also  Amoralism  Expressivism  Theological noncognitivism  Moral skepticism  Rudolf Carnap  Richard Rorty  5  References  6  External
