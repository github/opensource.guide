Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net  Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team s court under organized rules  It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964   The complete rules are extensive  But simply  play proceeds as follows  a player on one of the teams begins a  rally  by serving the ball  tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm   from behind the back boundary line of the court  over the net  and into the receiving team s court  The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court  The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively  Typically  the first two touches are used to set up for an attack  an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court   The rally continues  with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches  until either  1   a team makes a kill  grounding the ball on the opponent s court and winning the rally  or  2   a team commits a fault and loses the rally  The team that wins the rally is awarded a point  and serves the ball to start the next rally  A few of the most common faults include   causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents  court or without first passing over the net   catching and throwing the ball   double hit  two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player   four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team   net foul  touching the net during play   foot fault  the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving  The ball is usually played with the hands or arms  but players can legally strike or push  short contact  the ball with any part of the body   A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball  including spiking and blocking  because these plays are made above the top of the net  the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport  as well as passing  setting  and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures   1  History  1 1  Origin of volleyball  On February 9  1895  in Holyoke  Massachusetts  USA   William G  Morgan  a YMCA physical education director  created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played  preferably  indoors and by any number of players  The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball  Another indoor sport  basketball  was catching on in the area  having been invented just ten miles  sixteen kilometers  away in the city of Springfield  Massachusetts  only four years before  Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport  less rough than basketball  for older members of the YMCA  while still requiring a bit of athletic effort   The first rules  written down by William G Morgan  called for a net high  a court  and any number of players  A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning  and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents’ court  In case of a serving error  a second try was allowed  Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul  with loss of the point or a side out —except in the case of the first try serve   After an observer  Alfred Halstead  noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896  played at the International YMCA Training School  now called Springfield College   the game quickly became known as volleyball  it was originally spelled as two words   volley ball    Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs   1 2  Refinements and later developments  The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed  some sources say that Spalding created the first official ball in 1896  while others claim it was created in 1900  The rules evolved over time  in the Philippines by 1916  the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced  and four years later a  three hits  rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established  In 1917  the game was changed from 21 to 15 points  In 1919  about 16 000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies  which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries   The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900  An international federation  the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball  FIVB   was founded in 1947  and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women  The sport is now popular in Brazil  in Europe  where especially Italy  the Netherlands  and countries from Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s   in Russia  and in other countries including China and the rest of Asia  as well as in the United States  Beach volleyball  a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team  became a FIVB endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics  Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled   Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s  By the 1960s  a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist naturist clubs   1 3  Volleyball in the Olympics  The history of Olympic volleyball traces back to the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris  where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event  After the foundation of FIVB and some continental confederations  it began to be considered for official inclusion  In 1957  a special tournament was held at the 53rd IOC session in Sofia  Bulgaria to support such request  The competition was a success  and the sport was officially included in the program for the 1964 Summer Olympics   The Olympic volleyball tournament was originally a simple competition  all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by wins  set average  and point average  One disadvantage of this round robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games  making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches  To cope with this situation  the competition was split into two phases with the addition of a  final round  elimination tournament consisting of quarterfinals  semifinals  and finals matches in 1972  The number of teams involved in the Olympic tournament has grown steadily since 1964  Since 1996  both men s and women s events count twelve participant nations  Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games   The U S S R  won men s gold in both 1964 and 1968  After taking bronze in 1964 and silver in 1968  Japan finally won the gold for men s volleyball in 1972  Women s gold went to Japan in 1964 and again in 1976  That year  the introduction of a new offensive skill  the backrow attack  allowed Poland to win the men s competition over the Soviets in a very tight five set match  Since the strongest teams in men s volleyball at the time belonged to the Eastern Bloc  the American led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women s  The U S S R  collected their third Olympic Gold Medal in men s volleyball with a 3–1 victory over Bulgaria  the Soviet women won that year as well  their third gold as well   With the U S S R  boycotting the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles  the U S  was able to sweep Brazil in the finals to win the men s gold medal  Italy won its first medal  bronze in the men s competition  in 1984  foreshadowing a rise in prominence for their volleyball teams  The 1984 women s tournament was also won by a rising force  China   At the 1988 Games  Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons led the U S  men s team to a second straight gold medal  and the Soviets won the fourth gold in the women s tournament  In 1992  underrated Brazil upset favourites C I S   Netherlands  and Italy in the men s competition for the country s first volleyball Olympic gold medal  Runner up Netherlands  men s silver medalist in 1992  came back under team leaders Ron Zwerver and Olof van der Meulen in the 1996 Games for a five set win over Italy  A men s bronze medalist in 1996  Serbia and Montenegro  playing in 1996 and 2000 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  beat Russia in the gold medal match in 2000  winning their first gold medal ever  In all three games the strong Cuban female team lead by Regla Torres and Mireya Luis won the Gold medal  In 2004  Brazil won its second men s volleyball gold medal beating Italy in the finals  while China beat Russia for its second women s title  In the 2008 Games  the USA beat Brazil in the men s volleyball final  Brazil was runner up again at the 2012 Summer Olympics  this time losing to Russia after losing two match points in the third set  In both games Brazil s women team beat the United States for the gold medal   2  Rules of the game  2 1  The court dimensions  A volleyball court is long and wide  divided into 9 m × 9 m halves by a one meter  40 inch  wide net  The top of the net is above the center of the court for men s competition  and for women s competition  varied for veterans and junior competitions   The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is   although a clearance of is recommended   A line from and parallel to the net is considered the  attack line   This  3 meter   or  10 foot   line divides the court into  back row  and  front row  areas  also back court and front court   These are in turn divided into 3 areas each  these are numbered as follows  starting from area  1   which is the position of the serving player   After a team gains the serve  also known as siding out   its members must rotate in a clockwise direction  with the player previously in area  2  moving to area  1  and so on  with the player from area  1  moving to area  6    The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball  All lines denoting the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are therefore a part of the court or zone  If a ball comes in contact with the line  the ball is considered to be  in   An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court  A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the antenna  or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling  without contacting them   2 2  The ball  FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical  made of leather or synthetic leather  have a circumference of 65–67 cm  a weight of 260–280 g and an inside pressure of 0 30–0 325 kg cm2  Other governing bodies have similar regulations   2 3  Game play  Each team consists of six players  To get play started  a team is chosen to serve by coin toss  A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team s court  the serve   The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent s side of the net  These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball s trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter  second of the set  usually an over hand pass using wrists to push finger tips at the ball  by the setter so that the ball s trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it  and third by the attacker who spikes  jumping  raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent s court  to return the ball over the net  The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense   The team on defense attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court  players at the net jump and reach above the top  and if possible  across the plane  of the net to block the attacked ball  If the ball is hit around  above  or through the block  the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig  usually a fore arm pass of a hard driven ball   After a successful dig  the team transitions to offense   The game continues in this manner  rallying back and forth  until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made  The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches  or to cause the ball to land outside the court  A ball is  in  if any part of it touches a sideline or end line  and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may actually be in  Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end line in the air   Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession  a player  catching  the ball  a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball  or a player penetrating under the net into the opponent s court  There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules  although most of them are infrequent occurrences  These errors include back row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking  back row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line   players not being in the correct position when the ball is served  attacking the serve in the front court and above the height of the net  using another player as a source of support to reach the ball  stepping over the back boundary line when serving  taking more than 8 seconds to serve  or playing the ball when it is above the opponent s court   2 4  Scoring  When the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or an error is made  the team that did not make the error is awarded a point  whether they served the ball or not  If the ball hits the line  the ball is counted as in  The team that won the point serves for the next point  If the team that won the point served in the previous point  the same player serves again  If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point  the players of the serving team rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner  The game continues  with the first team to score 25 points by a two point margin is awarded the set  Matches are best of five sets and the fifth set  if necessary  is usually played to 15 points   Scoring differs between leagues  tournaments  and levels  high schools sometimes play best of three to 25  in the NCAA matches are played best of five to 25 as of the 2008 season    Before 1999  points could be scored only when a team had the serve  side out scoring  and all sets went up to only 15 points  The FIVB changed the rules in 1999  with the changes being compulsory in 2000  to use the current scoring system  formerly known as rally point system   primarily to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator  and television friendly   The final year of side out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women s Volleyball Championship was 2000  Rally point scoring debuted in 2001 and games were played to 30 points through 2007  For the 2008 season  games were renamed  sets  and reduced to 25 points to win   2 5  Libero  In 1998 the libero player was introduced internationally  The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills  the libero must wear a contrasting jersey color from his or her teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is entirely above net height  When the ball is not in play  the libero can replace any back row player  without prior notice to the officials  This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set  although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced   The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions  If she he makes an overhand set  she he must be standing behind  and not stepping on  the 3 meter line  otherwise  the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3 meter line  An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court   The libero is  generally  the most skilled defensive player on the team  There is also a libero tracking sheet  where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for  There may only be one libero per set  game   although there may be a different libero in the beginning of any new set  game    Furthermore  a libero is not allowed to serve  according to international rules  with the exception of the NCAA women s volleyball games  where a 2004 rule change allows the libero to serve  but only in a specific rotation  That is  the libero can only serve for one person  not for all of the people for whom she goes in  That rule change was also applied to high school and junior high play soon after   2 6  Recent rule changes  Other rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net  as long as it goes over the net into the opponents  court  Also  the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines  Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double touches  such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player   double hits   on a team s first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball   In 2008  the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women s volleyball  men s volleyball remained at 30   If a fifth  deciding  set is reached  the minimum required score remains at 15  In addition  the word  game  is now referred to as  set    Changes in rules have been studied and announced by the FIVB in recent years  and they have released the updated rules in 2009   3  Skills  Competitive teams master six basic skills  serve  pass  set  attack  block and dig  Each of these skills comprises a number of specific techniques that have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high level volleyball   3 1  Serve  A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball  in an attempt to drive it into the opponent s court  His or her main objective is to make it land inside the court  it is also desirable to set the ball s direction  speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly  A serve is called an  ace  when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after being touched by an opponent   In contemporary volleyball  many types of serves are employed   Underhand  a serve in which the player strikes the ball below the waist instead of tossing it up and striking it with an overhand throwing motion  Underhand serves are considered very easy to receive and are rarely employed in high level competitions   Sky ball serve  a specific type of underhand serve occasionally used in beach volleyball  where the ball is hit so high it comes down almost in a straight line  This serve was invented and employed almost exclusively by the Brazilian team in the early 1980s and is now considered outdated  In Brazil  this serve is called Jornada nas Estrelas  Star Trek    Topspin  an overhand serve where the player tosses the ball high and hits it with a wrist span  giving it topspin which causes it to drop faster than it would otherwise and helps maintain a straight flight path  Topspin serves are generally hit hard and aimed at a specific returner or part of the court  Standing topspin serves are rarely used above the high school level of play   Float  an overhand serve where the ball is hit with no spin so that its path becomes unpredictable  akin to a knuckleball in baseball   Jump serve  an overhand serve where the ball is first tossed high in the air  then the player makes a timed approach and jumps to make contact with the ball  hitting it with much pace and topspin  This is the most popular serve amongst college and professional teams   Jump float  an overhand serve where the ball is tossed high enough that the player may jump before hitting it similarly to a standing float serve  The ball is tossed lower than a topspin jump serve  but contact is still made while in the air  This serve is becoming more popular amongst college and professional players because it has a certain unpredictability in its flight pattern   3 2  Pass  Also called reception  the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent s serve  or any form of attack  Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court  but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely   The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques  underarm pass  or bump  where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform  at waist line  and overhand pass  where it is handled with the fingertips  like a set  above the head  Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball  however there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball   3 3  Set  The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball  The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent s court  The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team  and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball   As with passing  one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set  Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball  the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips  or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent  In the case of a set  one also speaks of a front or back set  meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter  There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net  In this case the setter usually jumps off his or her right foot straight up to avoid going into the net  The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left  the larger portion of net that he or she can see    Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent s court  This movement is called a  dump   This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row  otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack  The most common dumps are to  throw  the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4  More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit   3 4  Attack  The attack  also known as the spike  is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball  The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent s court and cannot be defended  A player makes a series of steps  the  approach    jumps  and swings at the ball   Ideally the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter s jump  At the moment of contact  the hitter s arm is fully extended above his or her head and slightly forward  making the highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit  The hitter uses arm swing  wrist snap  and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball  A  bounce  is a slang term for a very hard loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent s court and bounces very high into the air  A  kill  is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point   Contemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques   Backcourt  or backrow  pipe attack  an attack performed by a back row player  The player must jump from behind the 3 meter line before making contact with the ball  but may land in front of the 3 meter line   Line and Cross court Shot  refers to whether the ball flies in a straight trajectory parallel to the side lines  or crosses through the court in an angle  A cross court shot with a very pronounced angle  resulting in the ball landing near the 3 meter line  is called a cut shot   Dip Dink Tip Cheat Dump  the player does not try to make a hit  but touches the ball lightly  so that it lands on an area of the opponent s court that is not being covered by the defense   Tool Wipe Block abuse  the player does not try to make a hard spike  but hits the ball so that it touches the opponent s block and then bounces off court   Off speed hit  the player does not hit the ball hard  reducing its speed and thus confusing the opponent s defense   Quick hit  One   an attack  usually by the middle blocker  where the approach and jump begin before the setter contacts the ball  The set  called a  quick set   is placed only slightly above the net and the ball is struck by the hitter almost immediately after leaving the setter s hands  Quick attacks are often effective because they isolate the middle blocker to be the only blocker on the hit   Slide  a variation of the quick hit that uses a low back set  The middle hitter steps around the setter and hits from behind him or her   Double quick hit  Stack   Tandem   a variation of quick hit where two hitters  one in front and one behind the setter or both in front of the setter  jump to perform a quick hit at the same time  It can be used to deceive opposite blockers and free a fourth hitter attacking from backcourt  maybe without block at all   3 5  Block  Blocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent s attack   A block that is aimed at completely stopping an attack  thus making the ball remain in the opponent s court  is called offensive  A well executed offensive block is performed by jumping and reaching to penetrate with one s arms and hands over the net and into the opponent s area  It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place  It may also require calculating the best foot work to executing the  perfect  block   The jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball s trajectory prior to it crossing over the net  Palms are held deflected downward about 45–60 degrees toward the interior of the opponents court  A  roof  is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of the attack straight down to the attacker s floor  as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside of a peaked house roof   By contrast  it is called a defensive  or  soft  block if the goal is to control and deflect the hard driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes more easy to be defended  A well executed soft block is performed by jumping and placing one s hands above the net with no penetration into the opponent s court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backward   Blocking is also classified according to the number of players involved  Thus  one may speak of single  or solo   double  or triple block   Successful blocking does not always result in a  roof  and many times does not even touch the ball  While it s obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed  a block that consistently forces the attacker away from his or her  power  or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defense is also a highly successful block   At the same time  the block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking   3 6  Dig  Digging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one s court after a spike or attack  particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground  In many aspects  this skill is similar to passing  or bumping  overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms  It varies from passing however in that is it a much more reflex based skill  especially at the higher levels  It is especially important while digging for players to stay on their toes  several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they re ready to move in any direction   Some specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing  A player may sometimes perform a  dive   i e   throw his or her body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball  and land on his or her chest  When the player also slides his or her hand under a ball that is almost touching the court  this is called a  pancake   The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball  but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court limits the chances that the ball will make a good  clean contact with the hand  When used correctly  it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays   Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop his or her body quickly to the floor to save the ball  In this situation  the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries   4  Team play  Volleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next  with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball  These team movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system  offensive system  coverage system  and defensive system   The serve receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter  Systems can consist of 5 receivers  4 receivers  3 receivers  and in some cases 2 receivers  The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation  This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking   Offensive systems are the formations used by the offense to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court  or otherwise score points   Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization  see Player specialization  below   Popular formations include the 4 2  6 2  and 5 1 systems  see Formations  below   There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defense off balance   Coverage systems are the formations used by the offense to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack  Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball  players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court  Popular formations include the 2 3 system and the 1 2 2 system  In lieu of a system  some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter   Defensive systems are the formations used by the defense to protect against the ball being grounded into their court by the opposing team  The system will outline which players are responsible for which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from  Popular systems include the 6 Up  6 Back Deep  and 6 Back Slide defense  There are also several different blocking schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams offense   Some teams  when they are ready to serve  will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team  This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen  so the call is made at the referees discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receivers ability to pass the ball  The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible   5  Coaching  5 1  Basic  Coaching for volleyball can be classified under two main categories  match coaching and developmental coaching  The objective of match coaching is to win a match by managing a team s strategy  Developmental coaching emphasizes player development through the reinforcement of basic skills during exercises known as  drills   Drills promote repetition and refinement of volleyball movements  particularly in footwork patterns  body positioning relative to others  and ball contact  A coach will construct drills that simulate match situations thereby encouraging speed of movement  anticipation  timing  communication  and team work  At the various stages of a player s career  a coach will tailor drills to meet the strategic requirements of the team  The American Volleyball Coaches Association is the largest organization in the world dedicated exclusively to volleyball coaching   6  Strategy  6 1  Player specialization  There are 5 positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level  Setter  Outside Hitter Left Side Hitter  Middle Hitter  Opposite Hitter Right Side Hitter and Libero Defensive Specialist  Each of these positions plays a specific  key role in winning a volleyball match   Setters have the task for orchestrating the offense of the team  They aim for second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents  court for a point  They have to be able to operate with the hitters  manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set  Setters need to have swift and skillful appraisal and tactical accuracy  and must be quick at moving around the court   Liberos are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve  They are usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills  Libero means  free  in Italian—they receive this name as they have the ability to substitute for any other player on the court during each play  They do not necessarily need to be tall  as they never play at the net  which allows shorter players with strong passing and defensive skills to excel in the position and play an important role in the team s success  A player designated as a libero for a match may not play other roles during that match  Liberos wear a different color jersey than their teammates   Middle blockers or Middle hitters are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter  They are specialized in blocking  since they must attempt to stop equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of the court  In non beginners play  every team will have two middle hitters   Outside hitters or Left side hitters attack from near the left antenna  The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets  Inaccurate first passes usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite  Since most sets to the outside are high  the outside hitter may take a longer approach  always starting from outside the court sideline  In non beginners play  there are again two outside hitters on every team in every match   Opposite hitters or Right side hitters carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row  Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well formed block against the opponents  Outside Hitters and serve as a backup setter  Sets to the opposite usually go to the right side of the antennae  At some levels where substitutions are unlimited  teams will make use of a Defensive Specialist in place of or in addition to a Libero  This position does not have unique rules like the libero position  instead  these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules  A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side  but your team is already using a libero to take out your middles  Most often  the situation involves a team using a right side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they aren t able to effectively play back court defense  Similarly  teams might use a Serving Specialist to sub out a poor server situationally   6 2  Formations  The three standard volleyball formations are known as  4–2    6–2  and  5–1   which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively  4–2 is a basic formation used only in beginners  play  while 5–1 is by far the most common formation in high level play   6 2 1  4–2  The 4–2 formation has four hitters and two setters  The setters usually set from the middle front or right front position  The team will therefore have two front row attackers at all times  In the international 4–2  the setters set from the right front position  The international 4–2 translates more easily into other forms of offense   The setters line up opposite each other in the rotation  The typical lineup has two outside hitters  By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation  there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows  After service  the players in the front row move into their assigned positions  so that the setter is always in middle front  Alternatively  the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an outside attacker  the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter  allowing one of the other team s blockers to  cheat in  on a middle block   The clear disadvantage to this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers  leaving a team with fewer offensive weapons   Another aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force  albeit a weakened force  because when the setter is in the front court they are able to  tip  or  dump   so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch  the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand  This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack   6 2 2  6–2  In the 6–2 formation  a player always comes forward from the back row to set  The three front row players are all in attacking positions  Thus  all six players act as hitters at one time or another  while two can act as setters  So the 6–2 formation is actually a 4–2 system  but the back row setter penetrates to set   The 6–2 lineup thus requires two setters  who line up opposite to each other in the rotation  In addition to the setters  a typical lineup will have two middle hitters and two outside hitters  By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation  there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows  After service  the players in the front row move into their assigned positions   The advantage of the 6–2 is that there are always three front row hitters available  maximizing the offensive possibilities  However  not only does the 6–2 require a team to possess two people capable of performing the highly specialized role of setter  it also requires both of those players to be effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position  At the international level  only the Cuban National Women s Team employs this kind of formation  It is also used in Women s NCAA play  partially due to the variant rules used which allow 12 substitutions per set  as opposed to the 6 allowed in the standard rules    6 2 3  5–1  The 5–1 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of his or her position in the rotation  The team will therefore have three front row attackers when the setter is in the back row  and only two when the setter is in the front row  for a total of five possible attackers   The player opposite the setter in a 5–1 rotation is called the opposite hitter  In general  opposite hitters do not pass  they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving  The opposite hitter may be used as a third attack option  back row attack  when the setter is in the front row  this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams  Normally the opposite hitter is the most technical skilled hitter of the team  Back row attacks generally come from the back right position  known as zone 1  but are increasingly performed from back center in high level play   The big advantage of this system is that the setter always has 3 hitters to vary sets with  If the setter does this well  the opponent s middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker  increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point   There is another advantage  the same as that of a 4–2 formation  when the setter is a front row player  he or she is allowed to jump and  dump  the ball onto the opponent s side  This too can confuse the opponent s blocking players  the setter can jump and dump or can set to one of the hitters  A good setter knows this and thus won t only jump to dump or to set for a quick hit  but when setting outside as well to confuse the opponent   The 5–1 offense is actually a mix of 6–2 and 4–2  when the setter is in the front row  the offense looks like a 4–2  when the setter is in the back row  the offense looks like a 6–2   7  Variations and related games  There are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball  By far the most popular of these is beach volleyball  which is played on sand with two people per team  and rivals the main sport in popularity   Some games related to volleyball include   Beach volleyball  A game of indoor volleyball played with a beach ball instead of a volleyball   Buka ball  This is a rather similar game played only with the feet   Ecua volley  A variant invented in Ecuador  with some significant variants  such as number of players  and a heavier ball   Footvolley  A sport from Brazil in which the hands and arms are not used but most else is like beach volleyball   Hooverball  Popularized by President Herbert Hoover  it is played with a volleyball net and a medicine ball  it is scored like tennis  but the ball is caught and then thrown back  The weight of the medicine ball can make the sport to be quite physically demanding  annual championship tournaments are held annually in West Branch  Iowa   Newcomb ball  sometimes spelled  Nuke  Em    In this game  the ball is caught and thrown instead of hit  it rivaled volleyball in popularity until the 1920s   Prisoner Ball  Also played with volleyball court and a volleyball  prisoner ball is a variation of Newcomb ball where players are  taken prisoner  or released from  prison  instead of scoring points  Usually played by young children   Sepak Takraw  Played in Southeast Asia using a rattan ball and allowing only players  feet  knees  chest  and head to touch the ball   Throwball  became popular with women players at the YMCA College of Physical Education in Chennai  India  in the 1940s   Wallyball  A variation of volleyball played
