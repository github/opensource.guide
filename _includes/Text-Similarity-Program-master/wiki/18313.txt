Louis Armstrong  August 4  1901 – July 6  1971   nicknamed Satchmo or Pops  was an American jazz trumpeter  singer  and an influential figure in jazz music   Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an  inventive  trumpet and cornet player  Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz  shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance  With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice  Armstrong was also an influential singer  demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser  bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes  He was also skilled at scat singing  vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics    Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet playing  Armstrong s influence extends well beyond jazz music  and by the end of his career in the 1960s  he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general  Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African American entertainers to  cross over   whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided  He rarely publicly politicized his race  often to the dismay of fellow African Americans  but took a well publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis  His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for men of color   1  Early life  Armstrong often stated that he was born on July 4  1900  a date that has been noted in many biographies  Although he died in 1971  it was not until the mid 1980s that his true birth date of August 4  1901 was discovered by researcher Tad Jones through the examination of baptismal records  Armstrong was born into a very poor family in New Orleans  Louisiana  the grandson of slaves  He spent his youth in poverty  in a rough neighborhood  known as “the Battlefield”  which was part of the Storyville legal prostitution district  His father  William Armstrong  1881–1922   abandoned the family when Louis was an infant and took up with another woman  His mother  Mary  Mayann  Albert  1886–1927   then left Louis and his younger sister Beatrice Armstrong Collins  1903–1987  in the care of his grandmother  Josephine Armstrong  and at times  his Uncle Isaac  At five  he moved back to live with his mother and her relatives  and saw his father only in parades   He attended the Fisk School for Boys  where he likely had early exposure to music  He brought in some money as a paperboy and also by finding discarded food and selling it to restaurants  but it was not enough to keep his mother from prostitution  He hung out in dance halls close to home  where he observed everything from licentious dancing to the quadrille  For extra money he also hauled coal to Storyville  the famed red light district  and listened to the bands playing in the brothels and dance halls  especially Pete Lala s where Joe  King  Oliver performed and other famous musicians would drop in to jam   After dropping out of the Fisk School at age eleven  Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money  But he also started to get into trouble  Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong  then 11  to play by ear at Dago Tony s Tonk in New Orleans  although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver  Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but instead drew inspiration from it  “Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans    It has given me something to live for ”  He also worked for a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant family  the Karnofskys  who had a junk hauling business and gave him odd jobs  They took him in and treated him as almost a family member  knowing he lived without a father  and would feed and nurture him  He later wrote a memoir of his relationship with the Karnofskys titled  Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans  La   the Year of 1907  In it he describes his discovery that this family was also subject to discrimination by  other white folks  nationalities who felt that they were better than the Jewish race    I was only seven years old but I could easily see the ungodly treatment that the White Folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for   Armstrong wore a Star of David pendant for the rest of his life and wrote about what he learned from them   how to live—real life and determination   The influence of Karnofsky is remembered in New Orleans by the Karnofsky Project  a non profit organization dedicated to accepting donated musical instruments to  put them into the hands of an eager child who could not otherwise take part in a wonderful learning experience    Armstrong developed his cornet playing seriously in the band of the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs  where he had been sent multiple times for general delinquency  most notably for a long term after firing his stepfather s pistol into the air at a New Year s Eve celebration  as police records confirm  Professor Peter Davis  who frequently appeared at the Home at the request of its administrator  Captain Joseph Jones  instilled discipline in and provided musical training to the otherwise self taught Armstrong  Eventually  Davis made Armstrong the band leader  The Home band played around New Orleans and the thirteen year old Louis began to draw attention by his cornet playing  starting him on a musical career  At fourteen he was released from the Home  living again with his father and new stepmother and then back with his mother and also back to the streets and their temptations  Armstrong got his first dance hall job at Henry Ponce’s where Black Benny became his protector and guide  He hauled coal by day and played his cornet at night   He played in the city s frequent brass band parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got  learning from Bunk Johnson  Buddy Petit  Kid Ory  and above all  Joe  King  Oliver  who acted as a mentor and father figure to the young musician  Later  he played in the brass bands and riverboats of New Orleans  and began traveling with the well regarded band of Fate Marable  which toured on a steamboat up and down the Mississippi River  He described his time with Marable as  going to the University   since it gave him a much wider experience working with written arrangements   In 1919  Joe Oliver decided to go north and resigned his position in Kid Ory s band  Armstrong replaced him  He also became second trumpet for the Tuxedo Brass Band  a society band   2  Career  Through all his riverboat experience Armstrong’s musicianship began to mature and expand  At twenty  he could read music and he started to be featured in extended trumpet solos  one of the first jazzmen to do this  injecting his own personality and style into his solo turns  He had learned how to create a unique sound and also started using singing and patter in his performances  In 1922  Armstrong joined the exodus to Chicago  where he had been invited by his mentor  Joe  King  Oliver  to join his Creole Jazz Band and where he could make a sufficient income so that he no longer needed to supplement his music with day labor jobs  It was a boom time in Chicago and though race relations were poor  the “Windy City” was teeming with jobs for black people  who were making good wages in factories and had plenty to spend on entertainment   Oliver s band was the best and most influential hot jazz band in Chicago in the early 1920s  at a time when Chicago was the center of the jazz universe  Armstrong lived like a king in Chicago  in his own apartment with his own private bath  his first   Excited as he was to be in Chicago  he began his career long pastime of writing nostalgic letters to friends in New Orleans  As Armstrong’s reputation grew  he was challenged to “cutting contests” by hornmen trying to displace the new phenom  who could blow two hundred high C’s in a row  Armstrong made his first recordings on the Gennett and Okeh labels  jazz records were starting to boom across the country   including taking some solos and breaks  while playing second cornet in Oliver s band in 1923  At this time  he met Hoagy Carmichael  with whom he would collaborate later  who was introduced by friend Bix Beiderbecke  who now had his own Chicago band   Armstrong enjoyed working with Oliver  but Louis  second wife  pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong  urged him to seek more prominent billing and develop his newer style away from the influence of Oliver  Armstrong took the advice of his wife and left Oliver s band  For a year Armstrong played in Fletcher Henderson s band in New York on many recordings  After playing in New York  Armstrong returned to Chicago  playing in large orchestras  there he created his most important early recordings  Lil had her husband play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skill and improve his solo play and she prodded him into wearing more stylish attire to make him look sharp and to better offset his growing girth  Lil’s influence eventually undermined Armstrong’s relationship with his mentor  especially concerning his salary and additional moneys that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members  Armstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924  Shortly afterward  Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra  the top African American band of the day  Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section  His influence upon Henderson s tenor sax soloist  Coleman Hawkins  can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period  Armstrong quickly adapted to the more tightly controlled style of Henderson  playing trumpet and even experimenting with the trombone and the other members quickly took up Armstrong’s emotional  expressive pulse  Soon his act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters  especially preachers  The Henderson Orchestra was playing in the best venues for white only patrons  including the famed Roseland Ballroom  featuring the classy arrangements of Don Redman  Duke Ellington’s orchestra would go to Roseland to catch Armstrong’s performances and young hornmen around town tried in vain to outplay him  splitting their lips in their attempts   During this time  Armstrong made many recordings on the side  arranged by an old friend from New Orleans  pianist Clarence Williams  these included small jazz band sides with the Williams Blue Five  some of the best pairing Armstrong with one of Armstrong s few rivals in fiery technique and ideas  Sidney Bechet  and a series of accompaniments with blues singers  including Bessie Smith  Ma Rainey  and Alberta Hunter   Armstrong returned to Chicago in 1925 due mostly to the urging of his wife  who wanted to pump up Armstrong’s career and income  He was content in New York but later would concede that she was right and that the Henderson Orchestra was limiting his artistic growth  In publicity  much to his chagrin  she billed him as “the World’s Greatest Trumpet Player”  At first  he was actually a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife  He began recording under his own name for Okeh with his famous Hot Five and Hot Seven groups  producing hits such as  Potato Head Blues    Muggles    a reference to marijuana  for which Armstrong had a lifelong fondness   and  West End Blues   the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come   The group included Kid Ory  trombone   Johnny Dodds  clarinet   Johnny St  Cyr  banjo   wife Lil on piano  and usually no drummer  Armstrong’s bandleading style was easygoing  as St  Cyr noted   One felt so relaxed working with him  and he was very broad minded       always did his best to feature each individual   His recordings soon after with pianist Earl  Fatha  Hines  most famously their 1928 Weatherbird duet  and Armstrong s trumpet introduction to  West End Blues  remain some of the most famous and influential improvisations in jazz history  Armstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished  which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive  such as  whip that thing  Miss Lil  and  Mr  Johnny Dodds  Aw  do that clarinet  boy    Armstrong also played with Erskine Tate’s Little Symphony  actually a quintet  which played mostly at the Vendome Theatre  They furnished music for silent movies and live shows  including jazz versions of classical music  such as  Madame Butterfly   which gave Armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience  He began to scat sing  improvised vocal jazz using nonsensical words  and was among the first to record it  on  Heebie Jeebies  in 1926  The recording was so popular that the group became the most famous jazz band in the United States  even though they had not performed live to any great extent  Young musicians across the country  black or white  were turned on by Armstrong’s new type of jazz   After separating from Lil  Armstrong started to play at the Sunset Café for Al Capone s associate Joe Glaser in the Carroll Dickerson Orchestra  with Earl Hines on piano  which was soon renamed Louis Armstrong and his Stompers  though Hines was the music director and Glaser managed the orchestra  Hines and Armstrong became fast friends and successful collaborators   Armstrong returned to New York  in 1929  where he played in the pit orchestra of the successful musical Hot Chocolate  an all black revue written by Andy Razaf and pianist composer Fats Waller  He also made a cameo appearance as a vocalist  regularly stealing the show with his rendition of  Ain t Misbehavin    his version of the song becoming his biggest selling record to date   Armstrong started to work at Connie s Inn in Harlem  chief rival to the Cotton Club  a venue for elaborately staged floor shows  and a front for gangster Dutch Schultz  Armstrong also had considerable success with vocal recordings  including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend Hoagy Carmichael  His 1930s recordings took full advantage of the new RCA ribbon microphone  introduced in 1931  which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the  crooning  sound of artists like Bing Crosby  Armstrong s famous interpretation of Hoagy Carmichael s  Stardust  became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded  showcasing Armstrong s unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards   Armstrong s radical re working of Sidney Arodin and Carmichael s  Lazy River   recorded in 1931  encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing  The song begins with a brief trumpet solo  then the main melody is stated by sobbing horns  memorably punctuated by Armstrong s growling interjections at the end of each bar   Yeah      Uh huh      Sure       Way down  way down   In the first verse  he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo  pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing  In the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody  which then evolves into a classic passage of Armstrong  scat singing    As with his trumpet playing  Armstrong s vocal innovations served as a foundation stone for the art of jazz vocal interpretation  The uniquely gritty coloration of his voice became a musical archetype that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated  His scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist  His resonant  velvety lower register tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as  Lazy River  exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as Bing Crosby   The Great Depression of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene  The Cotton Club closed in 1936 after a long downward spiral  and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated  Bix Beiderbecke died and Fletcher Henderson’s band broke up  King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled  Sidney Bechet became a tailor and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens   Armstrong moved to Los Angeles in 1930 to seek new opportunities  He played at the New Cotton Club in Los Angeles with Lionel Hampton on drums  The band drew the Hollywood crowd  which could still afford a lavish night life  while radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home  Bing Crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club  In 1931  Armstrong appeared in his first movie  Ex Flame  Armstrong was convicted of marijuana possession but received a suspended sentence  He returned to Chicago in late 1931 and played in bands more in the Guy Lombardo vein and he recorded more standards  When the mob insisted that he get out of town  Armstrong visited New Orleans  got a hero’s welcome and saw old friends  He sponsored a local baseball team known as “Armstrong’s Secret Nine” and had a cigar named after him  But soon he was on the road again and after a tour across the country shadowed by the mob  Armstrong decided to go to Europe to escape   After returning to the United States  he undertook several exhausting tours  His agent Johnny Collins’ erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash  Breach of contract violations plagued him  Finally  he hired Joe Glaser as his new manager  a tough mob connected wheeler dealer  who began to straighten out his legal mess  his mob troubles  and his debts  Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips  which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style  As a result he branched out  developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances  He appeared in movies again  including Crosby s 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven  In 1937  Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network and became the first African American to host a sponsored  national broadcast   After spending many years on the road  Armstrong settled permanently in Queens  New York in 1943 in contentment with his fourth wife  Lucille  Although subject to the vicissitudes of Tin Pan Alley and the gangster ridden music business  as well as anti black prejudice  he continued to develop his playing  He recorded Hoagy Carmichael s Rockin  Chair for Okeh Records   During the subsequent thirty years  Armstrong played more than three hundred gigs a year  Bookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940s due to changes in public tastes  ballrooms closed  and there was competition from television and from other types of music becoming more popular than big band music  It became impossible under such circumstances to support and finance a 16 piece touring band   2 1  The All Stars  Following a highly successful small group jazz concert at New York Town Hall on May 17  1947  featuring Armstrong with trombonist singer Jack Teagarden  Armstrong s manager Joe Glaser dissolved the Armstrong big band on August 13  1947 and established a six piece small group featuring Armstrong with  initially  Teagarden  Earl Hines and other top swing and dixieland musicians  most of them ex big band leaders  The new group was announced at the opening of Billy Berg s Supper Club   This group was called Louis Armstrong and his All Stars and included at various times Earl  Fatha  Hines  Barney Bigard  Edmond Hall  Jack Teagarden  Trummy Young  Arvell Shaw  Billy Kyle  Marty Napoleon  Big Sid Catlett  Cozy Cole  Tyree Glenn  Barrett Deems  Joe Darensbourg and the Filipino American percussionist Danny Barcelona  During this period  Armstrong made many recordings and appeared in over thirty films  He was the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of Time Magazine on February 21  1949   In 1964  he recorded his biggest selling record   Hello  Dolly    a song by Jerry Herman  originally sung by Carol Channing  Armstrong s cover of the song  which lasted 22 weeks on the Hot 100  longer than any other record that year  went to No  1 on the pop chart  making Armstrong  age 62 years  9 months  5 days  the oldest person to date to ever accomplish that feat  In the process  Armstrong dislodged The Beatles from the No  1 position they had occupied for 14 consecutive weeks with three different songs   Armstrong kept up his busy tour schedule until a few years before his death in 1971  In his later years he would sometimes play some of his numerous gigs by rote  but other times would enliven the most mundane gig with his vigorous playing  often to the astonishment of his band  He also toured Africa  Europe  and Asia under sponsorship of the US State Department with great success  earning the nickname  Ambassador Satch   and inspiring Dave Brubeck to compose his jazz musical The Real Ambassadors  While failing health restricted his schedule in his last years  within those limitations he continued playing until the day he died   3  Death  Armstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6  1971  a month before his 70th birthday  11 months after playing a famous show at the Waldorf Astoria s Empire Room  He was residing in Corona  Queens  New York City  at the time of his death  He was interred in Flushing Cemetery  Flushing  in Queens  New York City  His honorary pallbearers included Bing Crosby  Ella Fitzgerald  Dizzy Gillespie  Pearl Bailey  Count Basie  Harry James  Frank Sinatra  Ed Sullivan  Earl Wilson  Alan King  Johnny Carson and David Frost  Peggy Lee sang The Lord s Prayer at the services while Al Hibbler sang  Nobody Knows the Trouble I ve Seen  and Fred Robbins  a long time friend  gave the eulogy   4  Personal life  4 1  Pronunciation of name  The Louis Armstrong House Museum website states   In a memoir written for Robert Goffin between 1943 and 1944  Armstrong states   All white folks call me Louie   suggesting that he himself did not  That said  Armstrong was registered as  Lewie  for the 1920 U S  Census  On various live records he s called  Louie  on stage  such as on the 1952  Can Anyone Explain   from the live album In Scandinavia vol 1  It should also be noted that  Lewie  is the French pronunciation of  Louis  and is commonly used in Louisiana   4 2  Family  On March 19  1918  Louis married Daisy Parker from Gretna  Louisiana  They adopted a 3 year old boy  Clarence Armstrong  whose mother  Louis  cousin Flora  died soon after giving birth  Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled  the result of a head injury at an early age  and Louis would spend the rest of his life taking care of him  Louis  marriage to Parker failed quickly and they separated in 1923  She died shortly after the divorce  On February 4  1924  Louis married Lil Hardin Armstrong  who was Oliver s pianist and had also divorced her first spouse only a few years earlier  His second wife was instrumental in developing his career  but in the late 1920s Hardin and Louis grew apart  They separated in 1931 and divorced in 1938  after which Louis married longtime girlfriend Alpha Smith  His marriage to his third wife lasted four years  and they divorced in 1942  Louis then married Lucille Wilson  a singer at the Cotton Club  to whom he was married until his death in 1971   Armstrong s marriages never produced any offspring though he loved children  However  in December 2012  57 year old Sharon Preston Folta claimed to be his daughter  from a 1950s affair between Armstrong and Lucille  Sweets  Preston  a dancer at the Cotton Club  In a 1955 letter to his manager  Joe Glaser  Armstrong affirmed his belief that Preston s newborn baby was his daughter  and ordered Glaser to pay a monthly allowance of $400 to mother and child   4 3  Personality  Armstrong was a colorful character  His own biography vexes biographers and historians  because he had a habit of telling tales  particularly of his early childhood  when he was less scrutinized  and his embellishments of his history often lack consistency   He was not only an entertainer  Armstrong was also a leading personality of the day  He was beloved by an American public that gave even the greatest African American performers little access beyond their public celebrity  and he was able to live a private life of access and privilege accorded to few other African Americans   He tried to remain politically neutral  which gave him a large part of that access  but often alienated him from members of the black community who looked to him to use his prominence with white America to become more of an outspoken figure during the Civil Rights Era of U S  history   4 4  Nicknames  The nicknames Satchmo and Satch are short for Satchelmouth  Like many things in Armstrong s life  which was filled with colorful stories both real and imagined  many of his own telling  the nickname has many possible origins   The most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy dancing for pennies in the streets of New Orleans  who would scoop up the coins off of the streets and stick them into his mouth to avoid having the bigger children steal them from him  Someone dubbed him  satchel mouth  for his mouth acting as a satchel  Another tale is that because of his large mouth  he was nicknamed  satchel mouth  which became shortened to Satchmo   Early on he was also known as Dipper  short for Dippermouth  a reference to the piece Dippermouth Blues  and something of a riff on his unusual embouchure   The nickname Pops came from Armstrong s own tendency to forget people s names and simply call them  pops  instead  The nickname was soon turned on Armstrong himself  It was used as the title of a 2010 biography of Armstrong by Terry Teachout   4 5  Armstrong and race  Armstrong was largely accepted into white society  both on stage and off  a privilege reserved for very few African American public figures  and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone  As his fame grew  so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to a black man  even a famous one  His renown was such that he dined in the best restaurants and stayed in hotels usually exclusively for whites   It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed  although he was very careful not to flaunt it with fellow performers of color  and privately  he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians   That still did not prevent members of the African American community  particularly in the late 1950s to the early 1970s  from calling him an Uncle Tom  a black on black racial epithet for someone who kowtowed to white society at the expense of their own racial identity  Billie Holiday countered  however   Of course Pops toms  but he toms from the heart    He was criticized for accepting the title of  King of The Zulus  for Mardi Gras in 1949  In the New Orleans African American community it is an honored role as the head of leading black Carnival Krewe  but bewildering or offensive to outsiders with their traditional costume of grass skirts and blackface makeup satirizing southern white attitudes   Some musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences  and for not taking a strong enough stand in the civil rights movement   The few exceptions made it more effective when he did speak out  Armstrong s criticism of President Eisenhower  calling him  two faced  and  gutless  because of his inaction during the conflict over school desegregation in Little Rock  Arkansas in 1957 made national news   As a protest  Armstrong canceled a planned tour of the Soviet Union on behalf of the State Department saying  The way they re treating my people in the South  the government can go to hell  and that he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people  Six days after Armstrong s comments  Eisenhower ordered Federal troops to Little Rock to escort students into the school   The FBI kept a file on Armstrong  for his outspokenness about integration   4 6  Religion  When asked about his religion  Armstrong would answer that he was raised a Baptist  always wore a Star of David  and was friends with the Pope  Armstrong wore the Star of David in honor of the Karnofsky family  who took him in as a child and lent him the money to buy his first cornet  Louis Armstrong was  in fact  baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans  and he met popes Pius XII and Paul VI  though there is no evidence that he considered himself Catholic  Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions  but also found humor in them   4 7  Personal habits  4 7 1  Purging  Armstrong was also greatly concerned with his health and bodily functions  He made frequent use of laxatives as a means of controlling his weight  a practice he advocated both to personal acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title Lose Weight the Satchmo Way  Armstrong s laxative of preference in his younger days was Pluto Water  but he then became an enthusiastic convert when he discovered the herbal remedy Swiss Kriss  He would extol its virtues to anyone who would listen and pass out packets to everyone he encountered  including members of the British Royal Family   Armstrong also appeared in humorous  albeit risqué  cards that he had printed to send out to friends  the cards bore a picture of him sitting on a toilet—as viewed through a keyhole—with the slogan  Satch says   Leave it all behind ya     The cards have sometimes been incorrectly described as ads for Swiss Kriss   In a live recording of  Baby  It s Cold Outside  with Velma Middleton  he changes the lyric from  Put another record on while I pour  to  Take some Swiss Kriss while I pour    4 7 2  Love of food  The concern with his health and weight was balanced by his love of food  reflected in such songs as  Cheesecake    Cornet Chop Suey   though  Struttin’ with Some Barbecue  was written about a fine looking companion  not about food  He kept a strong connection throughout his life to the cooking of New Orleans  always signing his letters   Red beans and ricely yours      4 8  Writings  Armstrong’s gregariousness extended to writing  On the road  he wrote constantly  sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world  He avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand  recording instant takes on music  sex  food  childhood memories  his heavy  medicinal  marijuana use—and even his bowel movements  which he gleefully described  He had a fondness for lewd jokes and dirty limericks as well   4 9  Social organizations  Louis Armstrong was not  as is often claimed  a Freemason  Although he is usually listed as being a member of Montgomery Lodge No  18  Prince Hall  in New York  no such lodge has ever existed  Armstrong states in his autobiography  however  that he was a member of the Knights of Pythias  which is not a Masonic group   5  Music  5 1  Horn playing and early jazz  In his early years  Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet  The greatest trumpet playing of his early years can be heard on his Hot Five and Hot Seven records  as well as the Red Onion Jazz Babies  Armstrong s improvisations were daring and sophisticated for the time  while often subtle and melodic   He often essentially re composed pop tunes he played  making them more interesting  Armstrong s playing is filled with original melodies  creative leaps  and subtle relaxed or driving rhythms  Armstrong s playing technique  honed by constant practice  extended the range  tone and capabilities of the trumpet  In these records  Armstrong almost single handedly created the role of the jazz soloist  taking what was essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression   Armstrong s work in the 1920s shows him playing at the outer limits of his abilities  The Hot Five records  especially  often have minor flubs and missed notes  which do little to detract from listening enjoyment since the energy of the spontaneous performance comes through  By the mid 1930s  Armstrong achieved a smooth assurance  knowing exactly what he could do and carrying out his ideas to perfection   He was one of the first artists to use recordings of his performances to improve himself  Armstrong was an avid audiophile  He had a large collection of recordings  including reel to reel tapes  which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career  He enjoyed listening to his own recordings  and comparing his performances musically  In the den of his home  he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio   5 2  Vocal popularity  As his music progressed and popularity grew  his singing also became very important  Armstrong was not the first to record scat singing  but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it  He had a hit with his playing and scat singing on  Heebie Jeebies  when  according to some legends  the sheet music fell on the floor and he simply started singing nonsense syllables  Armstrong stated in his memoirs that this actually occurred  He also sang out  I done forgot the words  in the middle of recording  I m A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas    Such records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances  Long before this  however  Armstrong was playing around with his vocals  shortening and lengthening phrases  interjecting improvisations  using his voice as creatively as his trumpet   5 3  Colleagues and followers  During his long career he played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time  among them were Bing Crosby  Duke Ellington  Fletcher Henderson  Earl Hines  the singing brakeman Jimmie Rodgers  Bessie Smith and perhaps most famously Ella Fitzgerald   His influence upon Bing Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music  Crosby admired and copied Armstrong  as is evident on many of his early recordings  notably  Just One More Chance   1931   The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz describes Crosby s debt to Armstrong in precise detail  although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name   Armstrong recorded two albums with Ella Fitzgerald  Ella and Louis  and Ella and Louis Again for Verve Records  with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the Oscar Peterson Trio and drummers Buddy Rich  on the first album   and Louie Bellson  on the second   Norman Granz then had the vision for Ella and Louis to record Porgy and Bess which is the most famous and critically acclaimed version of the Gerswhin brothers  masterpiece   His recordings for Columbia Records  Louis Armstrong Plays W C  Handy  1954  and Satch Plays Fats  all Fats Waller tunes   1955  were both being considered masterpieces  as well as moderately well selling  In 1961 the All Stars participated in two albums    The Great Summit  and  The Great Reunion   now together as a single disc  with Duke Ellington  The albums feature many of Ellington s most famous compositions  as well as two exclusive cuts  with Duke sitting in on piano  His participation in Dave Brubeck s high concept jazz musical The Real Ambassadors  1963  was critically acclaimed  and features  Summer Song   one of Armstrong s most popular vocal efforts   In 1964 his recording of the song  Hello Dolly  went to number one  An album of the same title was quickly created around the song  and also shot to number one  knocking The Beatles off the top of the chart   The album sold very well for the rest
