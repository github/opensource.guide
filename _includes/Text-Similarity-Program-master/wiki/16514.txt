Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm  4 January 1785 – 20 September 1863  was a German philologist  jurist and mythologist  He is known as the discoverer of Grimm s Law  linguistics   the author  with his brother Wilhelm  of the monumental Deutsches Wörterbuch  the author of Deutsche Mythologie and  more popularly  as one of the Brothers Grimm  as the editor of Grimm s Fairy Tales   1  Life and books  Jacob Grimm was born in Hanau  in Hesse Kassel  or Hesse Cassel   His father  who was a lawyer  died while he was a child  and his mother was left with very small means  but her sister  who was lady of the chamber to the Landgravine of Hesse  helped to support and educate her numerous family  Jacob  with his younger brother Wilhelm  born on 24 February 1786   was sent in 1798 to the public school at Kassel   In 1802 he proceeded to the University of Marburg  where he studied law  a profession for which he had been destined by his father  His brother joined him at Marburg a year later  having just recovered from a long and severe illness  and likewise began the study of law   Up to this time Jacob Grimm had been actuated only by a general thirst for knowledge and his energies had not found any aim beyond the practical one of making himself a position in life  The first definite impulse came from the lectures of Friedrich Karl von Savigny  the celebrated investigator of Roman law  who  as Wilhelm Grimm himself says in the preface to the Deutsche Grammatik  German Grammar   first taught him to realize what it meant to study any science  Savigny s lectures also awakened in him a love for historical and antiquarian investigation  which forms the structure of all his work  The two men became personally acquainted  and it was in Savigny s well stocked library that Grimm first turned over the leaves of Bodmer s edition of the Old German minnesingers and other early texts  and felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the obscurities and half revealed mysteries of their language   In the beginning of 1805 he received an invitation from Savigny  who had moved to Paris  to help him in his literary work  Grimm passed a very happy time in Paris  strengthening his taste for the literatures of the Middle Ages by his studies in the Paris libraries  Towards the close of the year he returned to Kassel  where his mother and Wilhelm had settled  the latter having finished his studies  The next year he obtained a position in the war office with the very small salary of 100 thalers  One of his grievances was that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail  But he had full leisure for the prosecution of his studies   In 1808  soon after the death of his mother  he was appointed superintendent of the private library of Jérôme Bonaparte  King of Westphalia  into which Hesse Kassel had been incorporated by Napoleon  Bonaparte appointed him an auditor to the state council  while Grimm retained his superintendent post  His salary was increased in a short period of time from 2000 to 4000 francs and his official duties were hardly more than nominal  After the expulsion of Bonaparte and the reinstatement of an elector  Grimm was appointed Secretary of Legation in 1813  accompanying the Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army  In 1814 he was sent to Paris to demand restitution of books carried off by the French  and he also attended the Congress of Vienna as Secretary of Legation  1814–1815  Upon his return from Vienna he was sent to Paris a second time to secure book restitutions  Meanwhile  Wilhelm had received an appointment to the Kassel library  and in 1816 Jacob was made second librarian under Volkel  Upon the death of Volkel in 1828  the brothers expected to be advanced to the first and second librarianships respectively  and were dissatisfied when the first place was given to Rommel  the keeper of the archives  Consequently  they moved the following year to Göttingen  where Jacob received the appointment of professor and librarian  and Wilhelm that of under librarian  Jacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities  historical grammar  literary history  and diplomatics  explained Old German poems  and commented on the Germania of Tacitus   During this period he is described as small and lively in figure  with a harsh voice  speaking a broad Hessian dialect  His powerful memory enabled him to dispense with the manuscript on which most German professors relied and he spoke extemporaneously  referring only occasionally to a few names and dates written on a slip of paper  He regretted that he had begun the work of teaching so late in life  but as a lecturer he was not successful  he had no aptitude for digesting facts and suiting them to the level of comprehension of his students   In 1837  having been one of the seven professors who signed a protest against the King of Hanover s abrogation of the constitution established some years before  he was dismissed from his professorship and banished from the Kingdom of Hanover  He returned to Kassel with his brother  who had also signed the protest  They remained there until 1840  when they accepted an invitation from the King of Prussia to move to Berlin  where they both received professorships and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences  Not being under any obligation to lecture  Jacob seldom did so but together with his brother worked on their great dictionary  During their time in Kassel  Jacob regularly attended the meetings of the academy  where he read papers on widely varied subjects  The best known are those on Lachmann  Schiller  his brother Wilhelm  old age  and on the origin of language  He also described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel  interspersing his more general observations with linguistic details  as is the case in all his works   Grimm died in Berlin at the age of 78  working until the very end of his life   He was never seriously ill  and habitually worked all day without pause but also without haste  He showed great patience for interruption  even seeming to be refreshed by it  and able to return to his work without effort  He wrote for the press with great rapidity  and rarely made corrections  He never revised what he had written  remarking with a certain wonder about his brother  Wilhelm  who read his own manuscripts over again before sending them to press  His temperament was uniformly cheerful and he was easily amused  Outside his own special work he had a marked taste for botany  The spirit that animated his work is best described by himself at the end of his autobiography    Nearly all my labors have been devoted  either directly or indirectly  to the investigation of our earlier language  poetry and laws  These studies may have appeared to many  and may still appear  useless  to me they have always seemed a noble and earnest task  definitely and inseparably connected with our common fatherland  and calculated to foster the love of it  My principle has always been in these investigations to under value nothing  but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great  the popular tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments    2  Linguistic work  The purely scientific side of Grimm s character developed slowly  He seems to have felt the want of definite principles of etymology without being able to discover them  and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar  1819  he often seemed to be groping in the dark  As early as 1815 we find August Wilhelm von Schlegel reviewing the Altdeutsche Wälder  a periodical published by the two brothers  very severely  condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained  and insisting on the necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of the laws of language  especially in the correspondence of sounds  This criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm s studies   Grimm s scientific character is notable for its combination of breadth and unity  He was as far removed from the narrowness of the specialist who has no ideas or sympathies beyond just one author or corner of science as he was from the shallow dabbler who feverishly attempts to master the details of a half dozen unrelated pursuits  The same concentration exists within his own specialised studies  The very foundations of his nature were harmonious  his patriotism and love of historical investigation realised their fullest satisfaction in the study of the language  traditions  mythology  laws and literature of his own country  But from this centre  he pursued his investigations in every direction as far as his instinct allowed  He was equally fortunate in the harmony that existed between his intellectual and moral natures  He cheerfully made the heavy sacrifices that science demands from its disciples without envy or bitterness  although he lived apart from his fellow men  he was full of human sympathy   and has had a profound influence on the destiny of mankind    2 1  History of the German Language  Of all his more general works the boldest and most far reaching was Grimm s Geschichte der deutschen Sprache  History of the German Language   in which linguistic elements are emphasized  The subject of the work is the history hidden in the words of the German language  the oldest natural history of the Teutonic tribes determined by means of language   To this end he laboriously collected scattered words and allusions found in classical lliterature  and endeavoured to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the Getae  Thracians  Scythians  and many other nations whose languages were at the time known only through doubtfully identified  often extremely corrupted remains preserved by Greek and Latin authors  Grimm s results have been greatly modified by the wider range of comparison and improved methods of investigation that now characterize linguistics  and many questions he raised will probably remain obscure  but his book s influence has been profound   2 2  German Grammar  Grimm s famous Deutsche Grammatik  German Grammar  was the outcome of his purely philological work  The labors of past generations from the humanists onwards resulted in an enormous collection of materials in the form of text editions  dictionaries  and grammars  although most of it was uncritical and unreliable  Some work had even been done in the way of comparison and determination of general laws  and the concept of a comparative Germanic grammar had been clearly grasped by the illustrious Englishman George Hickes by the beginning of the 18th century in his Thesaurus  Ten Kate in the Netherlands had  afterwards   after Grimm s book   made valuable contributions to the history and comparison of Germanic languages  Even Grimm himself did not initially intend to include all the languages in his Grammar  but he soon found that Old High German postulated Gothic  and that the later stages of German could not be understood without the help of other West Germanic varieties including English  and that the rich literature of Scandinavia could likewise not be ignored  The first edition of the first part of the Grammar  which appeared in 1819 treated the inflections of all these languages  It included a general introduction in which he vindicated the importance of an historical study of the German language against the a priori  quasi philosophical methods then in vogue   In 1822 this same volume appeared in a second edition  really a new work  for  as Grimm himself says in the preface  it cost him little reflection to  mow the first crop down to the ground    The considerable gap between the two stages of Grimm s development of these two editions is significantly shown by the fact that  while the first edition gives only the inflections  the second volume addresses phonology with no fewer than 600 pages   more than half of the volume  Grimm had  at last  awakened to the full conviction that all philology must be based on rigorous adhesion to the laws of sound change in order to be sound  and he subsequently never deviated from this principle  This gave to all his investigations  even in their boldest flights  an iron bound consistency  and a force of conviction that distinguishes science from dilettanteism  Prior to Grimm s time  philology was nothing than laborious and conscientious dilettanteism  with occasional instances of scientific inspiration   His advances must be attributed mainly to the influence of his contemporary Rasmus Christian Rask  Rask was born two years later than Grimm  but his remarkable precocity set him beyond his years  In Grimm s first editions  his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask s grammar  and in his second edition  he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English  His debt to Rask can be appreciated only by comparing his treatment of Old English in the two editions  the difference is very great  For example  in the first edition he declines dæg  dæges  plural dægas  without having observed the law of vowel change pointed out by Rask   The correct plural is dagas   There can be little doubt that the appearance of Rask s Old English grammar was the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning  To Rask also belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of sound correspondence in the different languages  especially in the vowels  those more fleeting elements of speech previously ignored by etymologists    The Grammar was continued in three volumes  treating principally derivation  composition and syntax  the last of which was unfinished  Grimm then began a third edition  of which only one part  comprising the vowels  appeared in 1840  his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary  The Grammar stands alone in the annals of science for its comprehensiveness  method and fullness of detail  Every law  every letter  every syllable of inflection in the different languages was illustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material  and it has served as a model for all succeeding investigators  Diez s grammar of the Romance languages is founded entirely on its methods  which have also exerted a profound influence on the wider study of the Indo European languages in general   2 3  Grimm s Law  Jacob is recognized for enunciating Grimm s law  the Germanic Sound Shift  that was first observed by the Danish philologist Rasmus Christian Rask  Grimm s law was the first non trivial systematic sound change to be discovered  Grimm s Law  also known as  Rask s Grimm s Rule  is the first law in linguistics concerning a non trivial sound change  It was a turning point in the development of linguistics  allowing the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historic linguistic research  It concerns the correspondence of consonants in the older Indo European  and Low Saxon and High German languages  and was first fully stated by Grimm in the second edition of the first part of his grammar  The correspondence of single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by several of his predecessors including Friedrich von Schlegel  Rasmus Christian Rask and Johan Ihre  the last having established a considerable number of literarum permutationes  such as b for f  with the examples bœra   ferre  befwer   fiber  Rask  in his essay on the origin of the Icelandic language  gave the same comparisons  with a few additions and corrections  and even the very same examples in most cases  As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentioned this essay of Rask  there is every probability that it inspired his own investigations  But there is a wide difference between the isolated permutations of his predecessors and his own comprehensive generalizations  The extension of the law to High German is entirely his own work  however   The only fact that can be adduced in support of the assertion that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority is that he does not expressly mention Rask s results in his second edition  But this is part of the plan of his work  to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others  In his first edition he expressly calls attention to Rask s essay  and praises it most ungrudgingly  It is true that a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask  but this may have well been the fault of the latter  who  impatient of contradiction and irritable in controversy  refused to consider the value of Grimm s views when they involved modification of his own   2 4  German Dictionary  Grimm s monumental dictionary of the German Language  the Deutsches Wörterbuch  was started in 1838 and first published in 1854  The Brothers anticipated it would take 10 years and encompass some 6 7 volumes  However  it was undertaken on so large a scale as to make it impossible for them to complete it  The dictionary  as far as it was worked on by Grimm himself  has been described as a collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of high value  It was finally finished by subsequent scholars in 1961 and supplemented in 1971  At 33 volumes at some 330 000 headwords  it remains a standard work of reference to the present day  A current project at the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities is underway to update the Deutsches Wörterbuch to modern academic standards  Volumes A F are scheduled for release in 2012   3  Literary work  The first work Jacob Grimm published  Über den altdeutschen Meistergesang  1811   was of a purely literary character  Yet even in this essay Grimm showed that Minnesang and Meistergesang were really one form of poetry  of which they merely represented different stages of development  and also announced his important discovery of the invariable division of the Lied into three strophic parts   Grimm s text editions were mostly prepared in conjunction with his brother  In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the Hildebrandslied and the Weißenbrunner Gebet  Jacob having discovered what till then had never been suspected — namely the alliteration in these poems  However  Jacob had little taste for text editing  and  as he himself confessed  working on a critical text gave him little pleasure  He therefore left this department to others  especially Lachmann  who soon turned his brilliant critical genius  trained in the severe school of classical philology  to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre   Both Brothers were attracted from the beginning by all national poetry  whether in the form of epics  ballads or popular tales  They published In 1816–1818 a collection of legends culled from diverse sources and published the two volume Deutsche Sagen  German Legends   At the same time they collected all the folktales they could find  partly from the mouths of the people  partly from manuscripts and books  and published in 1812–1815 the first edition of those Kinder  und Hausmärchen  Children s and Household Tales   which has carried the name of the brothers Grimm into every household of the western world  The closely related subject of the satirical beast epic of the Middle Ages also held great charm for Jacob Grimm  and he published an edition of the Reinhart Fuchs in 1834  His first contribution to mythology was the first volume of an edition of the Eddaic songs  undertaken jointly with his brother  and was published in 1815  However  this work was not followed by any others on the subject   The first edition of his Deutsche Mythologie  German Mythology  appeared in 1835  This great work covered the whole range of the subject  tracing the mythology and superstitions of the old Teutons back to the very dawn of direct evidence  and following their evolution to modern day popular traditions  tales  and expressions   4  Legal scholarship  Grimm s work as a jurist was influential for the development of the history of law  particularly in Northern Europe   His essay Von der Poesie im Recht  Poetry in Law  1816  developed a far reaching  suprapositivist Romantic conception of law  The Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer  German Legal Antiquities  1828  was a comprehensive compilation of sources of law from all Germanic languages  whose structure allowed an initial understanding of older German legal traditions not influenced by Roman law  Grimm s Weisthümer  4 vol   1840–63   a compilation of partially oral legal traditions from rural Germany  allows research of the development of written law in Northern Europe   5  Politics  Jacob Grimm s work tied in strongly to his views on Germany and its culture  His work with fairy tales and his philological work dealt with German origins  He loved his people and wished for a united Germany  he and his brother were vocal proponents of expansionist Pan Germanism  In the German revolution of 1848  he was given a chance to make these views known when he was elected to the Frankfurt National Parliament  The people of Germany had demanded a constitution  so the Parliament  formed of elected members from various German states  met to form one  Grimm was selected for the office in a large part because of his part in the University of Goettingen s refusal to swear to the king of Hanover expounded upon above  He then went to Frankfurt  where he did not play a big part  but did make some speeches  which tended to stray into the realms of history and philology rather than whatever political question was at hand  Grimm was adamant on one subject  however  he wanted the Danish ruled but German speaking duchy of Holstein to be under German control  He talked passionately on this subject  which showed his fierce German nationalism   Grimm was not made to be a politician  and also soon realized that the National Assembly was not getting anywhere  it was eventually dissolved without establishing a constitution   and so asked to be released from his duties and returned with relief to his former studies  His political career did not bloom into anything great  but it does illustrate his characteristics—his nationalism and his moralism  He believed that good would triumph in the Parliament  and pushed for human rights legislation just as he wished for a unified Germany   6  Works  The following is a complete list of his separately published works  Those he published with his brother are marked with
