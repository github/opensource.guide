The  Originally known as VR 32  is a 32 bit table top 3D video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo  It was marketed as the first  portable  video game console capable of displaying  true 3D graphics  out of the box   It was released on July 21  1995 in Japan and August 14  1995 in North America at a price of around US$180  It proved to be a commercial failure and was not released in other regions  Its lukewarm reception was unaffected by continued price drops  Nintendo discontinued it the following year on March 2  1996   1  History  1 1  Development  In the early 1990s  Nintendo and Sega had seen success with their 16 bit consoles but the games market had stalled  There was still a period of delay before the 32 bit consoles would launch  and competitors such as the PlayStation were readying for launch  In this context  Nintendo and Sega hoped  to reignite the market for their games    The New York Times previewed the Virtual Boy on November 13  1994  The console was officially announced via press release the next day  November 14  Nintendo promised that Virtual Boy would  totally immerse players into their own private universe   The system was formally unveiled the next day at the Shoshinkai  初心会  Show  Nintendo of America showed the Virtual Boy at the Consumer Electronics Show on 6 January 1995   While Nintendo s Research & Development 3 division  R&D3  was focused on developing the Nintendo 64  the other two engineering units were free to experiment with new product ideas  The Virtual Boy was designed by Gunpei Yokoi  the general manager of Nintendo s R&D1  and the inventor of the Game & Watch and Game Boy handheld consoles  He saw the Virtual Boy as a unique technology that competitors would find difficult to emulate  Additionally  the console was intended to enhance Nintendo s reputation as an innovator   Initial press releases and interviews about the system focused on its technological capabilities  avoiding discussion of the actual games that would be released  The company entered into an exclusive agreement with Reflection Technology to license the technology for the Scanned Linear Array displays   Problems emerged when Nintendo attempted to turn its vision into an affordable console  searching for low cost hardware components  Yokoi opted for red LEDs because they were the cheapest  Nintendo said a color display would have been prohibitively expensive  Color was also said to have caused  jumpy images in tests   Even with cost saving measures in place  Nintendo priced the Virtual Boy at a relatively high US$180  While slightly less expensive than a home console  and significantly less powerful   this was considerably more costly than the Game Boy handheld   With seemingly more advanced graphics  the Virtual Boy was not intended to replace the Game Boy in Nintendo s product line  as use of the system requires a steady surface and completely blocks the player s peripheral vision  According to David Sheff s book Game Over  Yokoi never actually intended for the console to be released in its ultimate form  However  Nintendo pushed the Virtual Boy to market so that it could focus development resources on the Nintendo 64  Design News described the Virtual Boy as the logical evolution of the View Master 3 dimensional image viewer   A number of technology demonstrations were used to show what the Virtual Boy was capable of  Driving Demo was one of the more advanced demos  its 30 second clip showed a first person view of driving by road signs and palm trees  This demo was shown at E3 and CES in 1995  The start up screen of the Virtual Boy Prototype was shown at Shoshinkai in 1994  The demo of what would have been a Star Fox game showed a Star Fox like Arwing doing various spins and motions  Cinematic camera angles were a key element  as they were in Star Fox 2  It was shown at E3 and CES in 1995   1 2  Promotion  Nintendo extensively advertised the Virtual Boy  and claimed to have spent US$25 million on early promotional activities  Advertising promoted the system as a paradigm shift from past consoles  some pieces used cavemen to indicate a historical evolution  while others utilized psychedelic imagery  Nintendo targeted an older audience with advertisements for the Virtual Boy  shifting away from the traditional focus on children it had employed in the past   Nintendo portrayed the system as a type of virtual reality  as its name indicates  it was to be more than just another gaming console  Nintendo also focused on the technological aspects of the new console in its press releases  neglecting to detail specific games   Confronted with the challenge of showing 3 dimensional gameplay on 2 dimensional advertisements  the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort  A $5 million campaign promoted NBC s fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy  American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster  This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system  and produced 750 000 rentals  Upon returning the unit  renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store  3 000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion  which included a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows  Despite its popularity  the rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy s long term success  allowing gamers to see just how un immersive the console was  Taken as a whole  the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure   1 3  Release  The Virtual Boy was released on in Japan and on in North America with the launch titles Mario s Tennis  Red Alarm  Teleroboxer  and Galactic Pinball  It was not released in PAL markets  In North America  Nintendo shipped Mario s Tennis with every Virtual Boy sold  as a pack in game  Nintendo had initially projected sales of 3 million consoles and 14 million games  The system arrived later than other 32 bit systems from Sony  Panasonic  and Sega  but at a lower price   At the system s release  Nintendo of America projected hardware sales of 1 5 million units and software sales numbering 2 5 million by the end of the year  Nintendo had shipped 350 000 units of the Virtual Boy by December 1995  around three and a half months after its North American release  The system made number 5 on GamePros the  Top 10 Worst Selling Consoles of All Time  list in 2007   The Virtual Boy did not live very long following its disappointing sales  The last official title to be released for the Virtual Boy was 3D Tetris  released on   Nintendo announced additional titles for the system at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1996  but these games never saw the light of day  The Virtual Boy was discontinued in late 1995 in Japan and in early 1996 in North America  Nintendo killed the system without fanfare  avoiding an official press release   2  Hardware  The Virtual Boy was Nintendo s first 32 bit system  The Virtual Boy system uses a pair of 1×224 linear arrays  one per eye  and rapidly scans the array across the eye s field of view using flat oscillating mirrors  These mirrors vibrate back and forth at a very high speed  thus the mechanical humming noise from inside the unit  Each Virtual Boy game cartridge has a yes no option to automatically pause every 15–30 minutes so that the player may take a break before any injuries to the eyes  One speaker per ear provides the player with audio   2 1  Display  The Virtual Boy was the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying  true 3D graphics  out of the box  in a form of virtual reality  Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two dimensional screen  the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax  In a manner similar to using a head mounted display  the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine  and then an eyeglass style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic  in this case  red  image  Nintendo claimed that a color display would have made the system too expensive and resulted in  jumpy  images  so the company opted for a monochrome display   2 2  Control  The Virtual Boy was meant to be used sitting down at a table  although Nintendo said it would release a harness for players to use while standing  One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back  It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system  This can be substituted with a wall adapter  though a  slide on  attachment is required for the switchout  Once the slide on adapter is installed  a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power   The Virtual Boy  being a system with heavy emphasis on three dimensional movement  needed a controller that could operate along a Z axis  The Virtual Boy s controller was an attempt to implement dual digital  D pads  to control elements in the aforementioned 3D environment  The controller itself is shaped like an  M   similar to a Nintendo 64 controller   One holds onto either side of the controller and the part that dips down in the middle contains the battery pack   In more traditional 2 dimensional games  the two directional pads are interchangeable  For others with a more 3D environment  like Red Alarm  3D Tetris  or Teleroboxer  each pad controls a different feature  The symmetry of the controller also allows left handed gamers to reverse the controls  similar to the Atari Lynx    2 3  Connectivity  During development  Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play  The system s EXT  extension  port  located on the underside of the system below the controller port  was never officially supported since no  official  multiplayer games were ever published  nor was an official link cable released   Although Waterworld and Faceball were going to use the EXT port for multiplayer play  the multiplayer features in the former were removed and the latter was canceled    3  Games  Nintendo initially showcased three games for the Virtual Boy  They planned to release three titles at launch  and two or three per month thereafter  Given the system s short lifespan  only 22 games were released  Of them  19 games were released in the Japanese market  while 14 were released in North America     the homebrew community at Planet Virtual Boy were still developing unofficial software  Two previously unreleased games  namely Bound High and the Japanese version of Faceball  known as NikoChan Battle  have finally seen the light of day   When asked if Virtual Boy games were going to be available for download on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo 3DS  Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils Aime said he could not answer  as he was unfamiliar with the platform  He noted that  given his lack of familiarity  he would be hard pressed to make the case for inclusion of the games on the Virtual Console   4  Reception  The Virtual Boy was a commercial failure  The Virtual Boy failed for a number of reasons  among them  its high price  the discomfort caused by play       and what was widely judged to have been a poorly handled marketing campaign    Gamers who previewed the system at the Shoshinkai 1995 show complained that the Mario demo was not realistic enough  was not in full color  and didn t allow for  tracking   the movement of the image when the player turns his or her head   Following its release  reviews of the Virtual Boy tended to praise its novelty  but questioned its ultimate purpose and longtime viability  The Los Angeles Times described gameplay as being  at once familiar and strange   The column praised the quality of motion and immersive graphics  but considered the hardware itself tedious to use and non portable  A later column by the same reviewer found the system to be somewhat asocial  although it held out hope for the console s future   While Nintendo had promised a virtual reality experience  the monochrome display limited the Virtual Boy s potential for immersion  Reviewers often considered the 3 dimensional features a gimmick  added to games that were essentially 2  or even 1 dimensional  The Washington Post felt that  even when a game gives the impression of 3 dimensionality  it suffers from  hollow vector graphics   Yokoi  the system s inventor  noted the system s relative strengths with action and puzzle games  although those types of games provided only minimal immersion  Multiple critics lamented the absence of head tracking in the Virtual Boy hardware  Critics found that  as a result  players were unable to immerse themselves in the game worlds of Virtual Boy games  Instead  they interacted with the fictional worlds in the manner of any traditional 2 dimensional game  that is  via a controller   Boyer said the console  struggles to merge the two distinct media forms of home consoles and virtual reality devices   While the device employed virtual reality techniques  it did so via the traditional home console  No feedback from the body was incorporated into gameplay   Many reviewers complained of painful and frustrating physiological symptoms when playing the Virtual Boy  Bill Frischling  writing for The Washington Post  experienced  dizziness  nausea and headaches   Reviewers attributed the problems to both the monochromatic display and uncomfortable ergonomics  Nintendo  in the years after Virtual Boy s demise  has been frank about its failure  Howard Lincoln  chairman of Nintendo of America  said flatly that the Virtual Boy  just failed    5  Legacy  According to Game Over  Nintendo laid blame for the machine s faults directly on its creator  Gunpei Yokoi  The commercial demise of the Virtual Boy was said to be the catalyst that led to Yokoi being driven from Nintendo  Nevertheless  The New York Times maintained that Yokoi kept a close relationship with Nintendo despite Yokoi having later created the WonderSwan  a rival handheld system for Bandai   Although considered a failure in the traditional sense  the Virtual Boy did little to alter Nintendo s development approach and focus on innovation  If anything  it encouraged a more open ended metric for success than finances or sales  While the console itself failed in many regards  its focus on peripherals and haptic technology reemerged in later years  The hope of developing a virtual reality gaming platform has considerably outlived the Virtual Boy itself  Because Nintendo only shipped 1 26m Virtual Boy units worldwide  it is considered a valuable collector s item   With the launch of the Nintendo 3DS console in 2011  Nintendo released a true handheld gaming console with auto stereoscopic 3D visuals  In other words  this console produced the desired effects without any special glasses and was portable  In the period leading up to the release of the Nintendo 3DS  Shigeru Miyamoto discussed what he felt were the issues with the Virtual Boy  One was the actual use of the three dimensional effects   while it was designed to render wireframe graphics  it was generally used to separate two dimensional games into different planes separated by depth  Further  Miyamoto stated that the graphics were not as appealing  and while developing the Nintendo 64  had ruled out the use of wireframe graphics as too sparse to draw players  Finally  he stated that he perceived the Virtual Boy as a novelty that should not have used the Nintendo license so prominently   6  In popular culture  In the eponymous anime series  Maria Holic  a dorm adviser is going over a list of items not approved in dorm rooms  with one item of the list reading  Game Consoles  except Virtual Boy    When asked why the Virtual Boy was an exception  she replies  Because God  referring to herself  loves things that have a tragic history   referencing the Virtual Boy s short lived shelf life  It is referenced frequently throughout the show and at one point is lined up with other failed devices that include Sony s PocketStation and Betamax  SEGA s Dreamcast  Enterbrain s Jashin MOK KOS figurine and Nintendo s Power Glove   In the game Tomodachi Life  Tomodachi  New Life in Japan   the game made several self references to the Virtual Boy  The first reference the western market received of the Virtual Boy  was in the Localisation Trailer for the game  as it has previously been a Japan exclusive game  In said trailer  there is a clip of Nintendo Staff  personified as in game  Mii s   ritualising a Virtual Boy  exclaiming   All Hail The Virtual Boy    This is a reference to the utter failure of the system  and the fact that Nintendo mocked themselves of this mistake  Another reference comes from The shopkeeper in the game  upon buying  or trading in  a Virtual Boy  he  she would say  dig the red and black styling   both a reference to the colour scheme and the colours the screen would display  The final reference is a Virtual Boy can be an opponent  Boss in the minigame  Tomodachi Quest   7  See also  Entex Adventure Vision  a 1982 video game console with similar mechanical operation   Sega VR  a 1993 prototype virtual reality add on for the Sega
