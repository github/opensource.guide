Serotonin syndrome is a potential symptom of any number of life threatening drug interactions which may follow therapeutic drug use  combination  overdose of particular drugs  or the recreational use of certain drugs  Serotonin syndrome is not an idiopathic drug reaction  it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the CNS and or peripheral nervous system  For this reason  some experts strongly prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome which more accurately reflect that it is a form of poisoning  Other names include serotonin sickness  serotonin storm  serotonin poisoning  hyperserotonemia  or serotonergic syndrome   Excessive levels of serotonin produce a spectrum of specific symptoms including cognitive  autonomic  and somatic effects  Symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal  Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome  though the exact mechanism is not well understood in many instances   Diagnosis includes observing symptoms and investigating patient history for causal factors  interacting drugs   The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illnesses in some people  particularly those with neuroleptic malignant syndrome  No laboratory tests can currently confirm the diagnosis  Hence it is diagnosed based on symptoms  disease course  that is  the progression of the disease  and the exclusion of other possible causes of the presenting symptoms   Treatment consists of discontinuing medications which may contribute and in moderate to severe cases administering a serotonin antagonist  An important adjunct treatment includes controlling agitation with benzodiazepine sedation  The high profile case of Libby Zion  who is generally accepted to have died from serotonin syndrome  resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State   1  Signs and symptoms  Symptom onset is usually rapid  often occurring within minutes of elevated serotonin levels  Serotonin syndrome encompasses a wide range of clinical findings  Mild symptoms may consist of increased heart rate  shivering  sweating  dilated pupils  myoclonus  intermittent tremor or twitching   as well as overresponsive reflexes  However  many of these symptoms may be side effects of the drug or drug interaction causing excessive levels of serotonin  not an effect of elevated serotonin itself  Tremor is a common side effect of MDMA s action at dopamine  whereas hyperreflexia is symptomatic of exposure to 5 HT agonists  Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds  high blood pressure and hyperthermia  a temperature as high as is common in moderate intoxication  The overactive reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs  Mental changes include hypervigilance or insomnia and agitation  Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock  Temperature may rise to above in life threatening cases  Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis  rhabdomyolysis  seizures  renal failure  and disseminated intravascular coagulation  these effects usually arising as a consequence of hyperthermia   The symptoms are often described as a clinical triad of abnormalities   Cognitive effects  headache  agitation  hypomania  mental confusion  hallucinations  coma  Autonomic effects  shivering  sweating  hyperthermia  vasoconstriction  tachycardia  nausea  diarrhea   Somatic effects  myoclonus  muscle twitching   hyperreflexia  manifested by clonus   tremor   2  Cause  A large number of medications either alone in high dose or in combination can produce serotonin syndrome   Many cases of serotonin toxicity occur in patients who have ingested drug combinations that synergistically increase synaptic serotonin  It may also occur as a symptom of overdose of a single serotonergic agent  The combination of MAOIs with precursors such as l tryptophan or 5 htp pose a particularly acute risk of life threatening serotonin syndrome  The case of combination of MAOIs with tryptamine agonists  commonly known as ayahuasca  can present similar dangers as their combination with precursors  but this phenomenon has been described in general terms as the  cheese effect   Many MAOIs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase  It can take at least four weeks for this enzyme to be replaced by the body in the instance of irreversible inhibitors   Many medications may have been incorrectly thought to cause serotonin syndrome  For example  some case reports have implicated atypical antipsychotics in serotonin syndrome  but it appears based on their pharmacology that they are unlikely to cause the syndrome  It has also been suggested that mirtazapine has no significant serotonergic effects  and is therefore not a dual action drug  Bupropion has also been suggested to cause serotonin syndrome  although as there is no evidence that it has any significant serotonergic activity  it is thought unlikely to produce the syndrome  In 2006 the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert suggesting that the combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptan medications or sibutramine could potentially lead to severe cases of serotonin syndrome  This has been disputed by other researchers as none of the cases reported by the FDA met the Hunter criteria for serotonin syndrome  The condition has however occurred in surprising clinical situations  and because of phenotypic variations among individuals  it has been associated with unexpected drugs  including mirtazapine   The relative risk and severity of serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity  with individual drugs and combinations  is complex  Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients of all ages  including the elderly  children  and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure  The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose  but even in over dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults  Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together  Various drugs  other than SSRIs  also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors   e g  tramadol  amphetamine  and MDMA  and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome   3  Pathophysiology  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in multiple states including aggression  pain  sleep  appetite  anxiety  depression  migraine  and vomiting  In humans the effects of excess serotonin were first noted in 1960 in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor  MAOI  and tryptophan  The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the central nervous system  It was originally suspected that agonism of 5 HT1A receptors in central grey nuclei and the medulla was responsible for the development of the syndrome  Further study has determined that overstimulation of primarily the 5 HT2A receptors appears to contribute substantially to the condition  The 5 HT1A receptor may still contribute through a pharmacodynamic interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes  Additionally  noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS norepinephrine concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome  Other neurotransmitters may also play a role  NMDA receptor antagonists and GABA have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome  Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra therapeutic doses and overdoses  and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose   3 1  Spectrum concept  A postulated  spectrum concept  of serotonin toxicity emphasises the role that progressively increasing serotonin levels play in mediating the clinical picture as side effects merge into toxicity  The dose effect relationship is the effects of progressive elevation of serotonin  either by raising the dose of one drug  or combining it with another serotonergic drug which may produce large elevations in serotonin levels   3 2  Agonists and metabolic affect  Singular use of LSD or other 5ht agonists is unlikely to cause serotonin syndrome in lieu of other metabotropic properties which affect the serotonin system  However  agonists at 5ht would increase the severity of certain symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome  depending on the 5ht subtypes for which the agonist is selective  The effect of agonists do not explicitly qualify as a syndrome of serotonin  the ligand  but may be considered a syndrome which affects the serotonin system  i e   5ht receptor syndrome   Agonists cause sensitization to the presence of the ligand or directly stimulate receptors  hence the temperature increase is produced by increased physical activity  In the classical case of serotonin accumulation syndrome  temperature increase is mediated by enzymatic activity of MAO A  The nature of serotonin syndrome may be understood in general terms of affect on serotonin metabolism  e g  to catabolic or anabolic  SSRIs and releasing agents bias the serotonin system towards catabolism by blocking reuptake  while monoamine oxidase inhibitors inhibit catabolism of serotonin  shifting to anabolic   The acute combinatory danger of any substance which acts as a catabolic shunt with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is not their obvious potential for causing dangerous serotonin accumulation  In many cases a number of different enzymes are inhibited or acted upon which interfere with the metabolism of the combination of drugs taken and prolong serotonergic effects  This extended enzyme interference describes deaths attributable to the combination of MDMA and moclobemide  4  Diagnosis  There is no laboratory test for serotonin syndrome  Therefore diagnosis is by symptom observation and investigation of the patient s history  Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed  The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach  a professor of psychiatry at UCLA  Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules  which have better sensitivity and specificity  84% and 97%  respectively  when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist  As of 2007  Sternbach s criteria were still the most commonly used   The most important symptoms for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are tremor  extreme aggressiveness  akathisia  or clonus  spontaneous  inducible and ocular   Physical examination of the patient should include assessment of deep tendon reflexes and muscle rigidity  the dryness of the oral mucosa  the size and reactivity of the pupils  the intensity of bowel sounds  skin color  and the presence or absence of sweating  The patient s history also plays an important role in diagnosis  investigations should include inquries about the use of prescription and over the counter drugs  illicit substances  and dietary supplements  as all these agents have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome  To fulfill the Hunter Criteria  a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and meet one of the following conditions   Spontaneous clonus  or  Inducible clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis  or  Ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis  or  Tremor plus hyperreflexia  or  Hypertonism plus temperature   plus ocular clonus or inducible clonus  4 1  Differential diagnosis  Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to confuse with other medical conditions  but in some situations it may go unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a viral illness  anxiety  neurological disorder  anticholinergic poisoning  sympathomimetic toxicity  or worsening psychiatric condition  The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome  NMS   The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult  In both conditions  autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop  However  they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction  serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade   Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity  Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine  Dopamine receptor blockade  NMS  has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine   Differential diagnosis may become difficult in patients recently exposed to both serotonergic drugs and neuroleptic drugs  Features that are classically present in NMS  that are useful for differentiating the two  are bradykinesia and extrapyramidal  lead pipe  rigidity  whereas serotonin syndrome causes hyperkinesia and clonus   5  Management  Management is based primarily on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs  the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine  and supportive care including the control of agitation  the control of autonomic instability  and the control of hyperthermia  Additionally  those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal if it can be administered within an hour of overdose  The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms  If the symptoms are mild  treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications  offering supportive measures  giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus  and waiting for the symptoms to resolve  Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists  The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy  although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome  Despite the absence of controlled trials  there are a number of case reports detailing apparent improvement after patients have been administered cyproheptadine  Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists  Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube  it is unlikely to be effective in patients administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases  Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine  Critically ill patients should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis  Patient who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine  norepinephrine  or phenylephrine  Conversely  hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol  longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock  The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment  Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen  so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis  oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin  The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication  In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin  In such instances hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated   5 1  Agitation  Specific treatment for some symptoms may be required  One of the most important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of injury to patient or caregivers  benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this  Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia  If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation  The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown  This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis   5 2  Hyperthermia  Treatment for hyperthermia includes reducing muscle over activity via sedation with a benzodiazepine  More severe cases may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium  intubation  and artificial ventilation  Succinylcholine is not recommended for muscular paralysis as it may increase the risk of cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis  Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality   6  Prognosis  Upon the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs  most cases of serotonin syndrome resolve within 24 hours  although in some cases delirium may persist for a number of days  Symptoms typically persist for a longer time frame in patients taking drugs which have a long elimination half life  active metabolites  or a protracted duration of action   Cases have reported muscle pain and weakness persisting for months  and antidepressant discontinuation may contribute to ongoing features  Following appropriate medical management  serotonin syndrome is generally associated with a favorable prognosis   7  Epidemiology  Epidemiological studies of serotonin syndrome are difficult as many physicians are unaware of the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations  In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome  The incidence may be increasing as a larger number of pro serotonergic drugs  drugs which increase serotonin levels  are now being used in clinical practice  One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0 4 cases per 1000 patient months for patients who were taking nefazodone  Additionally  around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome   8  Notable cases  The most widely recognized example of serotonin syndrome was the death of Libby Zion in 1984  Zion was a freshman at Bennington College at her death on March 5  1984  at age 18  She died within 8 hours of her emergency admission to the New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center  She had an ongoing history of depression  and came to the Manhattan hospital on the evening of March 4  1984  with a fever  agitation and  strange jerking motions  of her body  She also seemed disoriented at times  The emergency room physicians were unable to diagnose her condition definitively  but admitted her for hydration and observation  Her death was caused by a combination of pethidine and phenelzine  A medical intern prescribed the pethidine  The case had an impact on graduate medical education and residency work hours  Limits were set on working hours for medical post graduates  commonly referred to as interns or residents  in hospital training programs  and they also now require closer senior physician supervision   9  Notes  10  References  11  External links  from  Carcinoid syndrome
