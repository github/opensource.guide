In mathematics  a filter is a special subset of a partially ordered set  For example  the power set of some set  partially ordered by set inclusion  is a filter  Filters appear in order and lattice theory  but can also be found in topology whence they originate  The dual notion of a filter is an ideal   Filters were introduced by Henri Cartan in 1937 and subsequently used by Bourbaki in their book Topologie Générale as an alternative to the similar notion of a net developed in 1922 by E  H  Moore and H  L  Smith   1  Motivation  Intuitively  a filter on a partially ordered set  poset  contains those elements that are large enough to satisfy some criterion  For example  if x is an element of the poset  then the set of elements that are above x is a filter  called the principal filter at x   Notice that if x and y are incomparable elements of the poset  then neither of the principal filters at x and y is contained in the other one    Similarly  a filter on a set contains those subsets that are sufficiently large to contain something  For example  if the set is the real line and x is one of its points  then the family of sets that contain x in their interior is a filter  called the filter of neighbourhoods of x   Notice that the thing in this case is slightly larger than x  but it still doesn t contain any other specific point of the line    The mathematical notion of filter provides a precise language to treat these situations in a rigorous and general way  which is useful in analysis  general topology and logic   2  General definition  A subset F of a partially ordered set  P ≤  is a filter if the following conditions hold   For every x  y in F  there is some element z in F such that z ≤ x and z ≤ y   F is a filter base  or downward directed   For every x in F and y in P  x ≤ y implies that y is in F   F is an upper set  or upward closed  A filter is proper if it is not equal to the whole set P  This condition is sometimes added to the definition of a filter   While the above definition is the most general way to define a filter for arbitrary posets  it was originally defined for lattices only  In this case  the above definition can be characterized by the following equivalent statement  A subset F of a lattice  P ≤  is a filter  if and only if it is an upper set that is closed under finite intersection  infima or meet   i e   for all x  y in F  we find that x ∧ y is also in F   The smallest filter that contains a given element p is a principal filter and p is a principal element in this situation  The principal filter for p is just given by the set  x in P   p ≤ x  and is denoted by prefixing p with an upward arrow     The dual notion of a filter  i e  the concept obtained by reversing all ≤ and exchanging ∧ with ∨  is ideal  Because of this duality  the discussion of filters usually boils down to the discussion of ideals  Hence  most additional information on this topic  including the definition of maximal filters and prime filters  is to be found in the article on ideals  There is a separate article on ultrafilters   3  Filter on a set  A special case of a filter is a filter defined on a set  Given a set S  a partial ordering ⊆ can be defined on the powerset P S  by subset inclusion  turning  P S  ⊆  into a lattice  Define a filter F on S as a nonempty subset of P S  with the following properties   S is in F  and if A and B are in F  then so is their intersection   F is closed under finite intersection   The empty set is not in F   F is a proper filter   If A is in F and A is a subset of B  then B is in F  for all subsets B of S   F is upward closed  The first two properties imply that a filter on a set has the finite intersection property  Note that with this definition  a filter on a set is indeed a filter  in fact  it is a proper filter  Because of this  sometimes this is called a proper filter on a set  however  the adjective  proper  is generally omitted and considered implicit  The only nonproper filter on S is P S    A filter base  or filter basis  is a subset B of P S  with the following properties   B is non empty and the intersection of any two sets of B contains a set of B   B is downward directed   The empty set is not in B   B is a proper filter base  Given a filter base B  the filter generated or spanned by B is defined as the minimum filter containing B  It is the family of all the subsets of S which contain some set of B  Every filter is also a filter base  so the process of passing from filter base to filter may be viewed as a sort of completion   If B and C are two filter bases on S  one says C is finer than B  or that C is a refinement of B  if for each B0 ∈ B  there is a C0 ∈ C such that C0 ⊆ B0  If also B is finer than C  one says that they are equivalent filter bases   If B and C are filter bases  then C is finer than B if and only if the filter spanned by C contains the filter spanned by B  Therefore  B and C are equivalent filter bases if and only if they generate the same filter   For filter bases A  B  and C  if A is finer than B and B is finer than C then A is finer than C  Thus the refinement relation is a preorder on the set of filter bases  and the passage from filter base to filter is an instance of passing from a preordering to the associated partial ordering  For any subset T of P S  there is a smallest  possibly nonproper  filter F containing T  called the filter generated or spanned by T  It is constructed by taking all finite intersections of T  which then form a filter base for F  This filter is proper if and only if any finite intersection of elements of T is non empty  and in that case we say that T is a filter subbase   3 1  Examples  Let S be a nonempty set and C be a nonempty subset  Then is a filter base  The filter it generates  i e   the collection of all subsets containing C  is called the principal filter generated by C   A filter is said to be a free filter if the intersection of all of its members is empty  A principal filter is not free  Since the intersection of any finite number of members of a filter is also a member  no filter on a finite set is free  and indeed is the principal filter generated by the common intersection of all of its members  A nonprincipal filter on an infinite set is not necessarily free   The Fréchet filter on an infinite set S is the set of all subsets of S that have finite complement  A filter on S is free if and only if it contains the Fréchet filter   Every uniform structure on a set X is a filter on XȕX   A filter in a poset can be created using the Rasiowa Sikorski lemma  often used in forcing   The set is called a filter base of tails of the sequence of natural numbers   A filter base of tails can be made of any net using the construction   Therefore  all nets generate a filter base  and therefore a filter   Since all sequences are nets  this holds for sequences as well   3 2  Filters in model theory  For any filter F on a set S  the set function defined by  is finitely additive — a  measure  if that term is construed rather loosely  Therefore the statement  can be considered somewhat analogous to the statement that φ holds  almost everywhere   That interpretation of membership in a filter is used  for motivation  although it is not needed for actual proofs  in the theory of ultraproducts in model theory  a branch of mathematical logic   3 3  Filters in topology  In topology and analysis  filters are used to define convergence in a manner similar to the role of sequences in a metric space   In topology and related areas of mathematics  a filter is a generalization of a net  Both nets and filters provide very general contexts to unify the various notions of limit to arbitrary topological spaces   A sequence is usually indexed by the natural numbers  which are a totally ordered set  Thus  limits in first countable spaces can be described by sequences  However  if the space is not first countable  nets or filters must be used  Nets generalize the notion of a sequence by requiring the index set simply be a directed set  Filters can be thought of as sets built from multiple nets  Therefore  both the limit of a filter and the limit of a net are conceptually the same as the limit of a sequence   3 3 1  Neighbourhood bases  Let X be a topological space and x a point of X   Take Nx to be the neighbourhood filter at point x for X  This means that Nx is the set of all topological neighbourhoods of the point x  It can be verified that Nx is a filter  A neighbourhood system is another name for a neighbourhood filter   To say that N is a neighbourhood base at x for X means that each subset V0 of X is a neighbourhood of x if and only if there exists N0 ∈ N such that N0 ⊆ V0  Note that every neighbourhood base at x is a filter base that generates the neighbourhood filter at x   3 3 2  Convergent filter bases  Let X be a topological space and x a point of X   To say that a filter base B converges to x  denoted B → x  means that for every neighbourhood U of x  there is a B0 ∈ B such that B0 ⊆ U  In this case  x is called a limit of B and B is called a convergent filter base   Every neighbourhood base N of x converges to x   If N is a neighbourhood base at x and C is a filter base on X  then C → x if and only if C is finer than N   If Y ⊆ X  a point p ∈ X is called a limit point of Y in X if and only if each neighborhood U of p in X intersects Y  This happens if and only if there is a filter base of subsets of Y that converges to p in X   For Y ⊆ X  the following are equivalent    i  There exists a filter base F whose elements are all contained in Y such that F → x    ii  There exists a filter F such that Y is an element of F and F → x    iii  The point x lies in the closure of Y  Indeed    i  implies  ii   if F is a filter base satisfying the properties of  i   then the filter associated to F satisfies the properties of  ii     ii  implies  iii   if U is any open neighborhood of x then by the definition of convergence U contains an element of F  since also Y is an element of F  U and Y have nonempty intersection    iii  implies  i   Define   Then F is a filter base satisfying the properties of  i    3 3 3  Clustering  Let X be a topological space and x a point of X   A filter base B on X is said to cluster at x  or have x as a cluster point  if and only if each element of B has nonempty intersection with each neighbourhood of x   If a filter base B clusters at x and is finer than a filter base C  then C clusters at x too   Every limit of a filter base is also a cluster point of the base   A filter base B that has x as a cluster point may not converge to x  But there is a finer filter base that does  For example the filter base of finite intersections of sets of the subbase    For a filter base B  the set ∩ cl B0    B0∈B  is the set of all cluster points of B  note  cl B0  is the closure of B0   Assume that X is a complete lattice   The limit inferior of B is the infimum of the set of all cluster points of B   The limit superior of B is the supremum of the set of all cluster points of B   B is a convergent filter base if and only if its limit inferior and limit superior agree  in this case  the value on which they agree is the limit of the filter base   3 3 4  Properties of a topological space  Let X be a topological space   X is a Hausdorff space if and only if every filter base on X has at most one limit   X is compact if and only if every filter base on X clusters   X is compact if and only if every filter base on X is a subset of a convergent filter base   X is compact if and only if every ultrafilter on X converges   3 3 5  Functions on topological spaces  Let   be topological spaces  Let be a filter base on and be a function  The image of under is is the set   The image forms a filter base on    Do not confuse the x element of B and x point in X    is continuous at if and only if implies    3 3 6  Cauchy filters  Let be a metric space   To say that a filter base B on X is Cauchy means that for each real number ε 0  there is a B0 ∈ B such that the metric diameter of B0 is less than ε   Take  xn  to be a sequence in metric space X   xn  is a Cauchy sequence if and only if the filter base xN xN+1        N ∈  1 2 3        is Cauchy  More generally  given a uniform space X  a filter F on X is called Cauchy filter if for every entourage U there is an A ∈ F with  x y  ∈ U for all x y ∈ A  In a metric space this agrees with the previous definition  X is said to be complete if every Cauchy filter converges  Conversely  on a uniform space every convergent filter is a Cauchy filter  Moreover  every cluster point of a Cauchy filter is a limit point   A compact uniform space is complete  on a compact space each filter has a cluster point  and if the filter is Cauchy  such a cluster point is a limit point  Further  a uniformity is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded   Most generally  a Cauchy space is a set equipped with a class of filters declared to be Cauchy  These are required to have the following properties   for each x in X  the ultrafilter at x  U x   is Cauchy   if F is a Cauchy filter  and F is a subset of a filter G  then G is Cauchy   if F and G are Cauchy filters and each member of F intersects each member of G  then F ∩ G is Cauchy  The Cauchy filters on a uniform space have these properties  so every uniform space  hence every metric space  defines a Cauchy space   4  See also  Ultrafilter  Filtration  mathematics   Net  mathematics
