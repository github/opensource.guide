Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food  e g  phytonutrients  anthocyanins  tannins  etc   in relation to maintenance  growth  reproduction  health and disease of an organism  It includes food intake  absorption  assimilation  biosynthesis  energy metabolism  catabolism and excretion   The diet of an organism is what it eats  which is largely determined by the availability  processing and palatability of foods  A healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation  heat or leaching  and that reduce risk of food born illnesses   Registered Dietitians  RDs  or  RDNs   Registered Dietitian or Registered Dietitian Nutritionist  are health professionals qualified to provide safe  evidence based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten  a thorough review of nutritional health  and a personalized nutritional treatment plan  They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places  schools and similar institutions  Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs  are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease  including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs  Government regulation especially in terms of licensing  is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN   A poor diet may have an injurious impact on health  causing deficiency diseases such as scurvy and kwashiorkor  health threatening conditions like obesity and metabolic syndrome  and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease  diabetes  and osteoporosis   1  History  1 1  Antiquity  The first recorded dietary advice  carved into a Babylonian stone tablet in about 2500 BC  cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating onions for three days  Scurvy  later found to be a vitamin C deficiency  was first described in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus   According to Walter Gratzer  the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC  In China  the concept of Qi developed  a spirit or  wind  similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma  Food was classified into  hot   for example  meats  blood  ginger  and hot spices  and  cold   green vegetables  in China  India  Malaya  and Persia  Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi  Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements  Wu Xing  fire  water  earth  wood  and metal   and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets  About the same time in Italy  Alcmaeon of Croton  a Greek  wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out  and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation   Around 475 BC  Anaxagoras stated that food is absorbed by the human body and  therefore  contains  homeomerics   generative components   suggesting the existence of nutrients  Around 400 BC  Hippocrates  who recognized and was concerned with obesity  which may have been common in southern Europe at the time  said   Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food   The works that are still attributed to him  Corpus Hippocraticum  called for moderation and emphasized exercise   Salt  pepper and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar  In the 2nd century BC  Cato the Elder believed that cabbage  or the urine of cabbage eaters  could cure digestive diseases  ulcers  warts  and intoxication  Living about the turn of the millennium  Aulus Celsus  an ancient Roman doctor  believed in  strong  and  weak  foods  bread for example was strong  as were older animals and vegetables    1 2  Galen to Lind  One mustn t overlook the doctrines of Galen  In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century  it was heresy to disagree with him for 1500 years  Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon  and in Rome  physician to Marcus Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him  Most of Galen s teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by Benedictine monks at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum  which still had users in the 17th century  Galen believed in the bodily humours of Hippocrates  and he taught that pneuma is the source of life  Four elements  earth  air  fire and water  combine into  complexion   which combines into states  the four temperaments  sanguine  phlegmatic  choleric  and melancholic   The states are made up of pairs of attributes  hot and moist  cold and moist  hot and dry  and cold and dry   which are made of four humours  blood  phlegm  green  or yellow  bile  and black bile  the bodily form of the elements   Galen thought that for a person to have gout  kidney stones  or arthritis was scandalous  which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler s Erehwon  1872  where sickness is a crime  In the 1500s  Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly  Also in the 16th century  scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle  Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject  but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen  Ultimately  16th century works of Andreas Vesalius  sometimes called the father of modern medicine  overturned Galen s ideas  He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era s mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo  Jan Baptist van Helmont  who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide  performed the first quantitative experiment  Robert Boyle advanced chemistry  Sanctorius measured body weight  Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process  Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles   Sometimes overlooked during his life  James Lind  a physician in the British navy  performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747  Lind discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from scurvy  a deadly and painful bleeding disorder  Between 1500 and 1800  an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy  The discovery was ignored for forty years  after which British sailors became known as  limeys   The essential vitamin C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932   1 3  Lavoisier and modern science  Around 1770  Antoine Lavoisier discovered the details of metabolism  demonstrating that the oxidation of food is the source of body heat  He discovered the principle of conservation of mass  His ideas made the phlogiston theory of combustion obsolete   In 1790  George Fordyce recognized calcium as necessary for fowl survival  In the early 19th century  the elements carbon  nitrogen  hydrogen  and oxygen were recognized as the primary components of food  and methods to measure their proportions were developed   In 1816  François Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates  sugar   fat  olive oil   and water died evidently of starvation  but dogs also fed protein survived  identifying protein as an essential dietary component  William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates  fat  and protein  During the 19th century  Jean Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants  animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds   With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology  Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef boullion and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value  In the 1860s  Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein  showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen   In the early 1880s  Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors  whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice  developed beriberi  or endemic neuritis  a disease causing heart problems and paralysis   but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not  Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease   not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet  later understood as a cure    In 1896  Eugen Baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands  In 1897  Christiaan Eijkman worked with natives of Java  who also suffered from beriberi  Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact  Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice  discovering that food can cure disease  Over two decades later  nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1  also known as thiamine   1 4  From 1900 to the present  In the early 20th century  Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals  applying principles of physics in nutrition  In 1906  Wilcock and Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan is necessary for the survival of rats  He fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed to be essential for survival  but the rats died  A second group of rats were fed an amount of milk containing vitamins  Sir Frederick Hopkins recognized that there exist  accessory food factors  other than calories  protein  and minerals  as organic materials essential to health but that the body cannot synthesize  In 1907  Stephen M  Babcock and Edwin B  Hart conducted the single grain experiment  which took nearly four years to complete   Oxford University closed down its nutrition department after World War II because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944  In 1912  Casimir Funk coined the term vitamin  a vital factor in the diet  from the words  vital  and  amine   because these unknown substances preventing scurvy  beriberi  and pellagra  were thought then to be derived from ammonia  The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century  In 1913  Elmer McCollum discovered the first vitamins  fat soluble vitamin A  and water soluble vitamin B  in 1915  now known to be a complex of several water soluble vitamins  and named vitamin C as the then unknown substance preventing scurvy  Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B  In 1919  Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil  In 1922  Elmer McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil  but found that it still cured rickets  Also in 1922  H M  Evans and L S  Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy  originally calling it  food factor X  until 1925   In 1925  Hart discovered that trace amounts of copper are necessary for iron absorption  In 1927  Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus synthesized vitamin D  for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928  In 1928  Albert Szent Györgyi isolated ascorbic acid  and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy  In 1935  he synthesized it  and in 1937  he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts  Szent Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the citric acid cycle   In the 1930s  William Cumming Rose identified essential amino acids  necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize  In 1935  Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of cobalt  In 1936  Eugene Floyd DuBois showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake  In 1938  Erhard Fernholz discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and then he tragically disappeared  It was synthesised the same year by Paul Karrer   In 1940  rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by Elsie Widdowson and others  In 1941  the first Recommended Dietary Allowances  RDAs  were established by the National Research Council   In 1992  The U S  Department of Agriculture introduced the Food Guide Pyramid  In 2002  a Natural Justice study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior  In 2005  one inconclusive study found that obesity could be caused by adenovirus in addition to bad nutrition   World leaders are looking at alternatives like genetically modified foods to tackle the problem of world hunger and food shortages   2  Nutrients  The list of nutrients that people are known to require is  in the words of Marion Nestle   almost certainly incomplete   As of 2014  nutrients are thought to be of two types  macro nutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts  and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities  Dietary fiber  i e  non digestible material such as cellulose  here termed a micronutrient  is required  for both mechanical and biochemical reasons  although the exact reasons remain unclear  Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals  which are said to influence  or protect  some body systems  Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of  for instance  vitamins   Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient types  together with other substances  such as toxins of various sorts  Some nutrients can be stored internally  e g   the fat soluble vitamins   while others are required more or less continuously  Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or  in extreme cases  too much of a required nutrient  For example  both salt and water  both absolutely required  will cause illness or even death in excessive amounts   2 1  Macronutrients  The macronutrients are carbohydrates  fats  protein  and water  The macronutrients  excluding fiber and water  provide structural material  amino acids from which proteins are built  and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built  and energy  Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally  and in either case it is measured in Joules or kilocalories  often called  Calories  and written with a capital C to distinguish them from little  c  calories   Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately  4 kcal  of energy per gram  while fats provide 37 kJ  9 kcal  per gram  though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort  which vary substantially from instance to instance  Vitamins  minerals  fiber  and water do not provide energy  but are required for other reasons   Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon  hydrogen  and oxygen atoms  Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides  glucose  fructose  galactose  to complex polysaccharides  starch   Fats are triglycerides  made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone  Some fatty acids  but not all  are essential in the diet  they cannot be synthesized in the body  Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon  oxygen  and hydrogen  The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen containing amino acids  some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally  Some of the amino acids are convertible  with the expenditure of energy  to glucose and can be used for energy production  just as ordinary glucose  in a process known as gluconeogenesis  By breaking down existing protein  the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration  the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine  This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation   2 1 1  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides  disaccharides  or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer  sugar  units they contain  They constitute a large part of foods such as rice  noodles  bread  and other grain based products  Monosaccharides  disaccharides  and polysaccharides contain one  two  and three or more sugar units  respectively  Polysaccharides are often referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long  multiple branched chains of sugar units   Traditionally  simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly  and therefore to raise blood glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates  This  however  is not accurate  Some simple carbohydrates  e g   fructose  follow different metabolic pathways  e g   fructolysis  that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose  while  in essence  many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple carbohydrates  Glucose stimulates the production of insulin through food entering the bloodstream  which is grasped by the beta cells in the pancreas   2 1 2  Fat  A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids  containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms   bonded to a glycerol  They are typically found as triglycerides  three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone   Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved  Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms  whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double bonded  so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length  Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated  one double bond  or polyunsaturated  many double bonds   Furthermore  depending on the location of the double bond in the fatty acid chain  unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega 3 or omega 6 fatty acids  Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans isomer bonds  these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources  they are typically created in an industrial process called  partial  hydrogenation  There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat  Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid  catalpic acid  eleostearic acid and punicic acid  in addition to providing energy  represent potent immune modulatory molecules   Saturated fats  typically from animal sources  have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia  Unsaturated fats  e  g   vegetable oil  are considered healthier  while trans fats are to be avoided  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature  such as butter or lard   while unsaturated fats are typically liquids  such as olive oil or flaxseed oil   Trans fats are very rare in nature  and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health  but have properties useful in the food processing industry  such as rancidity resistance   2 1 2 1  Essential fatty acids  Most fatty acids are non essential  meaning the body can produce them as needed  generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so  However  in humans  at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet  An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids—seems also important for health  although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive  Both of these  omega  long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins  which have roles throughout the human body  They are hormones  in some respects  The omega 3 eicosapentaenoic acid  EPA   which can be made in the human body from the omega 3 essential fatty acid alpha linolenic acid  ALA   or taken in through marine food sources  serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins  e g   weakly inflammatory PGE3   The omega 6 dihomo gamma linolenic acid  DGLA  serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins  e g  anti inflammatory PGE1   whereas arachidonic acid  AA  serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins  e g  pro inflammatory PGE 2   Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega 6 linoleic acid  LA  in the human body  or can be taken in directly through food  An appropriately balanced intake of omega 3 and omega 6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins  which is one reason why a balance between omega 3 and omega 6 is believed important for cardiovascular health  In industrialized societies  people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils  which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega 6 fatty acids relative to omega 3 fatty acids   The conversion rate of omega 6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2  Omega 3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes  thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro inflammatory PGE2  made from AA  toward anti inflammatory PGE1  made from DGLA   Moreover  the conversion  desaturation  of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta 5 desaturase  which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin  up regulation  and glucagon  down regulation   The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed  along with some types of amino acid  can influence processes involving insulin  glucagon  and other hormones  therefore  the ratio of omega 3 versus omega 6 has wide effects on general health  and specific effects on immune function and inflammation  and mitosis  i e   cell division    2 1 3  Protein  Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body  e g  muscles  skin  and hair   They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body  Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids  which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur  these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein  such as the keratin in hair   The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins  protein retention  and to replace damaged proteins  maintenance   As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision  amino acids must be present in the diet  Excess amino acids are discarded  typically in the urine  For all animals  some amino acids are essential  an animal cannot produce them internally  and some are non essential  the animal can produce them from other nitrogen containing compounds   About twenty amino acids are found in the human body  and about ten of these are essential and  therefore  must be included in the diet  A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids  especially those that are essential  is particularly important in some situations  during early development and maturation  pregnancy  lactation  or injury  a burn  for instance   A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids  an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids   It is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources  e g   rice and beans  to make a complete protein source  and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions  However  complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body  Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis  The amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded   2 1 4  Water  Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms  including urine and feces  sweating  and by water vapour in the exhaled breath  Therefore it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids   Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration  However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source  The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read   An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food  Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods   More recent comparisons of well known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health  Therefore  to help standardize guidelines  recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority  EFSA  documents  2010    i  Food based dietary guidelines and  ii  Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes  ADI   These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed ” For healthful hydration  the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2 0 L day for adult females and 2 5 L day for adult males  These reference values include water from drinking water  other beverages  and from food  About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink  with the remaining 20% coming from food  Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed  with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals  for example  These values are estimated using country specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations  Other guidelines for nutrition also have implications for the beverages we consume for healthy hydration  for example  the World Health Organization  WHO  recommend that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake   The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations  Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption  the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity  Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated  The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non pregnant women  plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement  equal to 300 mL day  To compensate for additional fluid output  breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL day above the recommended intake values for non lactating women   For those who have healthy kidneys  it is somewhat difficult to drink too much water  but  especially in warm humid weather and while exercising  it is dangerous to drink too little  While overhydration is much less common than dehydration  it is also possible to drink far more water than necessary  which can result in water intoxication  a serious and potentially fatal condition  In particular  large amounts of de ionized water are dangerous   2 2  Micronutrients  The micronutrients are minerals  vitamins  fibers and phytochemicals   2 2 1  Minerals  Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms  other than the four elements carbon  hydrogen  nitrogen  and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules  The term  mineral  is archaic  since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet  Some are heavier than the four just mentioned  including several metals  which often occur as ions in the body  Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally  or at least as complex compounds  or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources  such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells   Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources  On the other hand  minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements  the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter   2 2 1 1  Macrominerals  Many elements are essential in relative quantity  they are usually called  bulk minerals   Some are structural  but many play a role as electrolytes  Elements with recommended dietary allowance  RDA  greater than 150  mg day are  in alphabetical order  with informal or folk medicine perspectives in parentheses    Calcium  a common electrolyte  but also needed structurally  for muscle and digestive system health  bone strength  some forms neutralize acidity  may help clear toxins  provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions   Chlorine as chloride ions  very common electrolyte  see sodium  below  Magnesium  required for processing ATP and related reactions  builds bone  causes strong peristalsis  increases flexibility  increases alkalinity   Phosphorus  required component of bones  essential for energy processing  Potassium  a very common electrolyte  heart and nerve health   Sodium  a very common electrolyte  in general not found in dietary supplements  despite being needed in large quantities  because the ion is very common in food  typically as sodium chloride  or common salt  Excessive sodium consumption can deplete calcium and magnesium  leading to high blood pressure and osteoporosis   Sulfur  for three essential amino acids and therefore many proteins  skin  hair  nails  liver  and pancreas   Sulfur is not consumed alone  but in the form of sulfur containing amino acids  2 2 1 2  Trace minerals  Many elements are required in trace amounts  usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes  Some trace mineral elements  RDA   200 mg day  are  in alphabetical order   Cobalt required for biosynthesis of vitamin B12 family of coenzymes  Animals cannot biosynthesize B12  and must obtain this cobalt containing vitamin in the diet  Copper required component of many redox enzymes  including cytochrome c oxidase  Chromium required for sugar metabolism  Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxine but also — it is presumed — for other important organs as breast  stomach  salivary glands  thymus  etc   see Extrathyroidal iodine   for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list  and sometimes classified with the macrominerals  Iron required for many enzymes  and for hemoglobin and some other proteins  Manganese  processing of oxygen   Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases  Nickel present in urease  Selenium required for peroxidase  antioxidant proteins   Vanadium  Speculative  there is no established RDA for vanadium  No specific biochemical function has been identified for it in humans  although vanadium is required for some lower organisms    Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase  liver alcohol dehydrogenase  and carbonic anhydrase  2 2 2  Vitamins  As with the minerals discussed above  some vitamins are recognized as organic essential nutrients  necessary in the diet for good health   Vitamin D is the exception  it can be synthesized in the skin  in the presence of UVB radiation   Certain vitamin like compounds that are recommended in the diet  such as carnitine  are thought useful for survival and health  but these are not  essential  dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds  Moreover  thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food  particularly in fresh vegetables   which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity  see below   however  experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive  Other essential nutrients that are not classified as vitamins include essential amino acids  see above   choline  essential fatty acids  see above   and the minerals discussed in the preceding section   Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions  including goitre  scurvy  osteoporosis  impaired immune system  disorders of cell metabolism  certain forms of cancer  symptoms of premature aging  and poor psychological health  including eating disorders   among many others  Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health  notably vitamin A   and for at least one vitamin  B6  toxicity begins at levels not far above the required amount  Deficient or excess levels of minerals can also have serious health consequences   2 2 3  Fiber  Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals  Like all carbohydrates  when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories  kilocalories  of energy per gram  However  in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility  Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose  a large carbohydrate polymer is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it  There are two subcategories  soluble and insoluble fiber  Whole grains  fruits  especially plums  prunes  and figs   and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber  There are many health benefits of a high fiber diet  Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it  Insoluble fiber  found in whole wheat flour  nuts and vegetables  especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines  which move digesta along the digestive tract  Soluble fiber  found in oats  peas  beans  and many fruits  dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines  This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar  Additionally  fiber  perhaps especially that from whole grains  is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes  and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes  The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain   2 2 4  Phytochemicals  Phytochemicals are chemical compounds that occur naturally in plants  phyto means  plant  in Greek   In general  the term is used to refer to those chemicals that may have biological significance  for example antioxidants   There is research interest in the health effects of phytochemicals  but to date there is no conclusive evidence  While many fruits and vegetables that happen to contain phytochemicals are thought to be components of a healthy diet  by comparison dietary supplements based on them have no proven health benefit   2 2 5  Other nutrients  In general  other micronutrients are more recent discoveries that have not yet been recognized as vitamins or as required  Phytochemicals may act as antioxidants  but not all phytochemicals are antioxidants   2 2 5 1  Antioxidants  As cellular metabolism energy production requires oxygen  potentially damaging  e g   mutation causing  compounds known as free radicals can form  Most of these are oxidizers  i e   acceptors of electrons  and some react very strongly  For the continued normal cellular maintenance  growth  and division  these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds  Recently  some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants  Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors  glutathione  Vitamin C   and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources  Vitamin C in humans  Vitamin A  Vitamin K  or produced by the body from other compounds  Beta carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body  Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight   Phytochemicals  Section Below  and their subgroup  polyphenols  make up the majority of antioxidants  about 4 000 are known  Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network  For example  Vitamin C can reactivate free radical containing glutathione or Vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself  Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals  Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals  Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development  Vitamin A is fat soluble and protects fat areas  Vitamin C is water soluble and protects those areas   When interacting with a free radical  some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound  Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radical s butterfly effect   Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health  later large clinical trials did not detect any benefit and suggested instead that excess supplementation may be harmful   2 2 5 2  Intestinal bacterial flora  It is now also known that animal intestines contain a large population of gut flora  In humans  these include species such as Bacteroides  L  acidophilus  and E  coli  among many others  They are essential to digestion  and are also affected by the food we eat  Bacteria in the gut perform many important functions for humans  including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of otherwise indigestible food  stimulating cell growth  repressing the growth of harmful bacteria  training the immune system to respond only to pathogens  producing vitamin B12  and defending against some infectious diseases   3  Healthy diets  3 1  Whole plant food diet  Heart disease  cancer  obesity  and diabetes are commonly called  Western  diseases because these maladies were once rarely seen in developing countries  An international study in China found some regions had virtually no cancer or heart disease  while in other areas they reflected  up to a 100 fold increase  coincident with shifts from diets that were found to be entirely plant based to heavily animal based  respectively  In contrast  diseases of affluence like cancer and heart disease are common throughout the developed world  including the United States  Adjusted for age and exercise  large regional clusters of people in China rarely suffered from these  Western  diseases possibly because their diets are rich in vegetables  fruits  and whole grains  and have little dairy and meat products  Some studies show these to be  in high quantities  possible causes of some cancers  There are arguments for and against this controversial issue   The United Healthcare Pacificare nutrition guideline recommends a whole plant food diet  and recommends using protein only as a condiment with meals  A National Geographic cover article from November 2005  entitled The Secrets of Living Longer  also recommends a whole plant food diet  The article is a lifestyle survey of three populations  Sardinians  Okinawans  and Adventists  who generally display longevity and  suffer a fraction of the diseases that commonly kill people in other parts of the developed world  and enjoy more healthy years of life   In sum  they offer three sets of  best practices  to emulate  The rest is up to you  In common with all three groups is to  Eat fruits  vegetables  and whole grains    The National Geographic article noted that an NIH funded study of 34 000 Seventh day Adventists between 1976 and 1988     found that the Adventists  habit of consuming beans  soy milk  tomatoes  and other fruits lowered their risk of developing certain cancers  It also suggested that eating whole grain bread  drinking five glasses of water a day  and  most surprisingly  consuming four servings of nuts a week reduced their risk of heart disease    3 2  The French  paradox   The French paradox is the observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease  despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats  A number of explanations have been suggested   Saturated fat consumption does not cause heart disease  Reduced consumption of processed carbohydrate and other junk foods   Regular consumption of red wine   Higher consumption of artificially produced trans fats by Americans  which has been shown to have greater lipoprotein effects per gram than saturated fat  However  statistics collected by the World Health Organization from 1990–2000 show that the incidence of heart disease in France may have been underestimated and  in fact  may be similar to that of neighboring countries   4  Animal nutrition  Nutritional science investigates the metabolic and physiological responses of the body to diet  With advances in the fields of molecular biology  biochemistry  nutritional immunology  molecular medicine and genetics  the study of nutrition is increasingly concerned with metabolism and metabolic pathways  the sequences of biochemical steps through which substances in living things change from one form to another   Carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting  with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods   The nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2%  while in fungi  animals  and bacteria it averages about 5% to 10%   Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose  while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize  All animals  diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need  up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest  Animal tissue contains chemical compounds  such as water  carbohydrates  sugar  starch  and fiber   amino acids  in proteins   fatty acids  in lipids   and nucleic acids  DNA and RNA   These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon  hydrogen  oxygen  nitrogen  phosphorus  calcium  iron  zinc  magnesium  manganese  and so on  All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations  e g  hormones  vitamins  phospholipids  hydroxyapatite    Animal tissue consists of elements and compounds ingested  digested  absorbed  and circulated through the bloodstream to feed the cells of the body  Except in the unborn fetus  the digestive system is the first system involved   Digestive juices break chemical bonds in ingested molecules  and modify their conformations and energy states  Though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged  digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods  Unabsorbed matter  along with some waste products of metabolism  is eliminated from the body in the feces   Studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments  as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all material excreted and eliminated from the body  in urine and feces   Comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body  The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period  during which all food and waste must be analyzed  The number of variables involved in such experiments is high  making nutritional studies time consuming and expensive  which explains why the science of animal nutrition is still slowly evolving   In particular  the consumption of whole plant foods slows digestion and allows better absorption  and a more favorable balance of essential nutrients per Calorie  resulting in better management of cell growth  maintenance  and mitosis  cell division   as well as better regulation of appetite and blood sugar   Regularly scheduled meals  every few hours  have also proven more wholesome than infrequent or haphazard ones   5  Plant nutrition  Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth  There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition  Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism  However  this principle does not account for the so called beneficial elements  whose presence  while not required  has clear positive effects on plant growth   A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to Liebig s law of the minimum is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it  There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients  besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air  and hydrogen  which is obtained from water   Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air  consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen  through their leaves  Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air  while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil   Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange  wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions  H+  into the soil through proton pumps  These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root  In the leaves  stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen  The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis   Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth s atmosphere  very few plants can use this directly  Most plants  therefore  require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow  This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen fixation process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria   Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely  partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone  Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms  and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high  Furthermore  deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element  and vice versa   6  Environmental Nutrition  Research in the field of nutrition has greatly contributed in finding out the essential facts about how environmental depletion can lead to crucial nutrition related health problems like contamination  spread of contagious diseases  malnutrition  etc  Moreover  environmental contamination due to discharge of agricultural as well as industrial chemicals like organocholrines  heavy metal  and radionucleotides may adversely affect the human and the ecosystem as a whole  As far as safety of the human health is concerned  then these environmental contaminants can reduce people s nutritional status and health  This could directly or indirectly cause drastic changes in their diet habits  Hence  food based remedial as well as preventive strategies are essential to address global issues like hunger and malnutrition and to enable the susceptible people to adapt themselves to all these environmental as well as socio economic alterations   7  Advice and guidance  7 1  U S  Government policies  In the US  dietitians are registered  RD  or licensed  LD  with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association  and are only able to use the title  dietitian   as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state  when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination  respectively  In California  registered dietitians must abide by the Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist  including unqualified dietitians  as this term is unregulated  Some states  such as the State of Florida  have begun to include the title  nutritionist  in state licensure requirements  Most governments provide guidance on nutrition  and some also impose mandatory disclosure labeling requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance   In the US  nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services  Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of MyPlate  which superseded the food pyramid  which replaced the Four Food Groups  The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  Committee hearings are often televised on C SPAN   The U S  Department of Health and Human Services provides a sample week long menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government  Canada s Food Guide is another governmental recommendation   7 2  Government programs  Federal and state governmental organizations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U S  Some programs include   The Family Nutrition Program  FNP  is a free nutrition education program serving low income adults around the U S  This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service’s  FNS  branch of the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program  The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education    ENFEP  is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa  Guam  Micronesia  Northern Marianas  Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands  It is designed to assist limited resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge  skills  attitudes  and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets  and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well being   An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is   a public private partnership between the state’s largest university system and largest health insurer  Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation  Launched in 2005  this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families  It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise   7 3  Education  Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries  In England and Wales  the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition  stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging  In many schools  a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments  In some American schools  students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes  Nutrition is offered at many schools  and  if it is not a class of its own  nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as  Life Skills  Independent Living  Single Survival  Freshmen Connection  Health etc  In many Nutrition classes  students learn about the food groups  the food pyramid  Daily Recommended Allowances  calories  vitamins  minerals  malnutrition  physical activity  healthful food choices  portion sizes  and how to live a healthy life   A 1985  US National Research Council report entitled Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate  Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate  required course  A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%   8  Nutrition literacy  At the time of this entry  we were not able to identify any specific nutrition literacy studies in the U S  at a national level  However  the findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy  NAAL  provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U S  NAAL introduced the first ever measure of  the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain  process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions  – an objective of Healthy People 2010 and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset  On a scale of below basic  basic  intermediate and proficient  NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy  44% have intermediate literacy  29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy  The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it   Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills  While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult  primarily because of methodological differences  Zoellner et al  suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U S  general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region  For example  only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA  The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region   These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems  Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices  a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances  limited or difficult access to healthful foods  and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living   The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting  More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non primary care settings in order to achieve better health outcomes   9  Malnutrition  Malnutrition refers to insufficient  excessive  or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism  In developed countries  the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption  In developing countries  malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge  In Mali the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics  ICRISAT  and the Aga Khan Foundation  trained women s groups to make equinut  a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe di dèguè  comprising peanut paste  honey and millet or rice flour   The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell  and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage   Although there are more organisms in the world who are malnourished due to insufficient consumption  increasingly more organisms suffer from excessive over nutrition  a problem caused by an over abundance of sustenance coupled with the instinctual desire  by animals in particular  to consume all that it can   Nutritionism is the view that excessive reliance on food science and the study of nutrition can lead to poor nutrition and to ill health  It was originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis  and was popularized by Michael Pollan  Since nutrients are invisible  policy makers rely on nutrition experts to advise on food choices  Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body  Pollan argues  nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today   9 1  Insufficient  In general  under consumption refers to the long term consumption of insufficient sustenance in relation to the energy that an organism expends or expels  leading to poor health   9 2  Excessive  In general  over consumption refers to the long term consumption of excess sustenance in relation to the energy that an organism expends or expels  leading to poor health and  in animals  obesity  It can cause excessive hair loss  brittle nails  and irregular premenstrual cycles for females   9 3  Unbalanced  When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients  the diet is said to be unbalanced   9 4  Illnesses caused by improper nutrient consumption  9 5  Mental agility  Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing long term habits of healthy eating have a positive effect on cognitive and spatial memory capacity  with potential to increase a student s ability to process and retain academic information   Some organizations have begun working with teachers  policymakers  and managed foodservice contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university level institutions  Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success  Currently  less than 10% of American college students report that they eat the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables daily  Better nutrition has been shown to have an impact on both cognitive and spatial memory performance  a study showed those with higher blood sugar levels performed better on certain memory tests  In another study  those who consumed yogurt performed better on thinking tasks when compared to those that consumed caffeine free diet soda or confections  Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior in mice as far back as 1951   There is limited research available that directly links a student s Grade Point Average  G P A   to their overall nutritional health  Additional substantive data is needed to prove that overall intellectual health is closely linked to a person s diet  rather than just another correlation fallacy   9 6  Mental disorders  Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major depression  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  and obsessive compulsive disorder  the four most common mental disorders in developed countries  Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid  each of which an omega 3 fatty acid contained in fish oil but not in flaxseed oil   vitamin B12  folic acid  and inositol   9 7  Cancer  Cancer is now common in developing countries  According to a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer   In the developing world  cancers of the liver  stomach and esophagus were more common  often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods  such as smoked or salted food  and parasitic infections that attack organs   Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco  Developed countries  tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a  Western lifestyle  — cancers of the colon  rectum  breast and prostate — that can be caused by obesity  lack of exercise  diet and age    9 8  Metabolic syndrome  Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle induced hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin function  i e   insulin resistance  as a decisive factor in many disease states  For example  hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation  which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and clot formation  i e   heart disease  and exaggerated cell division  i e   cancer   Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance  the so called metabolic syndrome  are characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity  elevated blood sugar  elevated blood pressure  elevated blood triglycerides  and reduced HDL cholesterol  The negative impact of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1 PGE2 balance may be significant   The state of obesity clearly contributes to insulin resistance  which in turn can cause type 2 diabetes  Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance  Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear  the exact  likely multifarious  causes of insulin resistance remain less clear  It is important to note that it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise  more regular food intake  and reducing glycemic load  see below  all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals  and thereby lower blood sugar levels in those with type 2 diabetes    Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone leptin  and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another  The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin leptin stimulation and fat storage  as a result of high intake of strongly insulin leptin stimulating foods and energy  Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain  however  insulin leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores  In addition  reduced leptin signalling to the brain may reduce leptin s normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate   There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors— such as intake of processed carbohydrates  total protein  fat  and carbohydrate intake  intake of saturated and trans fatty acids  and low intake of vitamins minerals—contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance  In any case  analogous to the way modern man made pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environment s ability to maintain homeostasis  the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the body s ability to maintain homeostasis and health  as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic    9 9  Hyponatremia  Excess water intake  without replenishment of sodium and potassium salts  leads to hyponatremia  which can further lead to water intoxication at more dangerous levels  A well publicized case occurred in 2007  when Jennifer Strange died while participating in a water drinking contest  More usually  the condition occurs in long distance endurance events  such as marathon or triathlon competition and training  and causes gradual mental dulling  headache  drowsiness  weakness  and confusion  extreme cases may result in coma  convulsions  and death  The primary damage comes from swelling of the brain  caused by increased osmosis as blood salinity decreases  Effective fluid replacement techniques include water aid stations during running cycling races  trainers providing water during team games  such as soccer  and devices such as Camel Baks  which can provide water for a person without making it too hard to drink the water   9 10  Antinutrient  Antinutrients are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients  Nutrition studies focus on antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages   9 11  Processed foods  Since the Industrial Revolution some two hundred years ago  the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature  Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness  whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled  These latter technologies include pasteurisation  autoclavation  drying  salting  and separation of various components  all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food  Pasteurisation and autoclavation  heating techniques  have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods  preventing epidemics of bacterial infection  But some of the  new  food processing technologies have downfalls as well   Modern separation techniques such as milling  centrifugation  and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food  yielding flour  oils  juices  and so on  and even separate fatty acids  amino acids  vitamins  and minerals  Inevitably  such large scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food  saving certain nutrients while removing others  Heating techniques may also reduce food s content of many heat labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals  and possibly other yet to be discovered substances  Because of reduced nutritional value  processed foods are often  enriched  or  fortified  with some of the most critical nutrients  usually certain vitamins  that were lost during processing  Nonetheless  processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole  fresh foods  regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches  potassium sodium  vitamins  fiber  and of intact  unoxidized  essential  fatty acids  In addition  processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids   A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population s health is the history of epidemics of beri beri in people subsisting on polished rice  Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine  causing beri beri  Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States  It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat treated  as suggested by Pasteur  to control bacterial disease  Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria  but it destroyed the vitamin C   As mentioned  lifestyle  and obesity related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world  There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development  The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy  and as such it is influential in political decisions  e g   nutritional recommendations  agricultural subsidising   In any known profit driven economy  health considerations are hardly a priority  effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf life is more the trend  In general  whole  fresh foods have a relatively short shelf life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods  Thus  the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive  but nutritionally superior  whole  fresh foods  and cheap  usually nutritionally inferior  processed foods  Because processed foods are often cheaper  more convenient  in both purchasing  storage  and preparation   and more available  the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition related health complications   10  See also  11  Notes and references  12  Bibliography  Curley  S   and Mark  1990   The Natural Guide to Good Health  Lafayette  Louisiana  Supreme Publishing  13  External links
