A MUD    originally Multi User Dungeon  with later variants Multi User Dimension and Multi User Domain   is a multiplayer real time virtual world  usually text based  MUDs combine elements of role playing games  hack and slash  player versus player  interactive fiction  and online chat  Players can read or view descriptions of rooms  objects  other players  non player characters  and actions performed in the virtual world  Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language  Traditional MUDs implement a role playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters  with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers  The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters  explore a fantasy world  complete quests  go on adventures  create a story by roleplaying  and advance the created character  Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons series of games   Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common  while many others have science fiction settings or are based on popular books  movies  animations  periods of history  worlds populated by anthropomorphic animals  and so on  Not all MUDs are games  some are designed for educational purposes  while others are purely chat environments  and the flexible nature of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from computer science research to geoinformatics to medical informatics to analytical chemistry  MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields  including communications  sociology  law  and economics  At one time  there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing   Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to players  some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items  while others charge a monthly subscription fee  MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients  or specialized MUD clients which are designed to improve the user experience  Numerous games are listed at various web portals  such as The Mud Connector   The history of modern massively multiplayer online role playing games  MMORPGs  like EverQuest and Ultima Online  and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by Second Life  traces directly back to the MUD genre  Indeed  before the invention of the term MMORPG  games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs  A number of influential MMORPG designers began as and or players  such as Raph Koster  Brad McQuaid  Matt Firor  and Brian Green  or were involved with early MUDs  like Mark Jacobs and J  Todd Coleman    1  Origins  Colossal Cave Adventure  created in 1975 by Will Crowther on a DEC PDP 10 computer  was the first widely used adventure game  The game was significantly expanded in 1976 by Don Woods  Also called Adventure  it contained many D&D features and references  including a computer controlled dungeon master   Inspired by Adventure  a group of students at MIT in the summer of 1977 wrote a game for the PDP 10 minicomputer  called Zork  it became quite popular on the ARPANET  Zork was ported  under the filename DUNGEN   dungeon    to FORTRAN by a programmer working at DEC in 1978   In 1978 Roy Trubshaw  a student at Essex University in the UK  started working on a multi user adventure game in the MACRO 10 assembly language for a DEC PDP 10  He named the game MUD  Multi User Dungeon   in tribute to the Dungeon variant of Zork  which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing  Trubshaw converted MUD to BCPL  the predecessor of C   before handing over development to Richard Bartle  a fellow student at Essex University  in 1980   MUD  better known as Essex MUD and MUD1 in later years  ran on the Essex University network until late 1987  becoming the first Internet multiplayer online role playing game in 1980  when Essex University connected its internal network to ARPANet  The game revolved around gaining points till one achieved the Wizard rank  giving the character immortality and special powers over mortals  The game became more widely accessible when a guest account was set up that allowed users on JANET  a British academic X 25 computer network  to connect on weekends and between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM on weekdays  MUD1 was reportedly closed down when Richard Bartle licensed MUD1 to CompuServe  and was getting pressure from them to close Essex MUD  This left MIST  a derivative of MUD1 with similar gameplay  as the only remaining MUD running on the Essex University network  becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity  MIST ran until the machine that hosted it  a PDP 10  was superseded in early 1991   During the Christmas of 1985  Neil Newell  an avid MUD1 player  started programming his own MUD called SHADES because MUD1 was closed down during the holidays  Starting out as a hobby  SHADES became accessible in the UK as a commercial MUD via British Telecom s Prestel and Micronet networks  A scandal on SHADES led to the closure of Micronet  as described in Indra Sinha s net memoir  The Cybergypsies   In 1985 Pip Cordrey gathered some people on a BBS he ran to create a MUD1 clone that would run on a home computer  The tolkienesque MUD went live in 1986 and was named MirrorWorld   1985 also saw the creation of Gods by Ben Laurie  a MUD1 clone that included online creation in its endgame  Gods became a commercial MUD in 1988   In 1985 CompuNet started a project named Multi User Galaxy Game as a Science Fiction alternative to MUD1 which ran on their system at the time  When one of the two programmers left CompuNet  the remaining programmer  Alan Lenton  decided to rewrite the game from scratch and named it Federation II  at the time no Federation I existed   The MUD was officially launched in 1989  Federation II was later picked up by AOL  where it became known simply as  Federation  Adult Space Fantasy   Federation later left AOL to run on its own after AOL began offering unlimited service   In 1978  around the same time Roy Trubshaw wrote MUD  Alan E  Klietz wrote a game called Milieu using Multi Pascal on a CDC Cyber 6600 series mainframe which was operated by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium  Klietz ported Milieu to an IBM XT in 1983  naming the new port Scepter of Goth  Scepter supported 10 to 16 simultaneous users  typically connecting in by modem  It was one of the first commercial MUDs  franchises were sold to a number of locations  Scepter was first owned and run by GamBit  of Minneapolis  Minnesota   founded by Bob Alberti  GamBit s assets were later sold to Interplay Productions  Interplay eventually went bankrupt   In 1984  Mark Peterson wrote The Realm of Angmar  beginning as a clone of Scepter of Goth  In 1994  Peterson rewrote The Realm of Angmar  adapting it to MS DOS  the basis for many dial in BBS systems   and renamed it Swords of Chaos  For a few years this was a very popular form of MUD  hosted on a number of BBS systems  until widespread Internet access eliminated most BBSes   In 1984  Mark Jacobs created and deployed a commercial gaming site  Gamers World  The site featured two games coded and designed by Jacobs  a MUD called Aradath  which was later renamed  upgraded and ported to GEnie as Dragon s Gate  and a 4X science fiction game called Galaxy  which was also ported to GEnie  At its peak  the site had about 100 monthly subscribers to both Aradath and Galaxy  GEnie was shut down in the late 1980s  although Dragon s Gate was later brought to America Online before it was finally released on its own  Dragon s Gate was closed on February 10  2007   In the summer of 1980 University of Virginia classmates John Taylor and Kelton Flinn wrote Dungeons of Kesmai  a six player game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons which used Roguelike ASCII graphics  They founded the Kesmai company in 1982 and in 1985 an enhanced version of Dungeons of Kesmai  Island of Kesmai  was launched on CompuServe  Later  its 2 D graphical descendant Legends of Kesmai was launched on AOL in 1996  The games were retired commercially in 2000   The popularity of MUDs of the Essex University tradition escalated in the USA during the late 1980s when affordable personal computers with 300 to 2400 bit s modems enabled role players to log into multi line Bulletin Board Systems and online service providers such as CompuServe  During this time it was sometimes said that MUD stands for  Multi Undergraduate Destroyer  due to their popularity among college students and the amount of time devoted to them   2  Spread  2 1  AberMUD  The first popular MUD codebase was AberMUD  written in 1987 by Alan Cox  named after the University of Wales  Aberystwyth  Alan Cox had played the original University of Essex MUD  and the gameplay was heavily influenced by it  AberMUD was initially written in B for a Honeywell L66 mainframe under GCOS3 TSS  In late 1988 it was ported to C  which enabled it to spread rapidly to many Unix platforms upon its release in 1989  AberMUD s popularity resulted in several inspired works  the most notable of which were TinyMUD  LPMud  and DikuMUD   2 2  TinyMUD  Monster was a multi user adventure game created by Richard Skrenta for the VAX and written in VMS Pascal  It was publicly released in November 1988  Monster was disk based and modifications to the game were immediate  Monster pioneered the approach of allowing players to build the game world  setting new puzzles or creating dungeons for other players to explore  Monster  which comprised about 60 000 lines of code  had a lot of features which appeared to be designed to allow Colossal Cave Adventure to work in it  Though there never were many network accessible Monster servers  it inspired James Aspnes to create a stripped down version of Monster which he called TinyMUD   TinyMUD  written in C and released in late 1989  spawned a number of descendants  including TinyMUCK and TinyMUSH  TinyMUCK version 2 contained a full programming language named MUF  Multi User Forth   while MUSH greatly expanded the command interface  To distance itself from the combat oriented traditional MUDs it was said that the  D  in TinyMUD stood for Multi User  Domain  or  Dimension   this  along with the eventual popularity of acronyms other than MUD  such as MUCK  MUSH  MUSE  and so on  for this kind of server  led to the eventual adoption of the term MU* to refer to the TinyMUD family  UberMUD  UnterMUD  and MOO were inspired by TinyMUD but are not direct descendants   2 3  LPMud  In 1989 LPMud was developed by Lars Pensjö  hence the LP in LPMud   Pensjö had been an avid player of TinyMUD and AberMUD and wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the gameplay of AberMUD  In order to accomplish this he wrote what is nowadays known as a virtual machine  which he called the LPMud driver  that ran the C like LPC programming language used to create the game world  Pensjö s interest in LPMud eventually waned and development was carried on by others such as Jörn  Amylaar  Rennecke  Felix  Dworkin  Croes  Tim  Beek  Hollebeek and Lars Düning  During the early 1990s  LPMud was one of the most popular MUD codebases  Descendants of the original LPMud include MudOS  DGD  SWLPC  FluffOS  and the Pike programming language  the latter the work of long time LPMud developer Fredrik  Profezzorn  Hübinette   2 4  DikuMUD  In 1990  the release of DikuMUD  which was inspired by AberMUD  led to a virtual explosion of hack and slash MUDs based upon its code  DikuMUD inspired numerous derivative codebases  including CircleMUD  Merc  ROM  SMAUG  and GodWars  The original Diku team comprised Sebastian Hammer  Tom Madsen  Katja Nyboe  Michael Seifert  and Hans Henrik Staerfeldt  DikuMUD had a key influence on the early evolution of the MMORPG genre  with EverQuest  created by avid DikuMUD player Brad McQuaid  displaying such Diku like gameplay that Verant developers were made to issue a sworn statement that no actual DikuMUD code was incorporated   2 5  Simutronics  In 1987 David Whatley  having previously played Scepter of Goth and Island of Kesmai  founded Simutronics with Tom and Susan Zelinski  In the same year they demonstrated a prototype of GemStone to GEnie  After a short lived instance of GemStone II  GemStone III was officially launched in February 1990  GemStone III became available on AOL in September 1995  followed by the release of DragonRealms in February 1996  By the end of 1997 GemStone III and DragonRealms had become the first and second most played games on AOL   3  Gameplay  The typical MUD will describe to you the room or area you are standing in  listing the objects  players and NPCs in the area  as well as all of the exits  To carry out a task the player would enter a text command such as take apple or attack dragon  Movement around the game environment is generally accomplished by entering the direction  or an abbreviation of it  in which the player wishes to move  for example typing north or just n would cause the player to exit the current area via the path to the north   MUD clients often contain functions which make certain tasks within a MUD easier to carry out  for example commands buttons which you can click in order to move in a particular direction or to pick up an item  There are also tools available which add hotkey activated macros to telnet and MUD clients giving the player the ability to move around the MUD using the arrow keys on their keyboard for example   4  Style  While there have been many variations in overall focus  gameplay and features in MUDs  some distinct sub groups have formed that can be used to help categorize different game mechanics  game genres and non game uses   4 1  Hack and Slash MUDs  Perhaps the most common approach to game design in MUDs is to loosely emulate the structure of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign focused more on fighting and advancement than role playing  When these MUDs restrict player killing in favor of player versus environment conflict and questing  they are labeled Hack and Slash MUDs  This may be considered particularly appropriate since  due to the room based nature of traditional MUDs  ranged combat is typically difficult to implement  resulting in most MUDs equipping characters mainly with close combat weapons  This style of game was also historically referred to within the MUD genre as  adventure games   but video gaming as a whole has developed a meaning of  adventure game  that is greatly at odds with this usage   4 2  Player versus player MUDs  Most MUDs restrict player versus player combat  often abbreviated as PK  Player Killing   This is accomplished through hard coded restrictions and various forms of social intervention  MUDs without these restrictions are commonly known as PK MUDs  Taking this a step further are MUDs devoted solely to this sort of conflict  called pure PK MUDs  the first of which was Genocide in 1992  Genocide ideas were influential in the evolution of player versus player online gaming   4 3  Roleplaying MUDs  Roleplaying MUDs  generally abbreviated as RP MUDs  encourage or enforce that players act out the role of their playing characters at all times  Some RP MUDs provide an immersive gaming environment  while others only provide a virtual world with no game elements  MUDs where roleplay is enforced and the game world is heavily computer modeled are sometimes known as Roleplay Intensive MUDs  or RPIMUDs  In many cases  Role Playing muds attempt to differentiate themselves from hack and slash types  by dropping the  MUD  name entirely  and instead using MUX  Multi User Experience  or MUSH  Multi User Shared Hallucination    4 4  Social MUDs  Social MUDs de emphasize game elements in favor of an environment designed primarily for socializing  They are differentiated from talkers by retaining elements beyond online chat  typically online creation as a community activity and some element of role playing  Often such MUDs have broadly defined contingents of socializers and roleplayers  Server software in the TinyMUD family  or MU*  is traditionally used to implement social MUDs   4 5  Talkers  A less known MUD variant is the talker  a variety of online chat environment typically based on server software like ew too or NUTS  Most of the early Internet talkers were LPMuds with the majority of the complex game machinery stripped away  leaving just the communication commands  The first Internet talker was Cat Chat in 1990  Avid users of talkers are called spods   4 6  Educational MUDs  Taking advantage of the flexibility of MUD server software  some MUDs are designed for educational purposes rather than gaming or chat  MicroMUSE is considered by some to have been the first educational MUD  but it can be argued that its evolution into this role was not complete until 1994  which would make the first of many educational MOOs  Diversity University in 1993  also the first educational MUD  The MUD medium lends itself naturally to constructionist learning pedagogical approaches  The Mud Institute  TMI  was an LPMud opened in February 1992 as a gathering place for people interested in developing LPMud and teaching LPC after it became clear that Lars Pensjö had lost interest in the project  TMI focussed on both the LPMud driver and library  the driver evolving into MudOS  the TMI Mudlib was never officially released  but was influential in the development of other libraries   4 7  Graphical MUDs  A graphical MUD is a MUD that uses computer graphics to represent parts of the virtual world and its visitors  A prominent early graphical MUD was Habitat  written by Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar for Lucasfilm in 1985  Graphical MUDs require players to download a special client and the game s artwork  They range from simply enhancing the user interface to simulating 3D worlds with visual spatial relationships and customized avatar appearances   Games such as Meridian 59  EverQuest  Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot were routinely called graphical MUDs in their earlier years  RuneScape was actually originally intended to be a text based MUD  but graphics were added very early in development  However  with the increase in computing power and Internet connectivity during the late nineties  and the shift of online gaming to the mass market  the term  graphical MUD  fell out of favor  being replaced by MMORPG  Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game  a term coined by Richard Garriott in 1997   5  Psychology and engagement  Sherry Turkle developed a theory that the constant use  and in many cases  overuse  of MUDs allows users to develop different personalities in their environments  She uses examples  dating back to the text based MUDs of the mid 1990s  showing college students who simultaneously live different lives through characters in separate MUDs  up to three at a time  all while doing schoolwork  The students claimed that it was a way to  shut off  their own lives for a while and become part of another reality  Turkle claims that this could present a psychological problem of identity for today s youths    A Story About A Tree  is a short essay written by Raph Koster regarding the death of a LegendMUD player named Karyn  raising the subject of inter human relationships in virtual worlds   Observations of MUD play show styles of play that can be roughly categorized  Achievers focus on concrete measurements of success such as experience points  levels  and wealth  Explorers investigate every nook and cranny of the game  and evaluate different game mechanical options  Socializers devote most of their energy to interacting with other players  and then there are Killers who focus on interacting negatively with other players  if permitted  killing the other characters or otherwise thwarting their play  Few players play only one way  or play one way all the time  most exhibit a diverse style  According to Richard Bartle   People go there as part of a hero s journey舒a means of self discovery    Research has suggested that various factors combine in MUDs to provide users with a sense of presence rather than simply communication   6  Grammatical usage and derived terms  As a noun  the word MUD is variously written MUD  Mud  and mud  depending on speaker and context  It is also used as a verb  with to mud meaning to play or interact with a MUD and mudding referring to the act of doing so  A mudder is  naturally  one who MUDs  Compound words and portmanteaux such as mudlist  mudsex  and mudflation are also regularly coined  Puns on the  wet dirt  meaning of  mud  are endemic  as with  for example  the names of the ROM  Rivers of MUD   MUCK  MUSH  and CoffeeMUD codebases and the MUD Muddy Waters   7  See
