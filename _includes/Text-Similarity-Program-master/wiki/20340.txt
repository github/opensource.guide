Mary was a programming language designed and implemented by RUNIT at Trondheim  Norway in the 1970s  It borrowed many features from ALGOL 68 but was designed for machine oriented programming   An unusual feature of its syntax was that expressions were constructed using the conventional infix operators  but all of them had the same precedence and evaluation went from left to right unless there were brackets  Assignment had the destination on the right and assignment was considered just another operator   Similar to C  several language features appear to have existed to allow programmers to produce reasonably well optimised code  despite a quite primitive code generator in the compiler  These included operators similar to the +  et alter in C and explicit register declarations for variables   Notable features    Dataflow syntax    values flow from left to right  including assignment   Most constructs could be used in expressions  blocks  IF  CASE  etc     Text based recursive macros   Overloaded user defined operators  not constrained to predefined identifiers as in C++   Automatic building and dereferencing of pointers from type context   Scalar range types   Array and set enumeration in loop iterators   Dynamic array descriptors  ROW   A book describing Mary was printed in 1974  Fourth and last edition in 1979   Mary Textbook by Reidar Conradi & Per Holager   Compilers were made for Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk s SM 4 and Norsk Data Nord 10 ND 100 mini computers  The original Mary compiler was written in NU ALGOL  ran on the Univac 1100 series and was used to bootstrap a native compiler for ND 100 SINTRAN III  RUNIT implemented a CHILL compiler written in Mary which ran on ND 100 and had Intel 8086 and 80286 targets  When this compiler was ported to the VAX platform  a common backend for Mary and CHILL was implemented  Later  backends for i386 and SPARC were available  Since the Mary compiler was implemented in Mary  it was possible to run the compiler on all these platforms   Mary is no longer maintained   1  Example  2  See also  ALGOL 68
