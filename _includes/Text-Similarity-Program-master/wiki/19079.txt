  1  Prehistory  2  Ancient period  In antiquity  most of the territory that is now the Republic of Macedonia was included in the kingdom of Paeonia  which was populated by the Paeonians  a people of Thracian origins  but also parts of ancient Illyria and Dardania  inhabited by various Illyrian peoples  and Lyncestis and Pelagonia populated by the ancient Greek Molossian tribes  None of these had fixed boundaries  they were sometimes subject to the Kings of Macedon  and sometimes broke away  In 336 BC Philip II of Macedon conquered Upper Macedonia  including its northern part and southern Paeonia  which both now lie within the Republic of Macedonia  Philip s son Alexander the Great conquered most of the remainder of the region  incorporating it in his empire  with exclusion of Dardania  The Romans included most of the Republic in their province of Macedonia  but the northernmost parts  Dardania  lay in Moesia  by the time of Diocletian  they had been subdivided  and the Republic was split between Macedonia Salutaris and Moesia prima   3  Medieval period  At this period the area divided from the Jireček Line was populated from people of Thraco Roman or Illyro Roman origins  as well from Hellenized citizens of the Byzantine Empire and Byzantine Greeks  The ancient languages of the local Thraco Illyrian people had already gone extinct before the arrival of the Slavs  and their cultural influence was highly reduced due to the repeated barbaric invasions on the Balkans during the early Middle Ages  accompanied by persistent hellenization  romanisation and later slavicisation  South Slavic tribes settled in the territory of the present day Republic of Macedonia in the 6th century  The Slavic settlements were referred to by Byzantine Greek historians as  Sklavines   The Sklavines participated in several assaults against the Byzantine Empire   alone or aided by Bulgars or Avars  Around 680 AD the Bulgar group  led by khan Kuber  who belonged to the same clan as the Danubian Bulgarian khan Asparukh   settled in the Pelagonian plain  and launched campaigns to the region of Thessaloniki   In the late 7th century Justinian II organized massive expeditions against the Sklaviniai of the Greek peninsula  in which he reportedly captured over 110 000 Slavs and transferred them to Cappadocia  By the time of Constans II  who also organized campaigns against the Slavs   the significant number of the Slavs of Macedonia were captured and transferred to central Asia Minor where they were forced to recognize the authority of the Byzantine emperor and serve in its ranks  Use of the name  Sklavines  as a nation on its own was discontinued in Byzantine records after circa 836 as those Slavs in the Macedonia region became a population in the First Bulgarian Empire  Originally two distinct peoples  Sklavines and Bulgars  the Bulgars assimilated the Slavic language identity whilst maintaining the Bulgarian demonym and name of the empire  Slavic influence in the region strengthened along with the rise of this state  which incorporated the entire region to its domain in AD 837  Saints Cyril and Methodius  Byzantine Greeks born in Thessaloniki  were the creators of the first Slavic Glagolitic alphabet and Old Church Slavonic language  They were also apostles Christianizators of the Slavic world  Their cultural heritage was acquired and developed in medieval Bulgaria  where after 885 the region of Ohrid became a significant ecclesiastical center with the nomination of the Saint Clement of Ohrid for  first archbishop in Bulgarian language  with residence in this region  In conjunction with another disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius  Saint Naum  he created a flourishing Bulgarian cultural center around Ohrid  where over 3 000 pupils were taught in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic script in what is now called Ohrid Literary School  At the end of the 10th century  much of what is now Republic of Macedonia became the political and cultural center of the First Bulgarian Empire under Tsar Samuil  while the Byzantine emperor Basil II came to rule the eastern part of the empire  what is now Bulgaria   including the then capital Preslav  in 972  A new capital was established at Ohrid  which also became the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate  From then on  the Bulgarian model became an integral part of wider Slavic culture as a whole  After several decades of almost incessant fighting  Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule in 1018  The whole of Macedonia was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire as Theme of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced in rank to an archbishopric   In the 13th and 14th centuries  Byzantine control was punctuated by periods of Bulgarian and Serbian rule  For example  Konstantin Asen   a former nobleman from Skopje   ruled as tsar of Bulgaria from 1257 to 1277  Later  Skopje became a capital of the Serbian Empire under Stefan Dušan  After the dissolution of the empire  the area became a domain of independent local Serbian rulers from the Mrnjavčević and Dragaš houses  The domain of the Mrnjavčević house included western parts of the present day Republic of Macedonia and domains of the Dragaš house included eastern parts  The capital of the state of Mrnjavčević house was Prilep  There are only two known rulers from the Mrnjavčević house   king Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his son  king Marko  King Marko became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire and later died in the Battle of Rovine   4  Ottoman period  Conquered by the Ottoman army in the first half of the 15th century  the region remained a part of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 500 years  during which it gained a substantial Turkish minority  especially in the religious sense of Muslim  some of those Muslims became so through conversions  During the Ottoman rule  Skopje and Monastir  Bitola  were capitals of separate Ottoman provinces  eyalets   The valley of the river Vardar  which was later to become the central area of the Republic of Macedonia  was ruled by the Ottoman Empire prior to the First Balkan War of 1912  with the exception of the brief period in 1878 when it was liberated from Ottoman rule after the Russo Turkish War  1877–78   becoming part of Bulgaria  In 1903  a short lived Kruševo Republic was proclaimed in the south western part of present day Republic of Macedonia by the rebels of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising  Most of the ethnographers and travellers during Ottoman rule classified Slavic speaking people in Macedonia as Bulgarians  Examples include the 17th century traveller Evliya Çelebi in his Seyahatname   Book of Travels to the Ottoman census of Hilmi Pasha in 1904 and later  However  they also remarked that the language spoken in Macedonia had somewhat of a distinctive character — often described as a  Western Bulgarian dialect  as other Bulgarian dialects in modern western Bulgaria  Evidence also exists that certain Macedonian Slavs  particularly those in the northern regions  considered themselves as Serbs  on the other hand the intention to join Greece predominated in southern Macedonia where it was supported by substantial part of the Slavic population  Although references are made referring to Slavs in Macedonia being identified as Bulgarians  some scholars suggest that ethnicity in Medieval times was more fluid than what we see it to be today  an understanding derived from nineteenth century nationalistic ideals of a homogeneous nation state   During the period of Bulgarian National Revival many Bulgarians from Vardar Macedonia supported the struggle for creation of Bulgarian cultural educational and religious institutions  including Bulgarian Exarchate   5  1912–1944  The region was captured by Serbia during First Balkan War of 1912 and was subsequently annexed to Serbia in the post war peace treaties  It had no administrative autonomy and was called Južna Srbija   Southern Serbia   or Stara Srbija   Old Serbia    After the First World War  the Kingdom of Serbia joined the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  In 1929  the kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and was divided into provinces called banovinas  The territory of Vardar Banovina had Skopje as its capital and it included what eventually became the modern Republic of Macedonia   After World War I  1914–1918  the Slavs in Serbian  Vardar  Macedonia were regarded as southern Serbs and the language they spoke a southern Serbian dialect  The Bulgarian  Greek and Romanian schools were closed  the Bulgarian priests and all non Serbian teachers were expelled  The policy of Serbianization in the 1920s and 1930s clashed with pro Bulgarian sentiment stirred by Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  IMRO  detachments infiltrating from Bulgaria  whereas local communists favoured the path of self determination   In 1925  D J  Footman  the British vice consul at Skopje  addressed a lengthy report for the Foreign Office  He wrote that  the majority of the inhabitants of Southern Serbia are Orthodox Christian Macedonians  ethnologically more akin to the Bulgarians than to the Serbs  He also pointed to the existence of the tendency to seek an independent Macedonia with Salonica as its capital  During World War II  the Vardar Banovina was occupied between 1941 and 1944 by Italian ruled Albania  which annexed the Albanian populated western regions  and pro German Bulgaria  which occupied the remainder  The occupying powers persecuted those inhabitants of the province who opposed the regime  this prompted some of them to join the Communist resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito  However  the Bulgarian army was partially recruited from the local population  which formed as much as 40% to 60% of the soldiers in certain battalions   6  1944–1949  Following World War II  Yugoslavia was reconstituted as a federal state under the leadership of Tito s Yugoslav Communist Party  When the former Vardar province was established in 1944  most of its territory was transferred into a separate republic while the northernmost parts of the province remained with Serbia  In 1946  the new republic was granted federal status as an autonomous  People s Republic of Macedonia  within the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  In the 1963 Constitution of Yugoslavia it was slightly renamed  to bring it in line with the other Yugoslav republics  as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia   Greece was concerned by the initiatives of the Yugoslav government  as they were seen as a pretext for future territorial claims against the Greek province of  Northern Greece  which formed the bulk of historical Macedonia and was also officially called  Macedonia   The Yugoslav authorities also promoted the development of the Macedonians  ethnic identity and Macedonian language  The Macedonian language was codified in 1944  Keith 2003   from the Slavic dialect spoken around Veles  This further angered both Greece and Bulgaria  because of the possible territorial claims of the new states to the Greek and Bulgarian parts of the region of Macedonia received after the Balkan Wars   During the Greek Civil War  1944–1949   many Macedonians  regardless of ethnicity  participated in the ELAS resistance movement organized by the Greek Communist Party  ELAS and Yugoslavia were on good terms until 1949  when they split due to Tito s lack of allegiance to Joseph Stalin  cf  Cominform   After the end of the war  the ELAS fighters who took refuge in southern Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were not all permitted by Greece to return  only those who considered themselves Greeks were allowed  whereas those who considered themselves Bulgarians or Macedonians were barred  These events also contributed to the bad state of Yugoslav Greek relations in Macedonia   7  Road to Republic  In 1990  the form of government peacefully changed from socialist state to parliamentary democracy  The first multi party elections were held on 11 and 25 November and 9 December 1990  After the collective presidency led by Vladimir Mitkov was dissolved  Kiro Gligorov became the first democratically elected president of the Republic of Macedonia on 31 January 1991  On 16 April 1991  the parliament adopted a constitutional amendment removing  Socialist  from the official name of the country  and on 7 June of the same year  the new name  Republic of Macedonia  was officially established   On 8 September 1991  the Republic of Macedonia held a referendum where 95 26% voted for independence from Yugoslavia  under the name of the Republic of Macedonia  The question of the referendum was formulated as  Would you support independent Macedonia with the right to enter future union of sovereign states of Yugoslavia    Macedonian  Дали сте за самостојна Македонија со право да стапи во иден сојуз на суверени држави на Југославија    On 25 September 1991 the Declaration of Independence was formally adopted by the Macedonian Parliament making the Republic of Macedonia an independent country   although in Macedonia independence day is still celebrated as the day of the referendum 8 September  A new Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia was adopted on 17 November 1991   Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the new state under its constitutional name  However  international recognition of the new country was delayed by Greece s objection to the use of what it considered a Hellenic name and national symbols  as well as controversial clauses in the Republic s constitution  To compromise  Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations under the provisional name of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  on 8 April 1993   Greece was still dissatisfied and it imposed a trade blockade in February 1994  The sanctions were lifted in September 1995 after Macedonia changed its flag and aspects of its constitution that were perceived as granting it the right to intervene in the affairs of other countries  The two neighbours immediately went ahead with normalizing their relations  but the state s name remains a source of local and international controversy  The usage of each name remains controversial to supporters of the other   After the state was admitted to the United Nations under the temporary reference  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia   other international organisations adopted the same convention  More than half of the UN s member states have recognised the country as the Republic of Macedonia  including the United States of America while the rest use the temporary reference  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  or have not established any diplomatic relations with Macedonia   In 1999  the Kosovo War led to 340 000 Albanian refugees from Kosovo fleeing into Macedonia  greatly disrupting normal life in the region and threatening to upset the balance between Macedonians and Albanians  Refugee camps were set up in Macedonia  Athens did not interfere with the Republic s affairs when NATO forces moved to and from the region ahead a possible invasion of FR Yugoslavia  Thessaloniki was the main depot for humanitarian aid to the region  The Republic did not become involved in the conflict   In end the war  Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević reached agreement with NATO which allowed refugees to return under UN protection  However  the war increased tensions and relations between ethnic Macedonians and Albanian Macedonians became strained  On the positive side  Athens and Ankara presented a united front of  non involvement   In Greece  there was a strong reaction against NATO and the United States   8  2000s  In the spring of 2001  ethnic Albanian insurgents calling themselves the National Liberation Army  some of whom were former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army  took up arms in the west of the Republic of Macedonia  They demanded that the constitution be rewritten to enshrine certain ethnic Albanian interests such as language rights  The guerillas received support from Albanians in NATO controlled Kosovo and ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the demilitarized zone between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia  The fighting was concentrated in and around Tetovo  the fifth largest city in the republic   After a joint NATO Serb crackdown on Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo  European Union  EU  officials were able to negotiate a cease fire in June  The government would give ethnic Albanians greater civil rights  and the guerrilla groups would voluntarily relinquish their weapons to NATO monitors  This agreement was a success  and in August 2001 3 500 NATO soldiers conducted  Operations Essential Harvest  to retrieve the arms  Directly after the operation finished in September the NLA officially dissolved itself  Ethnic relations have since improved significantly  although hardliners on both sides have been a continued cause for concern and some low level violence continues particularly directed against police   On 26 February 2004  President Boris Trajkovski died in a plane crash near Mostar  Bosnia and Herzegovina  The results of the official investigation revealed that the cause of the plane accident was procedural mistakes by the crew  committed during the approach to land at Mostar airport   In March 2004  the Republic of Macedonia submitted an application for membership of the EU  On 17 December 2005  EU Presidency conclusions listed the Republic of Macedonia as an accession candidate  It was expected that the EU would announce in late 2006 the date for commencement of EU accession negotiations   In August 2005  Poland became the 112th country  out of 191 total members of UN  to recognize Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name  A permanent agreement between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia s name has not yet been reached  The latest publicized proposal was  Republika Makedonija Skopje   with that spelling   but was rejected by the Republic of Macedonia  The UN mediator Matthew Nimetz proposed another form several months afterward  proposing that the name “Republika Makedonija” should be used by the countries that have recognized the country under that name and that Greece should use the formula “Republika Makedonija – Skopje”  while the international institutions and organizations should use the name “Republika Makedonia” in Latin alphabet transcription  but this form was rejected by Greece   9  See also  Breakup of Yugoslavia  History of Albania  History of the Balkans  History of Bulgaria
