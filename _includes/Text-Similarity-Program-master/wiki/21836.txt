The North Pole  also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole  is  subject to the caveats explained below  defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth s axis of rotation meets its surface  It should not be confused with the North Magnetic Pole   The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth  lying diametrically opposite the South Pole  It defines geodetic latitude 90° North  as well as the direction of true north  At the North Pole all directions point south  all lines of longitude converge there  so its longitude can be defined as any degree value   While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass  the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice  This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole  unlike the South Pole   However  the Soviet Union  and later Russia  constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937  some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole  Since 2002  the Russians have also annually established a base  Barneo  close to the Pole  This operates for a few weeks during early spring  Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice free due to Arctic ice shrinkage  with timescales varying from 2016 to the late 21st century or later   The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 and at 4 087 m  13 410 ft  by USS Nautilus in 1958  The nearest land is usually said to be Kaffeklubben Island  off the northern coast of Greenland about away  though some perhaps non permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer  The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert in the Qikiqtaaluk Region  Nunavut  Canada  which is located from the Pole   1  Precise definition  The Earth s axis of rotation – and hence the position of the North Pole – was commonly believed to be fixed  relative to the surface of the Earth  until  in the 18th century  the mathematician Leonhard Euler predicted that the axis might  wobble  slightly  Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent  variation of latitude   as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars  Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth s surface  by a range of a few meters  The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component  The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the 8 month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the Chandler wobble after its discoverer  The exact point of intersection of the Earth s axis and the Earth s surface  at any given moment  is called the  instantaneous pole   but because of the  wobble  this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole  or South Pole  when metre scale precision is required   It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates  latitude  longitude  and elevations or orography  to fixed landforms  Of course  given plate tectonics and isostasy  there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed  Yet the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service and the International Astronomical Union have defined a framework called the International Terrestrial Reference System   2  Exploration  2 1  Pre 1900  As early as the 16th century  many eminent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea  which in the 19th century was called the Polynya or Open Polar Sea  It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year  Several expeditions set out to find the way  generally with whaling ships  already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes   One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer William Edward Parry  who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North  In 1871 the Polaris expedition  a US attempt on the Pole led by Charles Francis Hall  ended in disaster  Another British Royal Navy attempt on the pole  part of the British Arctic Expedition  by Commander Albert H  Markham reached a then record 83°20 26  North in May 1876 before turning back  An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by US naval officer George W  DeLong ended tragically when their ship the USS Jeanette  was crushed by ice  Over half the crew  including DeLong  were lost   In April 1895 the Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen s icebound ship Fram  The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards  eventually reaching Franz Josef Land   In 1897 Swedish engineer Salomon August Andrée and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon Örnen   Eagle    but came down north of Kvitøya  the northeasternmost part of the Svalbard archipelago  They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months later  In 1930 the remains of this expedition were found by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition   The Italian explorer Luigi Amedeo  Duke of the Abruzzi and Captain Umberto Cagni of the Italian Royal Navy  Regia Marina  sailed the converted whaler Stella Polare   Pole Star   from Norway in 1899  On March 11  1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on April 25  setting a new record by beating Nansen s result of 1895 by   Cagni barely managed to return to the camp  remaining there until June 23  On August 16 the Stella Polare left Rudolf Island heading south and the expedition returned to Norway   2 2  1900–1940  The US explorer Frederick Cook claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two Inuit men  Ahwelah and Etukishook  but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted   The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer Robert Peary  who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909  accompanied by Matthew Henson and four Inuit men  Ootah  Seeglo  Egingwah  and Ooqueah  However  Peary s claim remains controversial  Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation  and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work  which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole   The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people  almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point  Peary s account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing – is contradicted by Henson s account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridges and open leads   The British explorer Wally Herbert  initially a supporter of Peary  researched Peary s records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer s navigational records  He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole  Support for Peary came again in 2005  however  when British explorer Tom Avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary s journey with replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams  reaching the North Pole in 36 days  22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary  However  Avery s fastest 5 day march was 90 nautical miles  significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary  Avery writes on his web site that  The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary  Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909  has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia  Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice  I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole    Another rejection of Peary s claim arrived in 2009  when E  Myles Standish of the California Institute of Technology  an experienced referee of scientific claims  reported numerous alleged lacunae and inconsistencies   The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by US naval officer Richard E  Byrd and pilot Floyd Bennett in a Fokker tri motor aircraft  Although verified at the time by a committee of the National Geographic Society  this claim has since been undermined by the 1996 revelation that Byrd s long hidden diary s solar sextant data  which the NGS never checked  consistently contradict his June 1926 report s parallel data by over   The secret report s alleged en route solar sextant data were inadvertently so impossibly overprecise that he excised all these alleged raw solar observations out of the version of the report finally sent to geographical societies five months later  while the original version was hidden for 70 years   a realization first published in 2000 by the University of Cambridge after scrupulous refereeing   According to Standish   Anyone who is acquainted with the facts and has any amount of logical reasoning can not avoid the conclusion that neither Cook  nor Peary  nor Byrd reached the North Pole  and they all knew it    The first consistent  verified  and scientifically convincing attainment of the Pole was on 12 May 1926  by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his US sponsor Lincoln Ellsworth from the airship Norge  Norge  though Norwegian owned  was designed and piloted by the Italian Umberto Nobile  The flight started from Svalbard in Norway  and crossed the Arctic Ocean to Alaska  Nobile  with several scientists and crew from the Norge  overflew the Pole a second time on 24 May 1928  in the airship Italia  The Italia crashed on its return from the Pole  with the loss of half the crew   In May 1937 the world s first North Pole ice station  North Pole 1  was established by Soviet scientists by air 20 kilometres  13 mi  from the North Pole  The expedition members  oceanographer Pyotr Shirshov  meteorologist Yevgeny Fyodorov  radio operator Ernst Krenkel  and the leader Ivan Papanin conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months  By 19 February 1938  when the group was picked up by the ice breakers Taimyr and Murman  their station had drifted 2850 km to the eastern coast of Greenland   2 3  1940–2000  In May 1945 an RAF Lancaster of the Aries expedition became the first Commonwealth aircraft to overfly the North Geographic and North Magnetic Poles  The plane was piloted by David Cecil McKinley of the Royal Air Force  It carried an 11 man crew  with Kenneth C  Maclure of the Royal Canadian Air Force in charge of all scientific observations  In 2006  Maclure was honoured with a spot in Canada s Aviation Hall of Fame   Discounting Peary s disputed claim  the first men to set foot at the North Pole were a Soviet party including geophysicists Mikhail Ostrekin and Pavel Senko  oceanographers Mikhail Somov and Pavel Gordienko  and other scientists and flight crew  24 people in total  of Aleksandr Kuznetsov s Sever 2 expedition  March–May 1948   It was organized by the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route  The party flew on three planes  pilots Ivan Cherevichnyy  Vitaly Maslennikov and Ilya Kotov  from Kotelny Island to the North Pole and landed there at 4 44pm  Moscow Time  UTC+04 00  on April 23  1948  They established a temporary camp and for the next two days conducted scientific observations  On April 26 the expedition flew back to the continent   Next year  on May 9  1949  two other Soviet scientists  Vitali Volovich and Andrei Medvedev  became the first people to parachute onto the North Pole  They jumped from a Douglas C 47 Skytrain  registered CCCP H 369   On May 3  1952  U S  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph O  Fletcher and Lieutenant William Pershing Benedict  along with scientist Albert P  Crary  landed a modified Douglas C 47 Skytrain at the North Pole  Some Western sources considered this to be the first landing at the Pole until the Soviet landings became widely known   The United States Navy submarine USS Nautilus  SSN 571  crossed the North Pole on August 3  1958  On March 17  1959 USS Skate  SSN 578  surfaced at the Pole  breaking through the ice above it  becoming the first naval vessel to do so   Setting aside Peary s claim  the first confirmed surface conquest of the North Pole was that of Ralph Plaisted  Walt Pederson  Gerry Pitzl and Jean Luc Bombardier  who traveled over the ice by snowmobile and arrived on April 19  1968  The United States Air Force independently confirmed their position   On April 6  1969  Wally Herbert and companions Allan Gill  Roy Koerner and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot  albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops   They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean – and by its longest axis  Barrow  Alaska to Svalbard – a feat that has never been repeated  Because of suggestions  later proven false  of Plaisted s use of air transport  some sources classify Herbert s expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means  In the 1980s  Plaisted s pilots Weldy Phipps and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided  It is also said that Herbert was the first person to reach the pole of inaccessibility   On August 17  1977  the Soviet nuclear powered icebreaker Arktika completed the first surface vessel journey to the North Pole   In 1982 Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R  Burton became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season  They departed from Cape Crozier  Ellesmere Island  on February 17  1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on April 10  1982  They travelled on foot and snowmobile  From the Pole  they travelled towards Svalbard but  due to the unstable nature of the ice  ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days  They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship MV Benjamin Bowring and boarded it on August 4  1982 at position 80 31N 00 59W  As a result of this journey  which formed a section of the three year Transglobe Expedition 1979–1982  Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles  by surface travel alone  This achievement remains unchallenged to this day   In 1985  Sir Edmund Hillary  the first man to stand on the summit of Mount Everest  and Neil Armstrong  the first man to stand on the moon  landed at the North Pole in a small twin engined ski plane  Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest   In 1986  Will Steger  with seven teammates  became the first to be confirmed as reaching the Pole by dogsled and without resupply   On May 6  1986  USS Archerfish  SSN 678   USS Ray  SSN 653  and USS Hawkbill  SSN 666  surfaced at the north pole  the first tri submarine surfacing at the North Pole   On April 21  1987  Shinji Kazama of Japan became the first person to reach the North Pole on a motorcycle   On May 18  1987  USS Billfish  SSN 676   USS Sea Devil  SSN 664  and HMS Superb  S 109  surfaced at the north pole  the first international surfacing at the North Pole   In 1988  a 13 man strong team  9 Soviets  4 Canadians  skied across the arctic from Siberia to northern Canada  One of the Canadians  Richard Weber became the first person to reach the Pole from both sides of the Arctic Ocean   On May 4  1990  Børge Ousland and Erling Kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the North Pole unsupported  after a 58 day ski trek from Ellesmere Island in Canada  a distance of 800 km   On September 7  1991  the German research vessel Polarstern and the Swedish icebreaker Oden reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels  Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe  Polarstern again reached the pole exactly 10 years later with the Healy   2 4  21st century  In recent years  journeys to the North Pole by air  landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice  or by icebreaker have become relatively routine  and are even available to small groups of tourists through adventure holiday companies  Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years  The temporary seasonal Russian camp of Barneo has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002  and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties  Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter   The first attempt at underwater exploration of the North Pole was made on April 22  1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of Moscow State University  but ended in fatality  The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club  and ended in success on April 24  1999  The divers were Michael Wolff  Austria   Brett Cormick  UK   and Bob Wass  USA    In 2005  the United States Navy submarine USS Charlotte  SSN 766  surfaced through of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there   In July 2007  British endurance swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh completed a swim at the North Pole  His feat  undertaken to highlight the effects of global warming  took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes  His later attempt to paddle a kayak to the North Pole in late 2008  following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole  was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days  The expedition was then abandoned   By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships  54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers  4 times by Swedish Oden  3 times by German Polarstern  3 times by USCGC Healy and USCGC Polar Sea  and once by CCGS Louis S  St Laurent and by Swedish Vidar Viking   2 4 1  2007 descent to the North Pole seabed  On August 2  2007  a Russian scientific expedition Arktika 2007 made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole  to a depth of   as part of the research programme in support of Russia s 2001 extended continental shelf claim to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor  The descent took place in two MIR submersibles and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer Artur Chilingarov  In a symbolic act of visitation  the Russian flag was placed on the ocean floor exactly under the Pole   The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the Arctic according to the New York Times  The warming Arctic climate and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries  such as China and the United States  toward the top of the world  where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable   2 4 2  MLAE 2009 Expedition  In 2009  the Russian Marine Live Ice Automobile Expedition—MLAE 2009  Vasily Elagin as a leader  and a team of Sergey Larin  Afanasy Makovnev  Vladimir Obikhod  Alexey Ushakov  Alexey Shkrabkin  and Nikolay Nikulshin  reached the North Pole on two custom built 6 x 6 low pressure tire ATVs—Yemelya 1 and Yemelya 2—designed by Vasily Elagin  a known Russian mountain climber  explorer  and engineer  The vehicles reached the North Pole on April 26  2009  17 30  Moscow time   The expedition was supported by the Russian Geographical Society  The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip to the Geographical North Pole   2 4 3  MLAE 2013 Expedition  On March 1  2013  the Russian Marine Live Ice Automobile Expedition — MLAE 2013  Vasily Elagin as a leader  and a team of Andrey Vankov  Sergey Isayev  Nikolay Kozlov  Afanasy Makovnev  Vladimir Obikhod  and Alexey Shkrabkin  on two custom built 6 x 6 low pressure tire ATVs—Yemelya 3 and Yemelya 4—started from Golomyanny Island  the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago  to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean  The vehicles reached the Pole on April 6 and then continued to the Canadian coast  The coast was reached on April 30  2013  83°08N  075°59W   and on May 5  2013  the expedition finished in Resolute Bay  NU  The way between the Russian borderland  Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago  80°15N  097°27E  and the Canadian coast  83°08N  075°59W  took 55 days  it was ~2300 km across drifting ice and about 4000 km in total  The expedition was totally self dependent and used no external supplies  The expedition was supported by the Russian Geographical Society   3  Day and night  The sun at the North Pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter  Sunrise is just before the March equinox  around March 20   the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer solstice  around June 21   after which time it begins to sink  reaching sunset just after the September equinox  around September 23   When the sun is visible in the polar sky  it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon  This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation  in degrees  above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox   A civil twilight period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset  a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset   These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth s axial tilt and its revolution around the sun  The direction of the Earth s axial tilt  as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth s orbit around the sun  remains very nearly constant over the course of a year  both change very slowly over long time periods   At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent  As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun  the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent  A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole  with a six month time difference   4  Time  In most places on Earth  local time is determined by longitude  such that the time of day is more or less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky  for example  at midday the sun is roughly at its highest   This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole  where the sun rises and sets only once per year  and all lines of longitude  and hence all time zones  converge  There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned  Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient  such as Greenwich Mean Time  or the time zone of the country from which they departed   5  Climate  The North Pole is substantially warmer than the South Pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean  which acts as a reservoir of heat   rather than at altitude in a continental land mass   Winter  January  temperatures at the North Pole can range from about to   perhaps averaging around   Summer temperatures  June  July and August  average around the freezing point     The highest temperature yet recorded is   much warmer than the South Pole s record high of only    The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around thick  although ice thickness  its spatial extent  and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate  Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years  It is likely that global warming has contributed to this  but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic  Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer  This may have significant commercial implications  see  Territorial Claims   below   The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming  as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation  and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation   6  Flora and fauna  Polar bears are believed rarely to travel beyond about 82° North owing to the scarcity of food  though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole  and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just from the Pole  The ringed seal has also been seen at the Pole  and Arctic foxes have been observed less than away at 89°40′ N   Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the Snow Bunting  Northern Fulmar and Black legged Kittiwake  though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions   Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole  but these are probably few in number  A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there  However  it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimps and amphipods   7  Territorial claims to the North Pole and Arctic regions  Currently  under international law  no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it  The five surrounding Arctic countries  Russian Federation  the biggest country   Canada  Norway  Denmark  via Greenland   and the United States  are limited to a exclusive economic zone around their coasts  and the area beyond that is administered by the International Seabed Authority   Upon ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 mile exclusive economic zone  If validated  such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone  Norway  ratified the convention in 1996   Russia  ratified in 1997   Canada  ratified in 2003  and Denmark  ratified in 2004  have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation   In 1907 Canada invoked a  sector principle  to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole  This claim has not been relinquished  but was not consistently pressed until 2013   However  in 2014  Denmark claimed part of the sea bed  including the north pole   8  Cultural associations  In some Western cultures  the geographic North Pole is described as the location of Santa Claus  workshop and residence  although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole  Canada Post has assigned postal code H0H 0H0 to the North Pole  referring to Santa s traditional exclamation of  Ho ho ho      This association reflects an age old esoteric mythology of Hyperborea that posits the North Pole  the otherworldly world axis  as the abode of God and superhuman beings  see Joscelyn Godwin s Arktos  The Polar Myth  1993    The popular figure of the pole dwelling Santa Claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence   As Henry Corbin has documented  the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of Sufism and Iranian mysticism   The Orient sought by the mystic  the Orient that cannot be located on our maps  is in the direction of the north  beyond the north    Owing to its remoteness  the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient Islamic tradition called Mount Qaf  Jabal Qaf   the  farthest point of the earth   According to certain authors  the Jabal Qaf of Muslim cosmology is a version of Rupes Nigra  a mountain whose ascent  like Dante s climbing of the Mountain of Purgatory  represents the pilgrim s progress through spiritual states  In Iranian theosophy  the heavenly Pole  the focal point of the spiritual ascent  acts as a magnet to draw beings to its  palaces ablaze with immaterial matter    9  See also  Arctic  Arctic cooperation and politics  Arctic Council  Biome  Celestial pole  Drifting ice station
