The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist bomb attack on the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19  1995  Carried out by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols  the bombing killed 168 people and injured more than 680 others  The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 16 block radius  destroyed or burned 86 cars  and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings  causing at least an estimated $652 million worth of damage  Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local  state  federal  and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing  and substantial donations were received from across the country  The Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces  consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations   Within 90 minutes of the explosion  McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession  Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack  Nichols was arrested  and within days both were charged  Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices  McVeigh  an American militia movement sympathizer who was a Gulf War veteran  had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building  McVeigh s co conspirator  Nichols  had assisted in the bomb preparation  Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by its handling of the 1993 Waco siege and the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992  McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at Waco   The official investigation  known as  OKBOMB   saw FBI agents conduct 28 000 interviews  amass of evidence  and collect nearly one billion pieces of information  The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997  McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11  2001  and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison  Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols  Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the U S  government  and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony   As a result of the bombing  the U S  Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States  as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks  On April 19  2000  the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building  commemorating the victims of the bombing  Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred   1  Planning  1 1  Motivation  The chief conspirators  Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols  met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U S  Army  Michael Fortier  McVeigh s accomplice  was his Army roommate  The three shared interests in survivalism  They expressed anger at the federal government s handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge as well as the Waco siege—a 1993 51 day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight  it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot  and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others  In March 1993  McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff  and then again after its conclusion  McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids   1 2  Target selection  McVeigh initially intended only to destroy a federal building  but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing  McVeigh s criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies  the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  ATF   the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   or the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA   He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies  such as the Secret Service or the U S  Marshals Service  as a bonus   McVeigh  a resident of Kingman  Arizona  considered targets in Missouri  Arizona  Texas  and Arkansas  McVeigh stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize nongovernmental casualties  so he ruled out a 40 story government building in Little Rock  Arkansas  because of the presence of a florist s shop on the ground floor  In December 1994  McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh s target  the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant  The Sword  and the Arm of the Lord  including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell  The group had plotted to park  a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer   After Snell s appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied  he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing   The nine story building  built in 1977  was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies including the DEA  ATF  Social Security Administration  and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps  The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast—and its adjacent large  open parking lot across the street  which might absorb and dissipate some of the force  and protect the occupants of nearby non federal buildings  In addition  McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes  The attack was planned to take place on April 19  1995  to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco Siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord   1 3  Gathering materials  McVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb  which they stored in rented sheds  In August 1994  McVeigh obtained nine Kinestiks from gun collector Roger E  Moore  and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols  home in Herington  Kansas  On September 30  1994  Nichols bought forty bags of ammonium nitrate from Mid Kansas Coop in McPherson  Kansas  this would be enough to fertilize 4 25 acres of farmland at a rate of 160 pounds of nitrogen per acre  an amount commonly used for corn  2000 pounds of AN divided by  160 lb acre divided by 0 34 lb N lb AN  equals 4 25 acres   Nichols bought an additional bag on October 18  1994  McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project  but he refused   They allegedly robbed gun collector Roger E  Moore in his home of $60 000 worth of guns  gold  silver  and jewels  transporting the property in the victim s own van  McVeigh had previously visited Moore s ranch  but doubts have been raised about Nichols and McVeigh s involvement in the robbery for several reasons  The robbers wore ski masks  making a positive identification impossible   and the physical description given did not match Nichols  Also  Aryan Republican Army robbers were operating in the area of Moore s ranch at the time  McVeigh did not need to raise money for the bomb  which only cost about $5 000  In all  the truck rental cost about $250  the fertilizer less than $500  and the nitromethane $2 780  with a cheap car being used as a getaway vehicle  McVeigh wrote a letter to Moore in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents  Despite these doubts  items that were stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols  home and in a storage shed that he had rented   In October 1994  McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife  Lori  a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build  McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate fertilizer  mixed with about of liquid nitromethane and of Tovex  Including the weight of the sixteen 55 U S  gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed  the bomb would have a combined weight of about   McVeigh had originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel  but it proved to be too expensive  In October 1994  posing as a motorcycle racer  McVeigh obtained three drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing   McVeigh rented a storage space  in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18 inch long Tovex sausages  80 spools of shock tube  and 500 electric blasting caps  which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion  Kansas  He decided not to steal any of the of ANFO  ammonium nitrate fuel oil  he found at the scene  as he did not believe it to be powerful enough  although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb   McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills  liquid nitromethane  a piece of Tovex sausage  and a blasting cap  The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection   Later  speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations  he said   You learn how to handle killing in the military  I face the consequences  but you learn to accept it   He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor  reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost   On April 14  1995  McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City  Kansas  The following day he rented a 1993 Ford F 700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D  Kling  an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics  and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of Star Trek  On April 16  1995  he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  The nearby Regency Towers Apartments  lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols  pickup truck as it drove to the federal building  After removing the license plate from the car  he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number  VIN  plate that read   Not abandoned  Please do not tow  Will move by April 23   Needs battery & cable    Both men then returned to Kansas   1 4  Building the bomb  On April 17舑18  1995  McVeigh and Nichols removed their supplies from their storage unit in Herington  Kansas  where Nichols lived  They loaded their bomb supplies into a Ryder rental truck  The two then drove to Geary Lake State Park  where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale  Each filled barrel weighed nearly   McVeigh added more explosives to the driver s side of the cargo bay  which he could ignite  killing himself in the process  at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed  During McVeigh s trial  Lori Fortier  the wife of Michael Fortier  stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge  This was achieved by tamping the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building  Specifically  McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J  he later said that for pure destructive power  he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building  however  such an unevenly distributed load might have broken an axle  flipped the truck over  or at least caused it to lean to one side  which could have drawn attention  All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion   McVeigh then added a dual fuse ignition system accessible from the truck s front cab  He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat  while two holes were also drilled in the body of the truck  One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab  These time delayed fuses led from the cab of the truck  through plastic fish tank tubing conduit  to two sets of non electric blasting caps which would ignite around 350 pounds of high grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry  The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck s livery  and duct taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside  The fuses were set up to initiate  through shock tubes  the of Tovex Blastrite Gel  sausages   which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels  Of the 13 filled barrels  nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane  and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel  Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast  After finishing the truck bomb  the two men separated  Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City   2  Bombing  McVeigh s original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11 00 am  but at dawn on April 19  1995  he decided instead to destroy the building at 9 00 am  As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck  McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries—a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9 15 one morning using a truck bomb  McVeigh wore a printed T shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia  Sic semper tyrannis   Thus always to tyrants   according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar  also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln  and  The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants   from Thomas Jefferson   He also carried an envelope of anti government materials that included a bumper sticker with Thomas Jefferson slogan   When the government fears the people  there is liberty  When the people fear the government  there is tyranny   Underneath  McVeigh had written   Maybe now  there will be liberty   and a hand copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty   McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8 50 am  At 8 57 am  the Regency Towers Apartments  lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols  pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building  At the same moment  McVeigh lit the five minute fuse  Three minutes later  still a block away  he lit the two minute fuse  He parked the Ryder truck in a drop off zone situated under the building s day care center  exited and locked the truck  and as he headed to his getaway vehicle  dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away   At 9 02 am  14 02 UTC   the Ryder truck  containing in excess of of ammonium nitrate fertilizer  nitromethane  and diesel fuel mixture  detonated in front of the north side of the nine story Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  Hundreds of people were killed or injured  One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion  which created a wide  deep crater on NW 5th Street next to the building  The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 16 block radius  and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings  The broken glass alone accounted for 5% of the death total and 69% of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building  The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site  The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down multiple offices in downtown Oklahoma City  The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage   The effects of the blast were equivalent to over of TNT  and could be heard and felt up to away  Seismometers at Science Museum Oklahoma in Oklahoma City  away  and in Norman  Oklahoma  away  recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3 0 on the Richter scale   3  Arrests  Initially  the FBI had three hypotheses regarding who might have been responsible for the bombing  The first was international terrorists  possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier  The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office  The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti government right wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government   McVeigh was arrested within 90 minutes of the explosion  as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County  Oklahoma  Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate  and arrested him for having a concealed weapon  For his home address  McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols  brother James  house in Michigan  After booking McVeigh into jail  Hanger searched his police car and found a business card McVeigh had hidden while he was handcuffed  Written on the back of the card  which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store  were the words  TNT at $5 a stick  Need more   The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh s trial   While investigating the VIN from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate  federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City  Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot  owner of the agency  the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing  McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel  who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot  McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel  using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station  Before signing his real name at the motel  McVeigh had used false names for his transactions  However  McGown noted   People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name  they almost always go to write  and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use  That s what  McVeigh  did  and when he looked up I started talking to him  and it threw him    After an April 21  1995  court hearing on the gun charges  but before McVeigh s release  federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing  Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing  McVeigh demanded an attorney  Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside  a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail  While McVeigh s requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied  authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City   Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh s father  Bill  following which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices  FBI investigators used the resulting information gained  along with the fake address McVeigh had been using  to begin their search for the Nichols brothers  Terry and James  On April 21  1995  Terry learned that he was being hunted  and turned himself in  Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home  ammonium nitrate and blasting caps  the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry  books on bomb making  a copy of Hunter  a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce  the founder and chairman of the white nationalist National Alliance  and a hand drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City  on which was marked the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh s getaway car was hidden  After a nine hour interrogation  Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial  On April 25  1995  James Nichols was also arrested  but he was released after 32 days due to lack of evidence  McVeigh s sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh  but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him   Ibrahim Ahmad  a Jordanian American traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19  1995  was also arrested in what was described as an  initial dragnet   There was concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been behind the attack  Further investigation cleared Ahmad of any involvement in the bombing   4  Casualties  An estimated 646 people were inside the building when the bomb exploded  By the end of the day  14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead  and over 100 injured  The toll eventually reached 168 confirmed dead  not including an unmatched leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim  Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building  rather than the bomb blast itself  Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  one person in the Athenian Building  one woman in a parking lot across the street  a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building  and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris   The victims  including three pregnant women  ranged in age from 3 months to 73 years  Of the dead  99 worked for the federal government  Eight of the victims were federal law enforcement agents  four from the United States Secret Service  two from the United States Customs Service  one from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration  and one from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development  Nineteen of the victims were children  15 of whom were in the America s Kids Day Care Center  The bodies of the 168 victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene  A team of 24 identified the victims using full body X rays  dental examinations  fingerprinting  blood tests  and DNA testing  More than 680 people were injured  The majority of the injuries were abrasions  severe burns  and bone fractures   McVeigh later justified his killing of children in the bombing   I didn t define the rules of engagement in this conflict  The rules  if not written down  are defined by the aggressor  It was brutal  no holds barred  Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge  You put back in  the government s  faces exactly what they re giving out    5  Response and relief  5 1  Rescue efforts  At 9 03 25 am  the first of over 1 800 9 1 1 calls related to the bombing was received by Emergency Medical Services Authority  EMSA   By that time  EMSA ambulances  police  and firefighters were already headed to the scene  having heard the blast  Nearby civilians  who had also witnessed or heard the blast  arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers  Within 23 minutes of the bombing  the State Emergency Operations Center  SEOC  was set up  consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety  human services  military  health  and education  Assisting the SEOC were agencies such as the National Weather Service  the Air Force  the Civil Air Patrol  and the American Red Cross  Immediate assistance also came from 465 members of the Oklahoma National Guard  who arrived within the hour to provide security  and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management   The EMS command post was set up almost immediate following the attack and oversaw triage  treatment  transportation  and decontamination  A simple plan objective was established  treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible  supplies and personnel to handle a large amount of patients was needed immediately  the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner s office  and measures for a long term medical operation needed to be established  The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there  Treatment and transport of the injured was done at a furious pace  210 patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing   Within the first hour  50 people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building  Victims were sent to every hospital in the area  At the end of the first day of rescue efforts  153 had been treated at St  Anthony Hospital  eight blocks from the blast  over 70 at Presbyterian  41 at University  and 18 at Children s  Temporary silences were observed so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors  In some cases  limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics  avoided because of its potential to cause a deadly coma  in order to free those trapped under rubble  Periodically the scene had to be evacuated after police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building   At 10 28 am  rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb  Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacuation of a four block area around the site  The device was determined to be a three foot   9 m  long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb sniffing dogs  although actually inert  it had been marked  live  in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting  On examination the missile was determined to be inert  and relief efforts resumed 45 minutes later  The last survivor  a fifteen year old girl found under the base of the collapsed building  was rescued at around 7 00 pm   In the days following the blast  over 12 000 people participated in relief and rescue operations  The Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces  which consisted of a team of 665 rescue workers  One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris  and 26 other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries  Twenty four K 9 units and out of state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris  In an effort to recover additional bodies  of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to April 29  1995   Rescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12 05 am on May 5  by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered  For safety reasons  the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward  McVeigh s attorney  Stephen Jones  filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial  At 7 02 am on May 23  more than a month after the bombing  the Murrah Federal building was demolished  The EMS Command Center remained active until the demolition of the Federal Murrah Building and was staffed 24 hours a day  The final three bodies  those of two credit union employees and a customer  were recovered  For several days after the building s demolition  trucks hauled of debris a day away from the site  Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators  trials  incorporated into memorials  donated to local schools  or sold to raise funds for relief efforts   5 2  Humanitarian aid  The national humanitarian response was immediate  and in some cases even overwhelming  Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows  bottled water  helmet lights  knee pads  rain gear  and even football helmets were donated  The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods  The Oklahoma Restaurant Association  which was holding a trade show in the city  assisted rescue workers by providing 15 000 to 20 000 meals over a ten day period   The Salvation Army served over 100 000 meals and provided over 100 000 ponchos  gloves  hard hats  and knee pads to rescue workers  Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations  Of the over 9 000 units of blood donated 131 units were used  the rest were stored in blood banks   5 3  Federal and state government aid  At 9 45 am  Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety  President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9 30 am while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller at the White House  Prior to addressing the nation  President Clinton wanted to ground all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air  but decided against it  At 4 00 pm  President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation  He ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half staff for 30 days in remembrance of the victims  Four days later  on April 23  1995  Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City   No major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing  but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300 000 in federal grants  Over $40 million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims  Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet  and the rest was held in trust for longer term medical and psychological needs  By 2005  $18 million of the donations remained  some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing  A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors   5 4  International reaction  International reactions to the bombing varied  President Clinton received many messages of sympathy  including those from Queen Elizabeth&nbsp II of the United Kingdom  Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization  and Narasimha Rao of India  Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people  but also blamed U S  policy for inciting it  Kuwaiti parliament member Ahmed Baqer stated  This is a criminal act  No religion and no law permit such acts  A lot of civilians and children were killed  This is against human rights  This is against logic  We as a movement reject this kind of action   Other condolences came from Russia  Canada  Australia  the United Nations  and the European Union  among other nations and organizations   Several countries offered to assist in the rescue efforts and investigation  France offered a special rescue unit  and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti terrorist expertise to help in the investigation  President Clinton declined Israel s offer  believing that to accept it would increase anti Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim Americans   5 5  Children affected  In the wake of the bombing  the national media seized upon the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children  many in the day care center  At the time of the bombing  there were 100 day care centers in the United States in 7 900 federal buildings  McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day care center when choosing the building as a target  and if he had known      it might have given me pause to switch targets  That s a large amount of collateral damage   The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day care center before the bombing  In April 2010  Joseph Hartzler  the prosecutor at McVeigh s trial  questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not      notice that there s a child day care center there  that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office    Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed  A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon  who later died in a nearby hospital  was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack  The photo  taken by utility company employee Charles H  Porter IV  won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography  The images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who  as demonstrated by later research  showed symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder  Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community  young and old alike  These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40 000 students  One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing  The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing  This study showed that these students  although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter  had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life  contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims  who suffered from post traumatic stress disorder   Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing  Many children lost one or more parents in the blast  with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent  Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents  foster parents  and other family members  Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally  One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least 10 orphaned children   President Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage  he was  beyond angry  and wanted to  put  his  fist through the television   Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with the children regarding the bombing  President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing  saying   I don t want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing     most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this   On April 22  1995  the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 federal agency employees and their children  and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast  addressed their concerns   5 6  Media coverage  Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story  The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident  Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists  such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent   Before any evidence could be introduced to say otherwise  the media presented stories to the public that accused individuals within Middle Eastern groups  At this time in America  stereotypes that focused on the Arab race had affected many American Arabs within the United States  These stereotypes may have impacted how individuals acted after the bombing  and can explain why the media assumed that Middle Eastern groups were responsible  In the case of the Oklahoma City Bombing  Hamzi Moghrabi  chairman of the American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee  blamed the media for the attacks on Muslims and Arabs that took place just days after the bombing   As the rescue effort wound down  the media interest shifted to the investigation  arrests  and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols  and on the search for an additional suspect named  John Doe Number Two   Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect  who did not resemble Nichols  with McVeigh   6  Trials and sentencing of the conspirators  The Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  led the official investigation  known as OKBOMB  with Weldon L  Kennedy acting as Special Agent in charge  Kennedy oversaw 900 federal  state  and local law enforcement personnel including 300 FBI agents  200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department  125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard  and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety  The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F  Kennedy  OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America s history  with FBI agents conducting 28 000 interviews  amassing of evidence  and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information  Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver  Colorado  citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma  The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh  Nichols  and Fortier   6 1  Timothy McVeigh  Opening arguments in McVeigh s trial began on April 24  1997  The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler  In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh s motivations  and the evidence against him  McVeigh  he said  had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army  after reading The Turner Diaries  His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia s ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill  and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents  The prosecution called 137 witnesses  including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori  and McVeigh s sister  Jennifer McVeigh  all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh s hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it  Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date  and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck   McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones  According to law professor Douglas O  Linder  McVeigh wanted Jones to present a  necessity defense —which would argue that he was in  imminent danger  from the government  that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government  such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents   McVeigh argued that  imminent  does not mean  immediate    If a comet is hurtling toward the earth  and it s out past the orbit of Pluto  it s not an immediate threat to Earth  but it is an imminent threat   Despite McVeigh s wishes  Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution s case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt  Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy  and sought to present him as  the designated patsy   but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense  After a hearing  Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible  In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone  Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime  and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks  Jones presented 25 witnesses over a one week period  including Dr  Frederic Whitehurst  Although Whitehurst described the FBI s sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence  he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated   A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing  Although it was initially believed to be from a male  it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy  a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing  Levy s coffin had to be re opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains  The unmatched leg had been embalmed  which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg s owner  Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber  possibly John Doe #2  The prosecution disputed the claim  saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg   Numerous damaging leaks  which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys  emerged  They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press  which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial  A gag order was imposed during the trial  prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence  proceedings  or opinions regarding the trial proceedings  The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517 page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams  one of the agency s explosives experts  for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions  The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence   The jury deliberated for 23 hours  On June 2  1997  McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspiracy  Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment  McVeigh was sentenced to death  In May 2001  the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3 000 documents to McVeigh s defense counsel  The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents  On June 6  federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed  After President George W  Bush approved the execution  McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners   he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex  Terre Haute in Terre Haute  Indiana  on June 11  The execution was transmitted on closed circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death  McVeigh s execution was the first federal execution in 38 years   6 2  Terry Nichols  Nichols stood trial twice  He was first tried by the federal government in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers  After he was sentenced on June 4  1998 to life without parole  the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death penalty conviction on 161 counts of first degree murder  160 non federal agent victims and one fetus   On May 26  2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges  but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death  Presiding Judge Steven W  Taylor then determined the sentence of 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole  In March 2005  FBI investigators  acting on a tip  searched a buried crawl space in Nichols  former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested  In 2009 Nichols was being held in the ADX Florence Federal Prison   6 3  Michael Fortier  Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing  In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building  Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver s license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck  Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife  He was sentenced on May 27  1998 to twelve years in prison and fined $75 000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack  On January 20  2006  after serving ten and a half years of his sentence  including time already served  Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity   6 4  Others  No  John Doe #2  was ever identified  nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg  and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing  Although the defense teams in both McVeigh s and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved  Judge Steven W  Taylor found no credible  relevant  or legally admissible evidence  of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing  When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing  he replied   Because the truth is  I blew up the Murrah Building  and isn t it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell   On the morning of McVeigh s execution a letter was released in which he had written  For those die hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this  I turn the tables and say  Show me where I needed anyone else  Financing  Logistics  Specialized tech skills  Brainpower  Strategy      Show me where I needed a dark  mysterious  Mr  X     7  Aftermath  It has been estimated that about 387 000 people in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area  a third of the population  knew someone who was directly affected by the bombing   Within 48 hours of the attack  and with the assistance of the General Services Administration  GSA   the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city  According to Mark Potok  director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center  his organization tracked another 60 domestic smaller scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005  Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage  deaths  or other destruction  Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858 domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004  Shortly after the bombing  the FBI hired an additional 500 agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks   7 1  Legislation  In the wake of the bombing the U S  government enacted several pieces of legislation  notably the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out of state  the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20  1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing  and the victims of any other future acts of violence  the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings  In response to passing the legislation  Clinton stated that  when someone is a victim  he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process  not on the outside looking in    In the years since the bombing  scientists  security experts  and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer  and for sellers to maintain records of its sale  Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer  and as of 2009  only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers  In June 1995  Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer  In 2008  Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil  The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer  Sulf N 26  for commercial use  It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive   7 1 1  Oklahoma School Curriculum  In the decade following the bombing  there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes  Oklahoma History is a one semester course required by state law for graduation from high school  however  the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks  The state s PASS standards  Priority Academic Student Skills  did not require that a student learn about the bombing  and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl  On April 6  2010   House Bill 2750  was signed by Governor Brad Henry  requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma  U S  and world history classes   On the signing  Governor Henry said “Although the events of April 19  1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day  we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ”    “We owe it to the victims  the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19  1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation ”  7 2  Building security and construction  In the weeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks  As part of a longer term plan for United States federal building security most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent security barriers  which look more attractive and are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness  Furthermore  all new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs  FBI buildings  for instance  must be set back from traffic  The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600 million   The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard  In June 1995  the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities  also known as The Marshals Report  the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1 300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government  Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1  minimum security needs  to Level 5  maximum   The Alfred P  Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building  Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers  closed circuit television monitoring  site planning and access  hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance  glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities  and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse   The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces  improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City s new federal building  The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California s earthquake design codes   7 3  Discussion of the nature of dissent  Even many who agreed with some of McVeigh s politics viewed his act as counterproductive  with much of the criticism focused on the deaths of innocent children  critics expressed chagrin that McVeigh had not assassinated specific government leaders  McVeigh had indeed contemplated the assassinations of Attorney General Janet Reno  Lon Horiuchi  and others in preference to attacking a building  and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead  Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war  as in the case of Gore Vidal s essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh  Other journalists compared him to John Brown   McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy  In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996  the government s $3 1 million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing  and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound  McVeigh stated   Once you bloody the bully s nose  and he knows he s going to be punched again  he s not coming back around    7 4  Conspiracy theories  A variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing  Some theories allege that individuals in the government  including President Bill Clinton  knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge  Other theories focus on the local news going over confirmations of other unexploded bombs in the building  Other theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing  Additional theories claim the bombing was done by the government to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat  Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents  particularly Islamic terrorists  were involved in the bombing  Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories   8  Evacuation issues  Once the explosion took place at the Alfred P  Murrah building  chaotic response filled the surrounding streets  Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so  while others  stuck in the rubble  awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers  As reported on CNN  other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated  but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so  This traffic  along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets  delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies  Several agencies  including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing  and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort  Because of the crowded streets  and the number of response agencies sent to the location  communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled  Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting  thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process  The City of Oklahoma  in their After Action Report  declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations  Following the events of September 11  2001  with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing  the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians  These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly  By helping civilians out  and rescue workers in  the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased   9  Memorial observances  9 1  Oklahoma City National Memorial  For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys  crucifixes  letters  and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building  Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City  but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996  when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force  composed of 350 members  was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing  On July 1  1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15 member panel from 624 submissions  The memorial was designed at a cost of $29 million  which was raised by public and private funds  The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg  It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19  2000  exactly five years after the bombing  Within the first year  it had 700 000 visitors   The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates  one inscribed with the time 9 01  the other with 9 03  the pool representing the moment of the blast  On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs—one for each person lost  arranged according to what floor of the building they were on  The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims  families  The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost  On the opposite side is the  survivor tree   part of the building s original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it  The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact  allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction  Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast  which had attracted over 800 000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation  is now on the western edge of the memorial  North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building  which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum  an affiliate of the National Park Service  The building also contains the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism  a law enforcement training center   9 2  St  Joseph s Old Cathedral  On a corner adjacent to the memorial is a sculpture titled  And Jesus Wept   erected by St  Joseph s Old Cathedral  St  Joseph s  one of the first brick and mortar churches in the city  was almost completely destroyed by the blast  The statue is not part of the memorial itself   9 3  Remembrance observance  An observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing  An annual marathon draws thousands  and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing  For the tenth anniversary of the bombing  the city held 24 days of activities  including a week long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to April 24  2005  As in previous years  the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9 02 am  marking the moment the bomb went off  with the traditional 168 seconds of silence—one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast  The service also included the traditional reading of the names  read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City   Vice President Dick Cheney  former President Clinton  Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry  Frank Keating  Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing  and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that  goodness overcame evil   The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City   President George W  Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement  part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001   For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on   Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield  Illinois  to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum  Cheney attended the service in his place   10  See also  1993 World Trade Center bombing  2011 Norway attacks
