Jamaica lies south of Cuba and west of Haiti  At its greatest extent  Jamaica is long  and its width varies between   With an area of   Jamaica is the largest island of the Commonwealth Caribbean and the third largest of the Greater Antilles  after Cuba and Hispaniola  Many small islands are located along the south coast of Jamaica  such as the Port Royal Cays  Southwest of mainland Jamaica lies Pedro Bank  an area of shallow seas  with a number of cays  low islands or reefs   extending generally east to west for over   To the southeast lies Morant Bank  with the Morant Cays  from Morant Point  the easternmost point of mainland Jamaica  Alice Shoal  southwest of the main island of Jamaica  falls within the Jamaica–Colombia Joint Regime   1  Geology and landforms  Jamaica and the other islands of the Antilles evolved from an arc of ancient volcanoes that rose from the sea millions of years ago  During periods of submersion  thick layers of limestone were laid down over the old igneous and metamorphic rock  In many places  the limestone is thousands of feet thick  The country can be divided into three landform regions  the eastern mountains  the central valleys and plateaus  and the coastal plains   The highest area is the Blue Mountains  These eastern mountains are formed by a central ridge of metamorphic rock running northwest to southeast from which many long spurs jut to the north and south  For a distance of over   the crest of the ridge exceeds   The highest point is Blue Mountain Peak at   The Blue Mountains rise to these elevations from the coastal plain in the space of about   thus producing one of the steepest general gradients in the world  In this part of the country  the old metamorphic rock reveals itself through the surrounding limestone  To the north of the Blue Mountains lies the strongly tilted limestone plateau forming the John Crow Mountains  This range rises to elevations of over   To the west  in the central part of the country  are two high rolling plateaus  the Dry Harbour Mountains to the north and the Manchester Plateau to the south  Between the two  the land is rugged and here  also  the limestone layers are broken by the older rocks  Streams that rise in the region flow outward and sink soon after reaching the limestone layers   The limestone plateau covers two thirds of the country  so that karst formations dominate the island  Karst is formed by the erosion of the limestone in solution  Sinkholes  caves and caverns  disappearing streams  hummocky hills  and terra rosa  residual red  soils in the valleys are distinguishing features of a karst landscape  all these are present in Jamaica  To the west of the mountains is the rugged terrain of the Cockpit Country  one of the world s most dramatic examples of karst topography   The Cockpit Country is pockmarked with steep sided hollows  as much as deep in places  which are separated by conical hills and ridges  On the north  the main defining feature is the fault based  Escarpment   a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west  through Windsor in the centre  to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road  B10   The Barbecue Bottom Road  which runs north south  high along the side of a deep  fault based valley in the east  is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country  However  there are two old  historical trails that cross further west  the Troy Trail  and the Quick Step Trail  both of which are seldom used as of 2006 and difficult to find  In the southwest  near Quick Step  is the district known as the  Land of Look Behind   so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile runaway slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount  one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch  Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved  flat bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils  some of the most productive on the island  The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon  long and wide  Queen of Spains Valley  Nassau Valley  and Cave Valley were formed by the same process   2  Coasts  The coastline of Jamaica is one of many contrasts  The northeast shore is severely eroded by the ocean  There are many small inlets in the rugged coastline  but no coastal plain of any extent  A narrow strip of plains along the northern coast offers calm seas and white sand beaches  Behind the beaches is a flat raised plain of uplifted coral reef   The southern coast has small stretches of plains lined by black sand beaches  These are backed by cliffs of limestone where the plateaus end  In many stretches with no coastal plain  the cliffs drop straight to the sea  In the southwest  broad plains stretch inland for a number of kilometres  The Black River courses through the largest of these plains  The swamplands of the Great Morass and the Upper Morass fill much of the plains  The western coastline contains the island s finest beaches   3  Climate  Two types of climate are found in Jamaica  An upland tropical climate prevails on the windward side of the mountains  whereas a semiarid climate predominates on the leeward side  Warm trade winds from the east and northeast bring rainfall throughout the year  The rainfall is heaviest from May to October  with peaks in those two months  The average rainfall is per year  Rainfall is much greater in the mountain areas facing the north and east  however  Where the higher elevations of the John Crow Mountains and the Blue Mountains catch the rain from the moisture laden winds  rainfall exceeds per year  Since the southwestern half of the island lies in the rain shadow of the mountains  it has a semiarid climate and receives fewer than of rainfall annually   Temperatures in Jamaica are fairly constant throughout the year  averaging in the lowlands and at higher elevations  Temperatures may dip to below at the peaks of the Blue Mountains  The island receives  in addition to the northeast trade winds  refreshing onshore breezes during the day and cooling offshore breezes at night  These are known on Jamaica as the  Doctor Breeze  and the  Undertaker s Breeze   respectively   Jamaica lies in the Atlantic hurricane belt  as a result  the island sometimes experiences significant storm damage  Powerful hurricanes which have hit the island directly causing death and destruction include Hurricane Charlie in 1951 and Hurricane Gilbert in 1988  Several other powerful hurricanes have passed near to the island with damaging effects  In 1980  for example  Hurricane Allen destroyed nearly all Jamaica s banana crop  Hurricane Ivan  2004  swept past the island causing heavy damage and a number of deaths  in 2005  Hurricanes Dennis and Emily brought heavy rains to the island  A Category 4 hurricane  Hurricane Dean  caused some deaths and heavy damage to Jamaica in August 2007   The first recorded hurricane to hit Jamaica was in 1519  The island has been struck by tropical cyclones regularly  During two of the coldest periods in the last 250 years  1780s and 1810s   the frequency of hurricanes in the Jamaica region was unusually high  Another peak of activity occurred in the 1910s  the coldest decade of the 20th century  On the other hand  hurricane formation was greatly diminished from 1968 to 1994  which for some reason coincides with the great Sahel drought   4  Vegetation and wildlife  Although most of Jamaica s native vegetation has been stripped in order to make room for cultivation  some areas have been left virtually undisturbed since the time of Columbus  Indigenous vegetation can be found along the northern coast from Rio Bueno to Discovery Bay  in the highest parts of the Blue Mountains  and in the heart of the Cockpit Country   As in the case of vegetation  considerable loss of wildlife has occurred beginning with the settlement of native peoples in the region millennia ago  For example  the only pinniped ever known to the Caribbean  the Caribbean monk seal once occurred in Jamaican waters and has now been driven to extinction   5  See also  Jamaica  List of cities and towns in Jamaica  6  References
