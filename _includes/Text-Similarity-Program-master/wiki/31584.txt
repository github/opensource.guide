Lord of the Flies is a 1954 dystopian novel by Nobel Prize winning English author William Golding about a group of British boys stuck on an uninhabited island who try to govern themselves with disastrous results  Its stances on the already controversial subjects of human nature and individual welfare versus the common good earned it position 68 on the American Library Association’s list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990–1999  The novel is a reaction to the youth novel The Coral Island by R  M  Ballantyne   Published in 1954  Lord of the Flies was Golding’s first novel  Although it was not a great success at the time—selling fewer than 3 000 copies in the United States during 1955 before going out of print—it soon went on to become a best seller  It has been adapted to film twice in English  in 1963 by Peter Brook and 1990 by Harry Hook  and once in Filipino  1976    In 2005 the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best English language novels from 1923 to 2005  It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels  reaching number 41 on the editor s list  and 25 on the reader s list  In 2003  the novel was listed at number 70 on the BBC s survey The Big Read   1  Background  The book indicates that it takes place in the midst of an unspecified nuclear war  Some of the marooned characters are ordinary students  while others arrive as a musical choir under an established leader  Most  with the exception of the choirboys  appear never to have encountered one another before  The book portrays their descent into savagery  left to themselves in a paradisiacal country  far from modern civilisation  the well educated children regress to a primitive state   At an allegorical level  the central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward civilization—living by rules  peacefully and in harmony—and toward the will to power  Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality  between rational and emotional reactions  and between morality and immorality  How these play out  and how different people feel the influences of these  form a major subtext of Lord of the Flies   2  Plot  In the midst of a wartime evacuation  a British plane crashes on or near an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean  The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or preadolescence  Two boys—the fair haired Ralph and an overweight  bespectacled boy reluctantly nicknamed  Piggy —find a conch  which Ralph uses as a horn to call all the survivors to one area  Due largely to the fact that Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together  he is quickly elected their  chief   though he does not receive the votes of the members of a boys  choir  led by the red headed Jack Merridew  Ralph asserts three primary goals  to have fun  survive  and to maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island  The boys declare that whoever holds the conch shall also be able to speak at their formal gatherings and receive the attentive silence of the larger group   Jack organises his choir group into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source  Ralph  Jack  and a quiet  dreamy boy named Simon soon form a loose troika of leaders  Though he is Ralph s only confidant  Piggy is quickly made an outcast by his fellow  biguns   older boys  and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children  Simon  in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters  feels an instinctive need to protect the  littluns   younger boys    The semblance of order quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle  giving little aid in building shelters  and begin to develop paranoias about the island  referring to a supposed monster  the  beast   which they believe to exist on the island  Ralph insists that no such beast exists  but Jack  who has started a power struggle with Ralph  gains control of the discussion by boldly promising to kill the beast  At one point  Jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig  drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire  A ship travels by the island  but without the boys  smoke signal to alert the ship s crew  the ship continues by without stopping  Angered by the failure of the boys to attract potential rescuers  Ralph considers relinquishing his position  but is convinced not to do so by Piggy   One night  an aerial battle occurs over the island while the boys sleep  during which a dead fighter pilot is ejected from his plane  His body drifts down to the island in his parachute  both get tangled in a tree near the top of the mountain  Later on  while Jack schemes against Ralph  twins Sam and Eric  now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire  see the corpse of the fighter pilot and his parachute in the dark  Mistaking the corpse for the beast  they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected and warn the others  This unexpected meeting again raises tensions between Jack and Ralph  Shortly thereafter  Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island  where a mountain of stones  later called Castle Rock  forms a place where he claims the beast resides  Only Ralph and Jack s sadistic supporter Roger agree to go  Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys  When they arrive at the shelters  Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph  asking for them to remove him from his position  Receiving little support  Jack  Roger  and another boy leave the shelters to form their own tribe  This tribe lures in recruits from the main group by providing a feast of cooked pig and its members begin to paint their faces and enact bizarre rituals including sacrifices to the beast   Simon  likely an epileptic  wanders off on his own to think and finds a severed pig head  left by Jack as an offering to the beast  Simon envisions the pig head  now swarming with scavenging flies  as the  Lord of the Flies  and believes that it is talking to him  The pig s head tells Simon that the boys themselves  created  the beast and claims that the real beast is inside them all  Simon also locates the dead parachutist who had been mistaken for the beast  and is the sole member of the group to recognise that the  monster  is merely a human corpse  Simon  hoping to tell others of the discovery  finds Jack s tribe in the island s interior during a ritual dance and  mistaken for the beast  is killed by the frenzied boys  Ralph  Piggy  Sam  and Eric feel guilty that they  too  participated in this murderous  dance    Jack and his band of  savages  decide that they should possess Piggy s glasses  the only means of starting a fire on the island  so they raid Ralph s camp  confiscate the glasses  and return to their abode on Castle Rock  Ralph  now deserted by most of his supporters  journeys to Castle Rock to confront Jack and secure the glasses  Taking the conch and accompanied only by Piggy  Sam  and Eric  Ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object  Turning against Ralph  the tribe takes Sam and Eric captive while Roger drops a boulder from his vantage point above  killing Piggy and shattering the conch  Ralph manages to escape  but Sam and Eric are tortured until they agree to join Jack s tribe   The following morning  Jack orders his tribe to begin a manhunt for Ralph  Jack s savages set fire to the forest while Ralph desperately weighs his options for survival  Following a long chase  most of the island is consumed in flames  With the hunters closely behind him Ralph trips and falls  He looks up at a uniformed adult   a naval officer whose party has landed from a passing warship to investigate the fire  Ralph bursts into tears over the death of Piggy and the  end of innocence   Infected by his emotion the other children  filthy and unkempt but suddenly reverting to their true ages  also spontaneously erupt into sobs  After expressing disappointment that  British boys  had fallen into such feral behaviour  the officer awkwardly turns away to give them a moment to pull themselves together   3  Allegorical relationships  3 1  Ralph  When he and the others arrive on the island  Ralph quickly becomes the chief of the group  not by any harsh  overt  or physical action  but by being elected  Ralph is described as having  the directness of genuine leadership   Ralph s first big decision is that they have  got to decide if this is an island   After Ralph  Jack  and Simon discover that they are truly  on an uninhabited island   Ralph suggests that a fire be lit because  if a ship comes near the island they may not notice us   However  towards the end of the book he forgets the initial reason for maintaining the fire  This is representative of the debilitating effects corruption has on even the most benevolent of men  Ralph may seem to mean well  but often his obsession with being popular overcomes him and he resorts to bullying Piggy to regain his power  Therefore  Ralph can be understood to symbolize mankind s optimistic ambition to self govern despite its historical record of failure and abuse of power  Still  in the midst of all the island s chaos  it should be noted that Ralph has a tendency to be polite  selfless and logical in the tensest of moments  for example  when the children are obliged to investigate Castle Rock  Ralph takes the lead despite being afraid of  the beast   Ralph is sometimes perceived as partially being a literary tool to aid the audience s realisation of inner evil throughout the duration of the novel   Ralph wept for the end of innocence    Just as mankind has demonstrated its limitations in effective self governing  Ralph embodies good intentions in the implementation of reason  but ultimately fails to execute these plans soundly  Ralph s refusal to resort to violence throughout the novel is counterpoised by Jack s inherent love of violence  Beginning with his self nomination as hunter  Jack eventually degenerates into the beast he is consumed with slaying  Towards the end of the story  Jack abandons the tribe and forms one of his own  His darkly irresistible nature  along with the lure of meat  immediately sways the majority of the island dwellers to his tribe  which is a much more violent group  Jack s insurrection begins a chain of events that drives the island further into chaos  initially resulting in the frenzied mob murdering Simon during a primal dance  and then culminating with the murder of Piggy by Roger before the group attempts to hunt down Ralph   3 2  Piggy  Piggy has poor eyesight  asthma  and is overweight  He is the most physically vulnerable of all the boys  He appears to be of working class background  as evidenced by his non standard Cockney speech  but he is the most intellectual of the boys  frequently appealing to reason  By frequently quoting his aunt  he provides the only female voice   Piggy has been described as  the only adult type figure on the island   His intellect benefits the group only through Ralph  he acts as Ralph s adviser  He cannot be the leader himself because he lacks leadership qualities and has no rapport with the other boys  Piggy relies on the power of social convention  He believes that holding the conch gives him the right to be heard  He believes that upholding social conventions produces results   Piggy asserts that  Life     is scientific   Ever the pragmatist  Piggy complains   What good re you doing talking like that   when Ralph brings up the highly charged issue of Simon s death at their hands  Piggy tries to keep life scientific despite the incident   searching for a formula  to explain the death  He asserts that the assault on Simon was an accident  and justifiable because Simon asked for it by inexplicably crawling out of the forest into the ring   Piggy is so intent on preserving some remnant of civilization on the island that  after Jack s tribe attacks Ralph s group  he assumes they  wanted the conch   when  in fact  they have come for Piggy s glasses in order to make fire  Even up to the moment of his death  Piggy s perspective does not shift in response to the reality of their situation  Because his eminently intellectual approach to life is modelled on the attitudes and rules of the authoritative adult world  he thinks everyone should share his values and attitudes as a matter of course  When Ralph and Piggy confront Jack s tribe about the stolen spectacles  Piggy asks  Which is better—to have rules and agree  or to hunt and kill      law and rescue  or hunting and breaking things up   as if there is no doubt that the boys would choose his preference   In the 2012 film Island  the character Max is a re imagining of Piggy and is played by actor Robbie Curran   3 3  The Conch  When first blown  it calls the children to an assembly  where Ralph is elected leader  They agree that only the boy holding the conch may speak at meetings to forestall arguments and chaos  and that it should be passed around to those who wish to voice their opinion  The conch symbolises effective democracy and  like Ralph  civility and order within the group  When Piggy is killed  the conch is smashed into pieces  signalling the end of order and the onset of chaos  Originally the conch is portrayed as being very vibrant and colourful  but as the novel progresses  its colours begin to fade  the same way society begins to fade on the island   3 4  Jack Merridew  Jack epitomises the worst aspects of human nature when unrepressed or un tempered by society  Like Ralph  Jack is a natural leader  Unlike Ralph  Jack appeals to more primal desires in the children and relies on his status as leader of the choirboys to justify his authority  Although his way of behaving is neither disruptive nor violent at the beginning of the book  he does  at that time  express an unquenchable desire to hunt and kill a pig and spends hours in solitude traversing the island   This first time Jack has an opportunity to kill a pig  he cannot   because of the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh  because of the unbearable blood   After this hesitation  for which he is most ashamed  Jack s blood lust grows more and more irrational  to the point where he abandons the fire  and causes the boys to miss a potential rescue  in order to hunt  During Jack s metamorphosis  he begins to paint his face with clay and earth  masking his humanity from the pigs and inspiring terrible awe amongst the boys   Jack s transition puts him on a collision course with Ralph s elected authority  As Jack leaves and takes the majority of the boys with him  lured by the promises of meat  play  and freedom  there has arisen a clear dividing line between the two  Jack represents the irrational nature of the boys  while Ralph represents rationality  Under Jack s rule  the baseness of human nature is unleashed  and he initiates a period of inter tribal violence  punishing other children  inciting the frenzy that leads to the murder of Simon  and torturing the twins until they submit to his authority   The tale ends with Jack leading many of the boys in a frenzied attempt to kill Ralph  At this time  the last remaining vestiges of civilization are gone  and Ralph s demise is only prevented by the abrupt and unexpected arrival of a naval officer  who is disappointed by the savage nature of the British boys   3 5  Roger  Roger  at first  is a simple  bigun  who is having fun during his stay on the island  Along with Maurice  he destroys the sand castles made by three small children  While Maurice feels guilt for kicking sand into a child s eye  Roger begins to emerge as a sadist as he throws stones at one of the boys  The book states that Roger threw the stones to miss and felt the presence of civilization and society preventing him from harming the children  Later  once he feels that all aspects of conventional society are gone  he is left alone to his animal urges  During a pig hunt  Roger shoves a sharpened stick up the animal s rectum while it is still alive  He kills Piggy with a boulder that was no longer aimed to miss and becomes the executioner and torturer of Jack s tribe  He also tortured Sam and Eric into joining Jack s tribe  In the final hunt for Ralph at the end of the novel  Roger is armed with  a stick sharpened at both ends   indicating his intentions of killing Ralph and offering his head as a sacrifice to the  beast   He represents the person who enjoys hurting others and is only restrained by the rules of society   3 6  Simon  Simon is a character who represents peace and tranquillity and positivity  He is often seen wandering off by himself in a dreamy state and is prone to fits of fainting and hallucination  likely epileptic in nature  He is in tune with the island and often experiences extraordinary sensations when listening to its sounds  He loves the nature of the island  He is positive about the future  He has an extreme aversion to the pig s head  the  Lord of the Flies   which derides and taunts Simon in a hallucination  After this experience  Simon emerges from the forest to tell the others that the  beast  that fell from the sky is actually a deceased parachutist caught on the mountain  He is brutally killed by the boys  who ironically mistake him for the beast and kill him in their  dance  in which they  ripped and tore at the beast   It is implied that Ralph  Piggy  Sam  and Eric partake in the killing  The final words that the  Lord of the Flies  had said to Simon vaguely predicted that his death was about to occur in this manner  Earlier in the novel Simon himself also predicts his own death when he tells Ralph that Ralph will  get back all right   implying that  of the two of them  only Ralph will be saved  Simon s death represents the loss of truth  innocence  and common sense  Simon is most commonly interpreted as a Christ figure because of his ability to see through misconception  unlike the rest of the boys  and the events he experiences in the book that parallel those of Jesus  life   3 7  Naval Officer  Arriving moments before Ralph s seemingly impending death  the Royal Navy officer is surprised and disappointed to learn that the boys  society has collapsed into chaos  He states that he would have expected  a better show  from British children  The sudden looming appearance of an adult authority figure instantly reduces the savagery of the hunt to a brutal children s game  Upon the officer asking who is in charge  Ralph answers loudly   I am   and Jack  who was previously characterised as a powerful leader  is reduced to  A little boy who wore the remains of an extraordinary black cap on his red hair and who carried the remains of a pair of spectacles at his waist   In the last sentence  the officer  embarrassed by the distress of the children  turns to look at the cruiser from which his party has landed—a symbol of his own adult war   3 8  The Beast  The Beast represents the latent savagery within all human beings  It is first mentioned by a  littlun   and the notion is immediately dismissed by Ralph  The Beast is thought to be within the water and described by the littluns as such  Soon after the rumours of the Beast begin to flourish  the corpse of a fighter pilot  ejected from his aircraft  falls to the island  His parachute becomes entangled in the jungle foliage in such a way that sporadic gusts of wind cause the chute to billow and the body to move as if still alive  Sam and Eric discover the parachutist in the dark and believe that it is the beast  Ralph  Jack  and Roger search for the Beast and encounter it on the mountain  The reality of the Beast is now firmly established in the boys  minds  Simon discovers the parachutist and realises that the beast is really only the corpse of a man  Jack s tribe feeds the Beast with the sow s head on a stick  This act symbolises Jack s willingness to succumb to the temptation of animalism   Simon is the first child on the island to realise that the Beast is created by the boys  fear  He decides that  the news must reach the others as soon as possible   Meanwhile  the boys have been feasting and begin to do their tribal pig hunting dance  When  the beast stumble s  in to the horseshoe   the frenzied  terrified boys  leapt on to the beast  screamed  struck  bit  tore   While this is going on  the pilot s dead body finally falls out of the tree and down the mountain into the sea  It becomes clear that the boys have mistaken Simon for the beast and murdered him both when Golding describes  Simon s dead body move ing  out towards the open sea   and on the morning after when Ralph tells Piggy   That was Simon      That was murder    3 9  The Lord of the Flies  The eponymous Lord of the Flies exists physically as a pig s head that has been cut off by Jack  put on a stick sharpened at both ends  stuck in the ground  and left as an offering to the  beast   Created out of fear  the Lord of the Flies is the remnant of a mother sow who  though at one time loving and innocent  has now become a manically smiling  bleeding image of horror  It represents both an intelligent  supernatural malevolence with the power to evoke  the beast  within all  as well as the power of evil in the heart of mankind  Near the end of the book  while Ralph is being hunted down  he strikes the now skeletal pig s head twice in one moment of blind anger  causing it to crack and fall on the ground with a grin  now six feet across   The name  Lord of the Flies  is a literal translation of Beelzebub   4  Adaptations
