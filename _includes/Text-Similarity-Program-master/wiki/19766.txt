The Marshall Plan  officially the European Recovery Program  ERP  was the American initiative to aid Europe  in which the United States gave $17 billion  approximately $160 billion in current dollar value  in economic support to help rebuild European economies after the end of World War II  The plan was in operation for four years beginning in April 1948  The goals of the United States were to rebuild war devastated regions  remove trade barriers  modernize industry  and make Europe prosperous again   The Marshall Plan aid was divided amongst the participant states on a roughly per capita basis  A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers  as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival  Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the Allied nations  with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral  The largest recipient of Marshall Plan money was the United Kingdom  receiving about 26% of the total   followed by France  18%  and West Germany  11%   Some 18 European countries received Plan benefits  Although offered participation  the Soviet Union refused Plan benefits  and also blocked benefits to Eastern Bloc countries   The initiative is named after Secretary of State George Marshall  The plan had bipartisan support in Washington  where the Republicans controlled Congress and the Democrats controlled the White House with Harry S  Truman as president  The Plan was largely the creation of State Department officials  especially William L  Clayton and George F  Kennan  with help from Brookings Institution  as requested by Senator Arthur H  Vandenberg  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Marshall spoke of an urgent need to help the European recovery in his address at Harvard University in June 1947   The phrase  equivalent of the Marshall Plan  is often used to describe a proposed large scale rescue program   1  Development and deployment  The reconstruction plan  developed at a meeting of the participating European states  was drafted on June 5  1947  It offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies  but they did not accept it  as to do so would be to allow a degree of US control over the Communist economies  Secretary Marshall became convinced that Stalin had absolutely no interest in helping restore economic health in Western Europe  President Harry Truman signed the Marshall Plan on April 3  1948  granting $5 billion in aid to 16 European nations  During the four years that the plan was operational  US donated $13 billion in economic and technical assistance to help the recovery of the European countries that had joined in the Organization for European Economic Co operation  In 2013  the equivalent sum reflecting currency inflation since 1948 totalled roughly $148 billion  The $13 billion was in the context of a US GDP of $258 billion in 1948  and was on top of $13 billion in American aid to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Plan that is counted separately from the Marshall Plan  The Marshall Plan was replaced by the Mutual Security Plan at the end of 1951   The ERP addressed each of the obstacles to postwar recovery  The plan looked to the future  and did not focus on the destruction caused by the war  Much more important were efforts to modernize European industrial and business practices using high efficiency American models  reducing artificial trade barriers  and instilling a sense of hope and self reliance   By 1952  as the funding ended  the economy of every participant state had surpassed pre war levels  for all Marshall Plan recipients  output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938  Over the next two decades  Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity  but economists are not sure what proportion was due directly to the ERP  what proportion indirectly  and how much would have happened without it  A common American interpretation of the program s role in European recovery is the one expressed by Paul Hoffman  head of the Economic Cooperation Administration  in 1949  when he told Congress that Marshall aid had provided the  critical margin  on which other investment needed for European recovery depended  The Marshall Plan was one of the first elements of European integration  as it erased trade barriers and set up institutions to coordinate the economy on a continental level—that is  it stimulated the total political reconstruction of western Europe   Belgian economic historian Herman Van der Wee concludes the Marshall Plan was a  great success    2  Wartime destruction  By the end of World War II  much of Europe was devastated  Sustained aerial bombardment during the war had badly damaged most major cities  and industrial facilities were especially hard hit  The region s trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted  millions were in refugee camps living on aid from United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other agencies  Food shortages were severe  especially in the harsh winter of 1946–1947  From July 1945 Through June 1946  the United States shipped 16 5 million tons of food  primarily wheat  to Europe and Japan  It amounted to 1 6 of the American food supply  and provided 35 trillion calories  enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people   Especially damaged was transportation infrastructure  as railways  bridges  and docks had been specifically targeted by air strikes  while much merchant shipping had been sunk  Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage  the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated  None of these problems could be easily remedied  as most nations engaged in the war had exhausted their treasuries in its execution   The only major powers whose infrastructure had not been significantly harmed in World War II were the United States and Canada  They were much more prosperous than before the war but exports were a small factor in their economy  Much of the Marshall Plan aid would be used by the Europeans to buy manufactured goods and raw materials from the United States and Canada   3  Initial post war events  3 1  Slow recovery  Europe s economies were recovering slowly  as unemployment and food shortages led to strikes and unrest in several nations  In 1947 the European economies were still well below their pre war levels and were showing few signs of growth  Agricultural production was 83% of 1938 levels  industrial production was 88%  and exports only 59%  In Britain the situation was not as severe   In Germany in 1945–46 housing and food conditions were bad  as the disruption of transport  markets and finances slowed a return to normality  In the West  bombing had destroyed 5 000 000 houses and apartments  and 12 000 000 refugees from the east had crowded in  Food production was only two thirds of the pre war level in 1946–48  while normal grain and meat shipments no longer arrived from the East  Furthermore  the large shipments of food stolen from occupied nations during the war no longer reached Germany  Industrial production fell more than half and reached pre war levels only at the end of 1949   During the first three years of occupation of Germany the UK and US vigorously pursued a military disarmament program in Germany  partly by removal of equipment but mainly through an import embargo on raw materials  part of the Morgenthau Plan approved by President Franklin D  Roosevelt   Nicholas Balabkins concludes that  as long as German industrial capacity was kept idle the economic recovery of Europe was delayed   By July 1947 Washington realized that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base  deciding that an  orderly  prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany   In addition  the strength of Moscow controlled communist parties in France and Italy worried Washington   In the view of the State Department under President Harry S  Truman  the United States needed to adopt a definite position on the world scene or fear losing credibility  The emerging doctrine of containment  as opposed to rollback  argued that the United States needed to substantially aid non communist countries to stop the spread of Soviet influence  There was also some hope that the Eastern European nations would join the plan  and thus be pulled out of the emerging Soviet bloc  but that was not to happen   In January 1947  Truman appointed retired General George Marshall as Secretary of State  In July 1947 Marshall scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067 implemented as part of the Morgenthau Plan under the personal supervision of Roosevelt s treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau  Jr   which had decreed  take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany  or  designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy   Thereafter  JCS 1067 was supplanted by JCS 1779  stating that  an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany   The restrictions placed on German heavy industry production were partly ameliorated  permitted steel production levels were raised from 25% of pre war capacity to a new limit placed at 50% of pre war capacity   With a Communist insurgency threatening Greece  and Britain financially unable to continue its aid  the President announced his Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947   to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures   with an aid request for consideration and decision  concerning Greece and Turkey  Also in March 1947  former US President Herbert Hoover  in one of his reports from Germany  argued for a change in US occupation policy  amongst other things stating    There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a  pastoral state   Morgenthau s vision   It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25 000 000 people out of it   Hoover further noted that   The whole economy of Europe is interlinked with German economy through the exchange of raw materials and manufactured goods  The productivity of Europe cannot be restored without the restoration of Germany as a contributor to that productivity   Hoover s report led to a realization in Washington that a new policy was needed   almost any action would be an improvement on current policy   In Washington  the Joint Chiefs declared that the  complete revival of German industry  particularly coal mining  was now of  primary importance  to American security  The United States was already spending a great deal to help Europe recover  Over $14 billion was spent or loaned during the postwar period through the end of 1947  and is not counted as part of the Marshall Plan  Much of this aid was designed to restore infrastructure and help refugees  Britain  for example  received an emergency loan of $3 75 billion   The United Nations also launched a series of humanitarian and relief efforts almost wholly funded by the United States  These efforts had important effects  but they lacked any central organization and planning  and failed to meet many of Europe s more fundamental needs  Already in 1943  the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration  UNRRA  was founded to provide relief to areas liberated from Germany  UNRRA provided billions of dollars of rehabilitation aid  and helped about 8 million refugees  It ceased operations in the Displaced persons camp of Europe in 1947  many of its functions were transferred to several UN agencies   4  Soviet negotiations  After Marshall s appointment in January 1947  administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and others to press for an economically self sufficient Germany  including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants  goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets in their occupied zone  The Soviets took a punitive approach  pressing for a delay rather than an acceleration in economic rehabilitation  demanding unconditional fulfillment of all prior reparation claims  and pressing for progress toward nationwide socioeconomic transformation   After six weeks of negotiations  Molotov rejected all of the American and British proposals  Molotov also rejected the counter offer to scrap the British American  Bizonia  and to include the Soviet zone within the newly constructed Germany  Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin to explain that the United States could not possibly abandon its position on Germany  while Stalin expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems   5  Marshall s speech  After the adjournment of the Moscow conference following six weeks of failed discussions with the Soviets regarding a potential German reconstruction  the United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer   To clarify the US s position  a major address by Secretary of State George Marshall was planned  Marshall gave the address to the graduating class of Harvard University on June 5  1947  Standing on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard  he offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction  The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid   The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down      Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned  the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all  It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world  without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace  Our policy is not directed against any country  but against hunger  poverty  desperation and chaos  Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co operation on the part of the USA  Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist   Marshall was convinced that economic stability would provide political stability in Europe  He offered aid  but the European countries had to organize the program themselves  The speech  written by Charles Bohlen  contained virtually no details and no numbers  More a proposal than a plan  it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate  It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe  indicating the United States would then fund this plan  The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans  and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience  In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers journalists were not contacted  and on the same day Truman called a press conference to take away headlines  In contrast  Dean Acheson  an Under Secretary of State  was dispatched to contact the European media  especially the British media  and the speech was read in its entirety on the BBC   6  Rejection by the Soviets  British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin heard Marshall s radio broadcast speech and immediately contacted French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault to begin preparing a quick European response to  and acceptance of  the offer  The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power  Marshall s speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets  feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust  State Department officials  however  knew that Stalin would almost certainly not participate  and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to be approved by Congress   6 1  Initial reactions  While the Soviet ambassador in Washington suspected that the Marshall Plan could lead to the creation of an anti Soviet bloc  Stalin was open to the offer  He directed that—in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid—countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them  Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that  a  credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and  b  aid would also be extended to Germany in total  an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets  ability to exercise influence in western Germany   Initially  Stalin maneuvered to kill the Plan  or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions  He quickly realized  however  that this would be impossible after Molotov reported—following his arrival in Paris in July 1947—that conditions for the credit were non negotiable  Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid  as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude   Stalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid  potentially causing a loss of control of the Eastern Bloc  In addition  the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed—a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree  Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy  something incompatible with the strict Soviet command economy   6 2  Compulsory Eastern Bloc rejection  Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov left Paris  rejecting the plan  Thereafter  statements were made suggesting a future confrontation with the West  calling the United States both a  fascizing  power and the  center of worldwide reaction and anti Soviet activity   with all U S  aligned countries branded as enemies  The Soviets also then blamed the United States for communist losses in elections in Belgium  France and Italy months earlier  in the spring of 1947  It claimed that  marshallization  must be resisted and prevented by any means  and that French and Italian communist parties were to take maximum efforts to sabotage the implementation of the Plan  In addition  Western embassies in Moscow were isolated  with their personnel being denied contact with Soviet officials   On July 12  a larger meeting was convened in Paris  Every country of Europe was invited  with the exceptions of Spain  a World War II neutral that had sympathized with Axis powers  and the small states of Andorra  San Marino  Monaco  and Liechtenstein  The Soviet Union was invited with the understanding that it would likely refuse  The states of the future Eastern Bloc were also approached  and Czechoslovakia and Poland agreed to attend  In one of the clearest signs of Soviet control over the region  the Czechoslovakian foreign minister  Jan Masaryk  was summoned to Moscow and berated by Stalin for thinking of joining the Marshall Plan  Polish Prime minister Józef Cyrankiewicz was rewarded by Stalin for the Polish rejection of the Plan  Russia rewarded Poland with a lucrative five year trade agreement  the equivalent of 450 million 1948 dollars  $4 4 billion in 2014 dollars  in credit  200 000 tons of grain  heavy machinery  and factories   The Marshall Plan participants were not surprised when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting  The other Eastern European states immediately rejected the offer  Finland also declined in order to avoid antagonizing the Soviets  see also Finlandization   The Soviet Union s  alternative  to the Marshall plan  which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe  became known as the Molotov Plan  and later  the COMECON  In a 1947 speech to the United Nations  Soviet deputy foreign minister Andrei Vyshinsky said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations  He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states  while at the same time using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure   6 3  Szklarska Poręba meeting  In late September  the Soviet Union called a meeting of nine European Communist parties in southwest Poland  A Communist Party of the Soviet Union  CPSU  report was read at the outset to set the heavily anti Western tone  stating now that  international politics is dominated by the ruling clique of the American imperialists  which have embarked upon the  enslavement of the weakened capitalist countries of Europe   Parties were to struggle against the U S  presence in Europe by any means necessary  including sabotage  The report further claimed that  reactionary imperialist elements throughout the world  particularly in the U S A   in Britain and France  had put particular hope on Germany and Japan  primarily on Hitlerite Germany—first as a force most capable of striking a blow at the Soviet Union    Referring to the Eastern Bloc  the report stated that  the Red Army s liberating role was complemented by an upsurge of the freedom loving peoples  liberation struggle against the fascist predators and their hirelings   It argued that  the bosses of Wall Street  were  tak ing  the place of Germany  Japan and Italy   The Marshall Plan was described as  the American plan for the enslavement of Europe   It described the world now breaking down  into basically two camps—the imperialist and antidemocratic camp on the one hand  and the antiimperialist and democratic camp on the other    Although the Eastern Bloc countries except Czechoslovakia had immediately rejected Marshall Plan aid  Eastern Bloc communist parties were blamed for permitting even minor influence by non communists in their respective countries during the run up to the Marshall Plan  The meeting s chair  Andrei Zhdanov  who was in permanent radio contact with the Kremlin from whom he received instructions  also castigated communist parties in France and Italy for collaboration with those countries  domestic agendas  Zhdanov warned that if they continued to fail to maintain international contact with Moscow to consult on all matters   extremely harmful consequences for the development of the brother parties  work  would result   Italian and French communist leaders were prevented by party rules from pointing out that it was actually Stalin who had directed them not to take opposition stances in 1944  The French communist party  as others  was then to redirect its mission to  destroy capitalist economy  and that the Soviet Communist Information Bureau  Cominform  would take control of the French Communist Party s activities to oppose the Marshall Plan  When they asked Zhdanov if they should prepare for armed revolt when they returned home  he did not answer  In a follow up conversation with Stalin  he explained that an armed struggle would be impossible and that the struggle against the Marshall Plan was to be waged under the slogan of national independence   7  Negotiations  Turning the plan into reality required negotiations among the participating nations  and to get the plan through the United States Congress  Sixteen nations met in Paris to determine what form the American aid would take  and how it would be divided  The negotiations were long and complex  with each nation having its own interests  France s major concern was that Germany not be rebuilt to its previous threatening power  The Benelux countries   Belgium  Netherlands and Luxemburg   despite also suffering under the Nazis  had long been closely linked to the German economy and felt their prosperity depended on its revival  The Scandinavian nations  especially Sweden  insisted that their long standing trading relationships with the Eastern bloc nations not be disrupted and that their neutrality not be infringed   The United Kingdom insisted on special status as a longstanding belligerent during the war  concerned that if it were treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid  The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism  The Truman administration  represented by William L  Clayton  promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves  but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan s passage through Congress  A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration  and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany  However  before the Marshall Plan was in effect  France  Austria  and Italy needed immediate aid  On December 17  1947  the United States agreed to give $40 million to France  Austria  China  and Italy   Agreement was eventually reached and the Europeans sent a reconstruction plan to Washington  In the document the Europeans asked for $22 billion in aid  Truman cut this to $17 billion in the bill he put to Congress  The plan encountered sharp opposition in Congress  mostly from the portion of the Republican Party led by Robert A  Taft that advocated a more isolationist policy and was weary of massive government spending  The plan also had opponents on the left  Henry A  Wallace notably among them  Wallace saw the plan as a subsidy for American exporters and sure to polarize the world between East and West   Wallace  the former vice president and secretary of agriculture  mockingly called this the  Martial Plan   arguing that it was just another step towards war  However  opposition against the Marshall Plan was greatly reduced by the shock of the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948  Soon after  a bill granting an initial $5 billion passed Congress with strong bipartisan support  Congress would eventually allocate $12 4 billion in aid over the four years of the plan   On March 17  1948  President Harry S  Truman addressed European security and condemned the Soviet Union before a hastily convened Joint Session of Congress  Attempting to contain spreading Soviet influence in Eastern Europe  Truman asked Congress to restore a peacetime military draft and to swiftly pass the Economic Cooperation Act  the name given to the Marshall Plan  Of the Soviet Union Truman said   The situation in the world today is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties which follow a great war  It is chiefly due to the fact that one nation has not only refused to cooperate in the establishment of a just and honorable peace but—even worse—has actively sought to prevent it    Members of the Republican controlled 80th Congress  1947–1949  were skeptical   In effect  he told the Nation that we have lost the peace  that our whole war effort was in vain   noted Representative Frederick Smith of Ohio  Others thought he had not been forceful enough to contain the USSR   What  Truman  said fell short of being tough   noted Representative Eugene Cox  a Democrat from Georgia   There is no prospect of ever winning Russian cooperation   Despite its reservations  the 80th Congress implemented Truman s requests  further escalating the Cold War with the USSR   Truman signed the Economic Cooperation Act into law on April 3  1948  the Act established the Economic Cooperation Administration  ECA  to administer the program  ECA was headed by economic cooperation administrator Paul G  Hoffman  In the same year  the participating countries  Austria  Belgium  Denmark  France  West Germany  the United Kingdom  Greece  Iceland  Ireland  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden  Switzerland  Turkey  and the United States  signed an accord establishing a master financial aid coordinating agency  the Organization for European Economic Cooperation  later called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD   which was headed by Frenchman Robert Marjolin   8  Implementation  The first substantial aid went to Greece and Turkey in January 1947  which were seen as the front line of the battle against communist expansion  and were already receiving aid under the Truman Doctrine  Initially Britain had supported the anti communist factions in those countries  but due to its dire economic condition it decided to pull out and in February 1947 requested the U S  to continue its efforts  The ECA formally began operation in July 1948   The ECA s official mission statement was to give a boost to the European economy  to promote European production  to bolster European currency  and to facilitate international trade  especially with the United States  whose economic interest required Europe to become wealthy enough to import U S  goods  Another unofficial goal of ECA  and of the Marshall Plan  was the containment of growing Soviet influence in Europe  evident especially in the growing strength of communist parties in Czechoslovakia  France  and Italy   The Marshall Plan money was transferred to the governments of the European nations  The funds were jointly administered by the local governments and the ECA  Each European capital had an ECA envoy  generally a prominent American businessman  who would advise on the process  The cooperative allocation of funds was encouraged  and panels of government  business  and labor leaders were convened to examine the economy and see where aid was needed   The Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States  The European nations had all but exhausted their foreign exchange reserves during the war  and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad  At the start of the plan these imports were mainly much needed staples such as food and fuel  but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended  In the latter years  under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the Korean War  an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe  Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid 1951  $3 4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi manufactured products  $3 2 billion on food  feed  and fertilizer  $1 9 billion on machines  vehicles  and equipment  and $1 6 billion on fuel   Also established were counterpart funds  which used Marshall Plan aid to establish funds in the local currency  According to ECA rules 60% of these funds had to be invested in industry  This was prominent in Germany  where these government administered funds played a crucial role in lending money to private enterprises which would spend the money rebuilding  These funds played a central role in the reindustrialization of Germany  In 1949–50  for instance  40% of the investment in the German coal industry was by these funds   The companies were obligated to repay the loans to the government  and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses  This process has continued to this day in the guise of the state owned KfW bank   Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau  meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute   The Special Fund  then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry  was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971  In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion  Through the revolving loan system  the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion  The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt  stabilize the currency  or invest in non industrial projects  France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds  using them to reduce the budget deficit  In France  and most other countries  the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues  and not recycled as in Germany   8 1  Technical Assistance Program  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  contributed heavily to the success of the Technical Assistance Program  The United States Congress passed a law on June 7  1940 that allowed the BLS to  make continuing studies of labor productivity  and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division  The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid   By implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits  American economists  statisticians  and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement  The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries   In order to perform this analysis  the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations  First  they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work—the average output rate  Second  they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations  By performing these calculations across all industries  the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country s manufacturing and industrial production  From that  the BLS could recommend technologies  especially statistical  that each individual nation could implement  Often  these technologies came from the United States  by the time the Technical Assistance Program began  the United States used statistical technologies  more than a generation ahead of what  the Europeans  were using    The BLS used these statistical technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations  The American government sent hundreds of technical advisors to Europe in order to observe workers in the field  this on site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers  In addition  the Technical Assistance Program funded 24 000 European engineers  leaders  and industrialists to visit America and tour America s factories  mines  and manufacturing plants  This way  the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States  The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the  hands on  experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries  from there  it became clearer how to make European production more effective   Before the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect  Maurice Tobin  the United States Secretary of Labor  expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders  He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program s administrators   That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American European councils for productivity   that productivity targets  based on American productivity standards  can and should be implemented to increase productivity   that there should be a general exchange and publication of information  and  that the  technical abstract  service should be the central source of information  The effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency  While the thousands of European leaders took their work study trips to the United States  they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well  The Europeans could watch local  state  and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society  They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants  The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas   Another important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost  While $19 4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan  the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million  Only one third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States   8 2  German level of industry restrictions  Even while the Marshall Plan was being implemented  the dismantling of German industry continued  and in 1949 Konrad Adenauer wrote to the Allies requesting the end of industrial dismantling  citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories  and also the unpopularity of the policy  Support for dismantling was by this time coming predominantly from the French  and the Petersberg Agreement of November 1949 greatly reduced the levels of deindustrialization  though dismantling of minor factories continued until 1951  The first  level of industry  plan  signed by the Allies on March 29  1946  had stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1 500 listed manufacturing plants   In January 1946 the Allied Control Council set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production  The maximum allowed was set at about 5 800 000 tons of steel a year  equivalent to 25% of the pre war production level  The UK  in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located  had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year  but had to submit to the will of the U S   France and the Soviet Union  which had argued for a 3 million ton limit   Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled  Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the Great Depression  1932   Consequently  car production was set to 10% of pre war levels  and the manufacture of other commodities was reduced as well   The first  German level of industry  plan was subsequently followed by a number of new ones  the last signed in 1949  By 1950  after the virtual completion of the by then much watered down  level of industry  plans  equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in western Germany and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6 700 000 tons  Vladimir Petrov concludes that the Allies  delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the war torn continent  a reconstruction which subsequently cost the United States billions of dollars   In 1951 West Germany agreed to join the European Coal and Steel Community  ECSC  the following year  This meant that some of the economic restrictions on production capacity and on actual production that were imposed by the International Authority for the Ruhr were lifted  and that its role was taken over by the ECSC   9  Expenditures  The Marshall Plan aid was divided amongst the participant states on a roughly per capita basis  A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers  as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival  Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the Allied nations  with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral  The table below shows Marshall Plan aid by country and year  in millions of dollars  from The Marshall Plan Fifty Years Later  There is no clear consensus on exact amounts  as different scholars differ on exactly what elements of American aid during this period were part of the Marshall Plan   10  Loans and grants  The Marshall plan  just as GARIOA  consisted of aid both in the form of grants and in the form of loans  Out of the total  1 2 billion USD were loan aid   Ireland which received 146 2 million USD through the Marshall plan  received 128 2 million USD as loans  and the remaining 18 million USD as grants  By 1969 the Irish Marshal plan debt  which was still being repaid  amounted to 31 million pounds  out of a total Irish foreign debt of 50 million pounds   The UK received 385 million USD of its Marshall plan aid in the form of loans  Unconnected to the Marshall plan the UK also received direct loans from the US amounting to 4 6 billion USD  The proportion of Marshall plan loans versus Marshall plan grants was roughly 15% to 85% for both the UK and France   Germany  which up until the 1953 Debt agreement had to work on the assumption that all the Marshall plan aid was to be repaid  spent its funds very carefully  Payment for Marshall plan goods   counterpart funds   were administered by the Reconstruction Credit Institute  which used the funds for loans inside Germany  In the 1953 Debt agreement the amount of Marshall plan aid that Germany was to repay was reduced to less than 1 billion USD  This made the proportion of loans versus grants to Germany similar to that of France and the UK  The final German loan repayment was made in 1971  Since Germany chose to repay the aid debt out of the German Federal budget  leaving the German ERP fund intact  the fund was able to continue its reconstruction work  By 1996 it had accumulated a value of 23 billion Deutsche Mark   11  Effects and legacy  The Marshall Plan was originally scheduled to end in 1953  Any effort to extend it was halted by the growing cost of the Korean War and rearmament  American Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the 1950 Congressional elections  and conservative opposition to the plan was revived  Thus the plan ended in 1951  though various other forms of American aid to Europe continued afterwards   The years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history  Industrial production increased by 35%  Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre war levels  The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared  and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically  There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan  Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe  as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway  Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery  but did not initiate it  Many argue that the structural adjustments that it forced were of great importance  Economic historians J  Bradford DeLong and Barry Eichengreen call it  history s most successful structural adjustment program   One effect of the plan was that it subtly  Americanized  countries  especially Austria  who embraced United States  assistance  through popular culture  such as Hollywood movies and rock n  roll   The political effects of the Marshall Plan may have been just as important as the economic ones  Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing  reducing discontent and bringing political stability  The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced  and throughout the region communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan  The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War  At the same time  the nonparticipation of the states of Eastern Europe was one of the first clear signs that the continent was now divided   The Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration  Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe  and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration  In some ways this effort failed  as the OEEC never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation  Rather it was the separate European Coal and Steel Community  which notably excluded Britain  that would eventually grow into the European Union  However  the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the European Economic Community  The Marshall Plan  linked into the Bretton Woods system  also mandated free trade throughout the region   While some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated  it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world  After the fall of communism several proposed a  Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe  that would help revive that region  Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent  and U S  vice president Al Gore suggested a Global Marshall Plan   Marshall Plan  has become a metaphor for any very large scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem  It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector   12  Repayment  The Organization for European Economic Cooperation took the leading role in allocating funds  and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods  The American supplier was paid in dollars  which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds  The European recipient  however  was not given the goods as a gift  but had to pay for them  usually on credit  in local currency  These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special counterpart fund  This counterpart money  in turn  could be used by the government for further investment projects  5% of the counterpart money was paid to the U S  to cover the administrative costs of the ERP  The Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants that did not have to be repaid  In addition to ERP grants  the Export Import Bank  an agency of the U S  government  at the same time made long term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US  all of which were repaid   In the case of Germany there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s  but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation  This money was owed to government and private banks in the U S   France and Britain  Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the U S  Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953  the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years  and compared to the fast growing German economy were of minor impact   13  Areas without the Plan  Large parts of the world devastated by World War II did not benefit from the Marshall Plan  The only major Western European nation excluded was Francisco Franco s Spain  which did not overtly participate in World War II  After the war  it pursued a policy of self sufficiency  currency controls  and quotas  with little success  With the escalation of the Cold War  the United States reconsidered its position  and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally  encouraged by Franco s aggressive anti communist policies  Over the next decade  a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain  but less than its neighbors had received under the Marshall Plan   While the western portion of the Soviet Union had been as badly affected as any part of the world by the war  the eastern portion of the country was largely untouched and had seen a rapid industrialization during the war  The Soviets also imposed large reparations payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence  Austria  Finland  Hungary  Romania  and especially East Germany were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR  These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid   In accordance with the agreements with the USSR shipment of dismantled German industrial installations from the west began on March 31  1946  Under the terms of the agreement the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones  In view of the Soviet failure to do so  the western zones halted the shipments east  ostensibly on a temporary basis  although they were never resumed  It was later shown that the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France  Examples of material received by the USSR were equipment from the Kugel Fischer ballbearing plant at Schweinfurt  the Daimler Benz underground aircraft engine plant at Obrigheim  the Deschimag shipyards at Bremen Weser  and the Gendorf powerplant   The USSR did establish COMECON as a riposte to the Marshall Plan to deliver aid for Eastern Bloc countries  but this was complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war  The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil  in turn  they provided machinery  equipment  agricultural goods  industrial goods  and consumer goods to the Soviet Union  Economic recovery in the east was much slower than in the west  and the economies never fully recovered in the communist period  resulting in the formation of the shortage economies and a gap in wealth between East and West  Finland  which did not join the Marshall Plan and which was required to give large reparations to the USSR  saw its economy recover to pre war levels in 1947  France  which received billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan  similarly saw its average income per person return to almost pre war level by 1949  By mid 1948 industrial production in Poland  Hungary  Bulgaria  and Czechoslovakia had recovered to a level somewhat above pre war level   13 1  Aid to Asia  From the end of the war to the end of 1953  the U S  provided grants and credits amounting to $5 9 billion to Asian countries  especially China Taiwan  $1 051 billion   India  $255 million   Indonesia  $215 million   Japan  $2 44 billion   South Korea  $894 million   Pakistan  $98 million  and the Philippines  $803 million   In addition  another $282 million went to Israel and $196 million to the rest of the Middle East  All this aid was separate from the Marshall Plan   13 2  Canada  Canada  like the United States  was little damaged by the war and in 1945 was one of the world s largest economies  It operated its own aid program  In 1948  the U S  allowed ERP aid to be used in purchasing goods from Canada  Canada made over a billion dollars in sales in the first two years of operation   13 3  World total  The total of American grants and loans to the world from 1945 to 1953 came to $44 3 billion   14  Criticism  14 1  Laissez faire criticism  Initial criticism of the Marshall Plan came from a number of economists  Wilhelm Röpke  who influenced German Minister for Economy Ludwig Erhard in his economic recovery program  believed recovery would be found in eliminating central planning and restoring a market economy in Europe  especially in those countries which had adopted more fascist and corporatist economic policies  Röpke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current  failing systems  Erhard put Röpke s theory into practice and would later credit Röpke s influence for West Germany s preeminent success   Henry Hazlitt criticized the Marshall Plan in his 1947 book Will Dollars Save the World   arguing that economic recovery comes through savings  capital accumulation and private enterprise  and not through large cash subsidies  Ludwig von Mises criticized the Marshall Plan in 1951  believing that  the American subsidies make it possible for  Europe s  governments to conceal partially the disastrous effects of the various socialist measures they have adopted   Some critics and Congressmen at the time believed that America was giving too much aid to Europe  America had already given Europe $9 billion in other forms of help in previous years  The Marshall Plan gave another $13 billion  equivalent to about $100 billion in 2010 value  Critics did not think that it was necessary for Americans to be using so much money to help nations they had already assisted in many ways before   14 2  Modern criticism  Criticism of the Marshall Plan became prominent among historians of the revisionist school  such as Walter LaFeber  during the 1960s and 1970s  They argued that the plan was American economic imperialism  and that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe  In a review of West Germany s economy from 1945 to 1951  German analyst Werner Abelshauser concluded that  foreign aid was not crucial in starting the recovery or in keeping it going   The economic recoveries of France  Italy  and Belgium  Cowen found  also predated the flow of U S  aid  Belgium  the country that relied earliest and most heavily on free market economic policies after its liberation in 1944  experienced the fastest recovery and avoided the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe   Former US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Alan Greenspan gives most credit to Ludwig Erhard for Europe s economic recovery  Greenspan writes in his memoir The Age of Turbulence that Erhard s economic policies were the most important aspect of postwar Western Europe recovery  far outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan  He states that it was Erhard s reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany s miraculous recovery  and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries  Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli  such as increases in investment  fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes  Japan saw a large infusion of US investment during the Korean War   Criticism of the Marshall Plan also aims at showing that it began a legacy of disastrous foreign aid programs  Since the 1990s  economic scholarship has been more hostile to the idea of foreign aid  For example  Alberto Alesina and Beatrice Weder  summing up economic literature on foreign aid and corruption  find that aid is primarily used wastefully and self servingly by government officials  and ends up increasing governmental corruption  This policy of promoting corrupt government is then attributed back to the initial impetus of the Marshall Plan   Noam Chomsky wrote that the amount of American dollars given to France and the Netherlands equaled the funds these countries used to finance their military actions against their colonial subjects in East Asia  in French Indochina and the Netherlands East Indies respectively  The Marshall Plan was said to have  set the stage for large amounts of private U S  investment in Europe  establishing the basis for modern transnational corporations   The Netherlands received U S  aid for economic recovery in the Netherlands Indies  However  in January 1949  the American government suspended this aid in response to the Dutch efforts to restore colonial rule in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution  and it implicitly threatened to suspend Marshall aid to the Netherlands if the Dutch government continued to oppose the independence of Indonesia   15  In popular culture  Alfred Friendly  press aide to the US Secretary of Commerce W  Averell Harriman  wrote a humorous operetta about the Marshall Plan during its first year  one of the lines in the operetta was   Wines for Sale  will you swap   A little bit of steel for Chateau Neuf du Pape    The Spanish comedy film Welcome Mr  Marshall  tells the story of a small Spanish town  Villar del Río  which hears of the visit of American diplomats and begins preparations to impress the American visitors in the hopes of benefitting under the Marshall Plan   16  See also  Dollar imperialism  German reparations for
