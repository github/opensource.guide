The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation  It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair s ZX80 and was designed to be a low cost introduction to home computing for the general public  It was hugely successful and more than 1 5 million units were sold before it was eventually discontinued  The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries  notably the United States  where it was initially sold as the ZX 81  Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales  Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market – the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500  Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in a number of countries   The ZX81 was designed to be small  simple  and above all cheap  using as few components as possible to keep the cost down  Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor  Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes  It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1 kB of memory  The machine had no power switch or any moving parts  with the exception of a channel selector switch present only on early  ZX81 USA  models which pre dated the Timex Sinclair 1000  and used a pressure sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input  The ZX81 s limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third party peripherals to improve its capabilities  Such limitations  however  achieved Sinclair s objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible  Its distinctive design brought its designer  Rick Dickinson  a Design Council award   The ZX81 could be bought by mail order in kit form or pre assembled  In what was then a major innovation  it was the first cheap mass market home computer that could be bought from high street stores  led by W H  Smith and soon many other retailers  The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public  rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists  It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts  some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81  Many went on to play a major role in the British computer industry in later years  The ZX81 s commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain s leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company s founder  Sir Clive Sinclair   1  Features  The ZX81 came with 1 kB of on board memory that could officially be expanded externally to 16 kB  Its single circuit board was housed inside a wedge shaped plastic case measuring deep by high  The memory was provided by either a single 4118  1024 bit × 8  or two 2114  1024 bit × 4  RAM chips  There were only three other chips on board  a 3 5 MHz Z80A 8 bit microprocessor from NEC  an uncommitted logic array  ULA  chip from Ferranti and an 8 kB ROM providing a simple BASIC interpreter  The entire machine weighed just   Early versions of the external RAM cartridge contained 15 kB of memory using an assortment of memory chips  while later versions contained 16 kB of chips but the lowest addressed kilobyte was disabled   The front part of the case is occupied by an integrated 40 key membrane keyboard displaying 20 graphic and 54 inverse video characters  Each key has up to five functions  accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context  For example  the P key combined the letter  P   the   character and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB  The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout  with some extra keys that are unfamiliar to modern eyes  such as a RUBOUT key  instead of DELETE  and a NEW LINE key rather than RETURN or ENTER  The keyboard is mechanically very simple  consisting of 40 pressure pad switches and eight diodes under a plastic overlay  connected in a matrix of eight rows and five columns   The ZX81 s primary input output is delivered via four sockets on the left side of the case  The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built in RF modulator  It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each  and by using the selection of 2x2 block character graphics from the machine s character set offered an effective 64 × 48 pixel graphics mode  also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands  Two 3 5 mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR  output  and MIC  input  sockets of an audio cassette recorder  enabling data to be saved or loaded at a rate of 50 baud  This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine  which has no built in storage capabilities  The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC  delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply   The ULA chip  described by the ZX81 manual as the  dogsbody  of the system  has a number of key functions that competing computers shared between multiple chips and integrated circuits  These comprise   Synchronising the screen display   Generating a 6 5 MHz clock  from which a 3 25 MHz clock is derived for the processor   Outputting an audio signal to a cassette recorder in SAVE mode   Processing the incoming cassette audio signal in LOAD mode   Sensing keystrokes   Using memory addresses provided by the CPU to decide when ROM and RAM should be active   Controlling general system timing  The ZX81 s built in RF modulator can output a video picture to either a UHF 625 line colour or monochrome television  used in the UK  Australia  and most western European countries   France required a slightly modified version of the machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525 line VHF  NTSC  television systems  Both the ZX81 and its predecessor  the ZX80  have a significant drawback in the way that they handle visual output  Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display  On the ZX80  this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place   The ZX81 s designers adopted an improved approach  involving the use of two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively  In SLOW mode  also called  compute and display  mode  the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display  It runs the current program for only about a quarter of the time – in effect slowing the machine down fourfold  although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done  In FAST mode processing occurs continuously but the display is abandoned to its own devices – equivalent to the ZX80 s standard operating mode   Another hardware quirk produced one of the most distinctive aspects of the ZX81 s screen display – during loading or saving  moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen  The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal as well as the tape output  producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts  The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations  as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers  The interference produces the zigzag stripes   The unexpanded ZX81 s tiny memory presented a major challenge to programmers  Simply displaying a full screen takes up to 793 bytes  the system variables take up another 125 bytes and the program  input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that  Nonetheless  ingenious programmers were able to achieve a surprising amount with just 1 kB  One notable example was 1K ZX Chess by David Horne  which actually managed to squeeze most of the rules of chess into only 672 bytes  The ZX81 conserved its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one byte tokens  stored as individual  characters  in the upper reaches of the machine s unique  non ASCII  character set   The edge connector or external interface at the rear of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board  This provides a set of address  control  and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices  Enthusiasts and a variety of third party companies made use of this facility to create a wide range of add ons for the ZX81   1 1  Comparisons between ZX81 and other computing devices  The following table provides a comparison between the capabilities of the ZX81 and various other competing microcomputers that were already on the market at the time of the ZX81 s launch  The prices given are as of December 1982   2  History  2 1  Background  Clive Sinclair s first company Sinclair Radionics  established in 1962  made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market  Its products included amplifiers  radios  multimeters and other items generally sold in kit form to hi fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists  The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first  slimline  pocket calculator  the Sinclair Executive  It was a major success that Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators  The company s subsequent expansion made it Europe s biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975   By the late 1970s  however  Sinclair Radionics was in serious difficulties  It lost its ability to compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a new generation of Japanese produced calculators with liquid crystal displays  which were much more capable and power efficient than Sinclair s LED calculators  Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive flops  The company made losses of over £350 000 in 1975–76  bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy  In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency  the National Enterprise Board  NEB   which recapitalised it  provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake   Clive Sinclair s relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go  Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business  which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable  Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view  that there was no future in consumer electronics   This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July 1979   While he was struggling with the NEB  Clive Sinclair turned to a  corporate lifeboat  in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control – a company called Ablesdeal Ltd  which he had established in 1973 and later renamed Science of Cambridge  It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects  free of the interference of the NEB  Despite his later success in the field  Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end  As he told the Sunday Times in April 1985   We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business   specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV80 pocket television and C5 electric vehicle  In an interview with Practical Computing  Sinclair explained   2 2  Precursors  the MK14 and ZX80  By the late 1970s  American companies such as Apple were producing simple home computer kits  This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices reduced the appeal of the American products  Off the shelf personal computers were also available for the high end of the market but were extremely expensive  Olivetti s offering cost £2 000  and the Commodore PET  launched in 1979  sold for £700  There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market  Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity   Sinclair s first home computer was the MK14  which was launched in kit form in June 1978  It was a long way from being a mass market product  Its very name – MK standing for  Microcomputer Kit  – was indicative of its origins as a product developed by  and for  hobbyists  It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display  though Science of Cambridge did produce an add on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV   it had no case  consisting of an exposed circuit board  it had no built in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory  and input was via a 20 key hexadecimal keyboard  Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10–15 000 units  by comparison  the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9 000 units in the United States  a much bigger market  in 1978  This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low cost computers that could profitably be exploited   Sinclair followed up the MK14 by producing the ZX80  at the time the world s smallest and cheapest computer  which was launched in January 1980 costing £99 95  equivalent to £319 at 2009 prices   The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80  according to Clive Sinclair  he  simply had a hunch  that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100 000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume   The ZX80 s design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX81  as Sinclair himself later said   the ZX80 was very much a stepping stone to the ZX81   The design was driven entirely by the desired price – the machine had to cost less than £100 but still make a healthy profit  Its distinctive wedge shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson  a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair  As he later recalled of Sinclair s approach   Everything was cost driven  The design was the face of the machine   The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair s cost cutting  It made use of a sheet of plastic  on which the keys were printed  overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed  This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter style keyboard  though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and  feel    Inside the case  there were many more similarities with the ZX81  Like its successor  it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1 kB of on board RAM  It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display  It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage  The main difference between the two machines lay in the internal software  when the ZX81 was released  ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board   The ZX80 was an immediate success  selling 20 000 units over the following nine months  Science of Cambridge was producing ZX80s at the rate of 9 000 a month by the end of 1980 and within 18 months of its launch the company had sold 100 000 units  The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow up product inevitable  The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980  reflecting its new focus  and became Sinclair Research in March 1981   2 3  The BBC Micro affair  The launch of the ZX81 was catalysed in part by the British Broadcasting Corporation s plan to produce a TV series  to be broadcast in 1982  aimed at popularising computing and programming  The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC branded home computer to tie in with the series  When Sinclair got wind of the project in December 1980  he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX80  to be called the ZX81  in the spring of 1981  It would remedy some of the ZX80 s deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced  Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption  He pointed out that there were already 40 000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100 000 ZX81 users  which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400 000 – an indication of how the ZX81 s success exceeded even Sinclair s expectations    A prototype ZX81 was demonstrated to BBC representatives in January 1981  while Sinclair s local rival Acorn Computers put forward their proposed Proton computer  a design – of which a prototype did not yet exist – based on the Acorn Atom  To Sinclair s dismay  the contract to produce the BBC Microcomputer went to Acorn  which launched the machine in January 1982  Paul Kriwaczek  the producer of The Computer Programme  explained his reservations in a March 1982 interview with Your Computer   Sinclair was bitterly critical of the BBC s decision  accusing it of incompetence and arrogance  Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers that schools could purchase  with the aid of a grant  for half price  Sinclair s computers were not included on the list  Sinclair responded by launching his own half price deal  offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 kB RAM pack for £60  plus a ZX Printer at half price  for a total cost of £90  As the cheapest Government approved system was £130  this was an attractive offer for many schools and about 2 300 bought Sinclair s package   2 4  Development and manufacture  The development of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched  Sinclair s chief engineer  Jim Westwood  was given the task of improving the ZX80 s hardware to reduce the number of components and thus bring down the cost  He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80  Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80 s chips into a single uncommitted logic array  ULA   a type of general purpose chip that allowed manufacturers to reprogram it to meet their particular requirements rather than having to develop their own customised chip at greater expense  Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair  who hailed Westwood s design as a triumph of innovation   The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect  the TRS 80  had 44   Only 70% of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used  but Sinclair decided to obtain maximum benefit by using them all  This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage  Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case   The ZX81 s ROM was doubled to 8 kB  from the ZX80 s 4 kB ROM  This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC  termed Sinclair BASIC by the company   Clive Sinclair re commissioned a company called Nine Tiles  which had produced the ZX80 ROM  to develop the new ROM software for the ZX81  The code was written by John Grant  the owner of Nine Tiles  and Steve Vickers  who had joined the company in January 1980  Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX81 s hardware  while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual  Sinclair s brief to the pair was fairly non specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX80 so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations  Vickers later recalled   The new ROM incorporated trigonometric and floating point functions  which its predecessor had lacked – the ZX80 could only deal with whole numbers  Grant came up with one of the ZX81 s more novel features  a syntax checker that indicated errors in BASIC code as soon as it was entered  rather than  as was standard at the time  only disclosing coding errors when a program was run   Unfortunately for Vickers  he introduced a briefly notorious error – the so called  square root bug  that caused the square root of 0 25 to be returned erroneously as 1 3591409 – as a result of problems with integrating the ZX Printer code into the ROM  Although it was eventually fixed  the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers  On a more positive note  Vickers  work on the manual was received favourably  being described in 1983 as  one of the classic texts on BASIC   Max Phillips commented in a What Micro  retrospective   The task of designing the ZX81 s case again fell to Rick Dickinson  who produced an updated version of the ZX80 s wedge shaped case  This time round  the design team were able to use injection moulding  which enabled them to deliver a higher quality case  Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as  an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width   though this approach was eventually dropped  From start to finish  the design process took about six months   The ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions  though with identical components  – a pre assembled machine or a cheaper kit version  which the user could assemble himself  Both versions were manufactured in Dundee  Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company s Dryburgh factory  Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor  as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics  It was a well established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s  Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches  Recognising the trend  Timex s director  Fred Olsen  determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business   This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair  The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair s existing manufacturer  a small electronics company in St Ives  lacked the resources to deal with the demand  Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980  The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81  aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant  Sinclair initially planned to produce 10 000 ZX81s a month  rising to 30 000 a month within a year  However  Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand  As a consequence  it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order  It was not until September 1981  five months after the launch of the ZX81  that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty eight days  Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not left out in the cold  Anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81 s launch would receive the newer machine  while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board   The reliability of the ZX81 was a somewhat controversial issue  W H  Smith  one of the machine s key distributors  had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale  so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines  Similar problems were reported in the US market  where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked  However  figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2 4 per cent of pre assembled machines were returned  although 13 per cent of kits were returned  Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability   The higher failure rate of the kits was put down to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way  though Sinclair admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre assembled ZX81s  The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair s after sales service  or rather the lack thereof  which Robin Clarke of New Scientist described as  one of the worst after sales performance records of any company ever established   The Financial Times observed that  Clive Sinclair s offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired   The company s slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained an unenviable reputation for poor customer service   2 5  Marketing  The marketing of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair s long standing marketing agency Primary Contact  now part of Ogilvy & Mather   which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was to continue doing so until 1985  Sinclair s entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge – how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the  man on the street   who probably had little or no computer literacy  The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O Reilly of MicroScope magazine described as a single minded  user friendly strategy   Chris Fawkes  one of Primary Contact s directors  explained   We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn t have to be a whizzkid to use one   As Clive Sinclair put it in a 1982 interview with Your Computer   According to the US market analyst Ben Rosen  by pricing the ZX81 so low   Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer   Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale   It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer  He does  and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly   A New Scientist retrospective published in 1986 commented   High profile advertising was central to the marketing campaign  Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company  it had a long standing policy of using large scale advertisements that stood out in stark contrast to the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers  Superlatives  exhortations  appeals to patriotism  testimonials  eye catching drawings and photographs on double page spreads  varying from month to month  were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair  The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach  A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double page spread  The value for money of Sinclair s products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread  The ZX81 s benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan  Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you   The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming  the manual written by Steve Vickers  as  a complete course in BASIC programming  from first principles to complex programs   The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed   it s still very simple to teach yourself computing   and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non technical terms  For instance  the ZX81 s idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory saving method of using one byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as  eliminat ing  a great deal of tiresome typing   The ZX81 s British character was emphasised  it was  designed by Sinclair and custom built in Britain   Sinclair s advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81 s purpose   This approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair s reliance on mail order marketing  It came with a high up front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre paid  A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign  though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand  The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over the counter sales by  getting the story across   as Clive Sinclair put it   Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order  but they see the ads  and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops    Sinclair himself became a focal point for the marketing campaign  putting a human face on the business  while Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a plucky British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations  As David O Reilly noted   by astute use of public relations  particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world  Sinclair has become the best known name in micros   The popular press soon latched onto the image  His  Uncle Clive  persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for Personal Computer World  while the media praised Sinclair as a visionary genius  or even  in the words of The Sun   the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo    As Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy put it  Sinclair outgrew  the role of microcomputer manufacturer and accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia    Pricing was central to the marketing strategy  as it had been through Sinclair s career  The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69 95  built  or £49 95  kit   One Sinclair brochure presented a side by side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom  Apple II Plus  Commodore PET and TRS 80  The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost  from £630 in the case of the Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81  though even by Sinclair s own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine   According to Sinclair himself  the £69 95 price was chosen after applying the  experience curve  developed by the Boston Consulting Group  Sinclair s prior experience in the calculator market had highlighted the fact that a product will be more profitable selling at  for instance  twice the manufactured cost than at three times  He could have launched the ZX81 at a higher price  marketing it in a more traditional way as a premium product  but chose not to  In effect  he used the lower price to establish an unassailable lead before the competition moved in   An essential part of Sinclair s marketing strategy was to use regular cost cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share  Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy comment that Sinclair s approach was  to secure and extend  his  market lead and panic the competition  While most companies reduce prices when their products are in steep decline  Sinclair tends to discount shortly after sales have peaked  The advantage of his approach is that vacillating customers are drawn into the fold while the product s promotion retains a commercial urgency  and the costings of the competition are thrown into utter disarray    This tactic proved highly successful  with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it had sold 250 000 ZX81s worldwide  When sales fell in the wake of the launch of its successor  the ZX Spectrum  Sinclair reduced the price of the pre assembled version to £49 95 in May 1982  It was cut by another £10 the following April  Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers  the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30 000 units a month even as late as July 1983  more than two years after it had been launched  By that time  according to Sinclair Research  over 1 5 million ZX81s had been sold   2 6  Distribution  The ZX81 s distribution arrangements were an essential part of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK  Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores  Fortunately for Sinclair  an opportunity to do just that was provided by W H  Smith  a venerable book  and magazine seller and stationery chain  The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range   Smith s had begun selling audio and photographic equipment and calculators at the end of the 1970s  with a modest degree of success  In 1980 its marketing development manager  John Rowland  hit upon the idea of creating  Computer Know How  sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines  Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer  The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland s interest  he approached Sinclair  saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith s on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch  As Rowland put it   what we ve done now is bring the computer orientated publications together with an actual computer  to create the Computer Know How section of the store   alongside computer software and blank cassette tapes  The ZX81 would be sold in 112 stores around the UK and would serve as the centrepiece of the  Computer Know How  sections   Selling the ZX81 over the counter was seen as something of a gamble and Rowland s colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme  Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 10–15 units per branch at launch  Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10 000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement  equivalent to one month s mail order sales by Sinclair  In the event  the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith s  it went on sale for £99 making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under £100  The  Computer Know How  sections were swamped with eager customers  overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines  a Financial Times correspondent wrote of being  dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W H  Smith   Within a year  Smith s had sold 350 000 ZX81s  making an estimated net profit of £10 million  Sales of peripherals  software  books and magazines netted even more profit   The British chain stores Boots  John Menzies and Currys began selling the ZX81 as soon as Smith s exclusive distribution deal expired and a number of companies secured overseas distribution rights for the ZX81  which was being sold in 18 countries by March 1982  Sinclair launched the ZX81 in the United States in November 1981 at a price of $149 95 assembled and $99 95 in kit form  initially selling directly to the American market by mail order  Sales reached 15 000 a month by January 1982  while American Express sold thousands more to its own customers  In February 1982 Timex obtained a licence from Sinclair to sell the ZX81 directly through thousands of retail outlets in the US  paying Sinclair Research a 5 per cent royalty on all Sinclair hardware and software sold by Timex  The company was later to produce its own licensed clones and variants of the ZX81  By August 1982 Sinclair had lowered the American mail order price of the assembled ZX81 to $99 95 and kit to $79 95  and its advertisements stated that  more than 10 000 are sold every week   In December 1981 Mitsui obtained rights to distribute the ZX81 in Japan  selling it by mail order for ¥38 700  equivalent to £83 in 1982 prices   and had sold 5 000 units by July 1982  The Japanese market s favourable reaction to the ZX81 led Mitsui to begin selling the ZX81 over the counter in large bookshops from September 1982  with annual sales of 20 000 units predicted  In the Netherlands  the regular Sinclair ZX81 was for sale as well as a Bang & Olufsen branded version called Beocomp   The ZX81 was also sold for a while in duty free shops at UK airports  However  this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods  It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states  industries  In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports  There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou  where they would be assembled for the Chinese market   3  Reception  Reviews of the ZX81 highlighted the great value for money offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings  As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer   the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment   He applauded the improvements that had been made over the ZX80  such as a much better manual  display and string handling  and called the ZX81  a very good first computer  that  will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost   However  the built in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was  mandatory for any worthwhile use   He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable  having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly   New Scientist s Malcolm Peltu commented that it was  great technical value for money particularly for computing enthusiasts  but thought that others were  likely to be bored very quickly by the basic system   He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair s accompanying software  criticising them for  a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should  and questioned whether it might be more worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore s offerings  Overall  he concluded  the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing  but  the Sinclair systems have a long way to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer based information systems among computer unbelievers    While the editor of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981  his colleagues publicised the magazine s review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a chimpanzee with the machine above the strapline  Editor benchtests the ZX81    The chimp returned in later issues to  benchtest  all of Sinclair s subsequent computers   The review  which was actually written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt  acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented  absolutely amazing value for money   He described the ZX81 as  a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers  but without it costing them an arm and a leg  and concluded   If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them  then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that  Children will love the ZX81  there can be no question about that  and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one  just to have a bit of fun    Paul Taylor of the Financial Times found the ZX81 to be  a powerful and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun introduction to the mysteries of home computing  but cautioned readers about its limitations  It lacked ready made software  the keyboard was not easy to use  it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade style games and its built in memory was inadequate  Even so  he suggested   the ZX81 is a unique British product  part toy  part puzzle  part learning tool and I think that  provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do  it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing    The Age described the ZX81 as  not extremely sophisticated  and its memory capability is rather limited  It also has a rather toy like appearance   It concluded that the computer was  an ideal toy for youngsters who want to become acquainted with the computer world  It is responsive  cheap  and very easy to use    Billy Garrett of BYTE  who already owned a ZX80  complimented the Timex Sinclair 1000 s manual  although he regretted the removal of the British original s humour   the  state of the art circuitry   and the BASIC for being  remarkably powerful  despite the small ROM size  He concluded that  the major use     will probably be for learning about BASIC or computers in general   It  has limited expansion capabilities  and the keyboard is too small and cramped for any serious work    David Babsky described the ZX81 as  a wonderfully brainy little micro which won t let you waste your time and make a fool of yourself   In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in Which Micro   he commended the ZX81 s user friendliness and its on the fly syntax checking of BASIC programs  which he described as  the feature that I  as a newcomer to computing  want to see incorporated into every micro    4  Peripherals and software  The success of the ZX81 led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software  Clive Sinclair was  amused and gratified  by the attention the machine received but made little effort to exploit the demand  effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers  a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings  W H  Smith  for instance  was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX81  owners found that technically obsolete low fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher quality music systems  Smith s purchased cheap  shoebox  cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W H  Smiths logo as  data recorders   Over 100 000 were sold in 18 months   Other than what one writer described as  a few remarkably poor programs on cassette  Sinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX81  a 16 kB RAM pack  actually the same one previously released for the ZX80  but rebadged  and the ZX Printer  both of which plugged into the edge connector at the rear of the ZX81  They retailed at a launch price of £49 95 each but both had notable flaws  The RAM pack was top heavy and was supported only by the edge connector  It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81  losing anything that the user had typed in  Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum  double sided tape or Blu Tack to cure what became known as the  RAM pack wobble  problem  The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium coated paper to reveal the black underlay  It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time   Many non Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX81 s flaws and provide many new capabilities  These included RAM packs providing up to 64 kB of extra memory and promising to  fit snugly     giving a firm connection  to the computer  typewriter style keyboards  more advanced printers and sound generators  and even a hard disk interface  which Clive Sinclair thought was  quite overgilding the lily   A wide range of software was also published  Within only a year of the ZX81 s launch  around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair compatible hardware  The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were  as the Financial Times noted   school teachers  civil servants  electrical engineers and technicians  who  have set up small operations in their own time    The ZX81 s popularity was publicly demonstrated in January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a  ZX Microfair  at Westminster Central Hall  Seventy exhibitors set up their stalls with only a few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people  More than 12 000 people turned up and the police had to be called to control the crowd  Thousands of people  many of whom had travelled long distances to get there  queued outside for up to three hours to get into the hall  an attendee wrote that  no one knows how many gave up in despair   The exhibitors found themselves selling thousands of pounds  worth of software and hardware   as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes   according to the attendee  By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held   Thousands of ZX81 programs were published  either as printed listings that could be typed in or as ready made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape  Many computer magazines featured ZX81 program listings – some  such as Sinclair Programs  were dedicated entirely to listings – while many individuals became the archetypal  bedroom programmers   producing games and applications which they produced  marketed  recorded and sold from their own homes  Some went on to found their own software houses  employing teams of programmers – some of whom were still at school – to produce programs for the ZX81 and other computers  Existing companies jumped on the bandwagon as well  to profitable effect  Psion produced a series of ZX81 programs in close association with Sinclair  including a flight simulator  while ICL s range of ZX81 programs sold over 100 000 cassettes in less than three months  Psion s success with the ZX81 had a profound effect on the future of the company  Its work on the ZX81 database program Vu File led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants  which resulted in the launch in 1984 of the Psion Organiser  the world s first handheld personal computer  Some of the most popular ZX81 games  Psion s Flight Simulation being an example  were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine s colour and sound capabilities   Enterprising programmers were able to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text characters and the machine s limited text semigraphics  Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame  such as 3D Monster Maze  a tense first person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit  Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code  its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark in the history of computer and video games   One of the more bizarre software products for the ZX81 came about as a result of music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair s computers  In 1983  EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B side  Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley  packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum   5  Clones and variants  Sinclair s licensing agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market  These were the Timex Sinclair 1000  Timex Sinclair 1500  both variants of the ZX81  and the Timex Sinclair 2068  a variant of the ZX Spectrum   The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest  at one point  the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5 000 calls an hour  50 000 a week  inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general  It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re branding and the addition of an extra 1 kB of memory  making for a grand total of 2 kB  In the five months following the TS1000 s launch  the company sold 550 000 machines  earning Sinclair over $1 2 million in royalties   Timex produced a second version of the ZX81 in the form of the TS1500  essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983  It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum  incorporating 16 kB of on board memory  It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum  However  it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after effects of Timex s botched marketing of the TS1000  Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success  Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000  Consumers would take the machine home  plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory   In addition  consumers  attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK  Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June 1981 that  our competitors thought that consumers didn t want to learn programming  We  Sinclair Research  think they failed because of this and because of price   Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption  The TS1000 ZX81 s price advantage was erased when its main rivals – the Texas Instruments TI99 4A and the Commodore VIC 20 – had their prices cut to below the all important $100 mark  Competitors such as Apple  Atari  Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education  highlighting the value of computers with ready made applications and more advanced features such as graphics  colour and sound   By late 1983 Wayne Green reported a  rising chorus of frustrated Timex users who are telling friends not to waste their money    Hard core  early adopters  he wrote   became discouraged with the quality of the product  with the poverty of software available and with the almost total lack of information on how to cope with it   Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and  as publishers of programming guides found to their cost  the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming  American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines  Burned by this experience  many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether   Some companies outside the US and UK produced their own  pirate  versions of the ZX81 and Timex Sinclair computers  aided by weak intellectual property laws in their countries of origin  Several Brazilian companies produced ZX81 clones  notably the TK series  such as the TK85  from Microdigital Eletronica of Brazil  and Prológica s CP 200  Czerweny Eletronica of Argentina produced the CZ1000 and CZ1500  clones of the ZX81 and TS1500 respectively  Lambda Electronics of Hong Kong produced the Lambda 3000  based on the ZX81  which was itself widely copied by other Chinese manufacturers   The machines were not all straight copies of the ZX81  some  such as the CP 200  came with extra memory and a larger case  often with a chiclet keyboard in place of the original membrane keyboard   One clone  the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy  could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper   6  Impact and legacy  The ZX81 had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself  The company s profitability rose enormously  from a pretax profit of £818 000 on a turnover of £4 6 million in 1980–81 to £8 55 million on a turnover of £27 17 million in 1981–82  Clive Sinclair became one of the UK s highest profile businessmen and a millionaire  receiving a £1 million bonus on top of a salary of £13 000  He received a knighthood in the Queen s Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983   The machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom  According to Clive Sinclair  purchasers of the ZX81 came from  a reasonably broad spectrum  that ranged from readers of the upmarket Observer and Sunday Times newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous Sun readers  The largest age group was around 30 years old  The Financial Times reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes  both for adults and children  though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly  Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX81 was  subtly different from the run of the mill social fad   although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties  many were older users – often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children  However  the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male dominated   One of the ZX81 s key legacies was that it spurred large numbers of people to try programming for the first time  The ZX81 plays a significant part in the plot of William Gibson s 2003 novel Pattern Recognition  One character  an artist using old ZX81s as a sculptural medium  explains the cultural and intellectual impact that the machine had on British society   Among those whose first experience of home computing was provided by the ZX81 are Terry Pratchett  who used it for  very primitive word processing    Edward de Bono and – perhaps proving William Gibson s point – many video game developers including Charles Cecil  Raffaele Cecco  Pete Cooke  David Perry  whose first published game  a driving game  involved  a black blob avoiding other black blobs    Rhianna Pratchett  and Jon Ritman   Even 30 years after launch  the ZX81 has a German user forum  and in English   New hardware and software continues to be developed for the ZX81  including   a ZX81 based webserver   the ZXpand  a combined SD card interface  32K configurable memory expansion  and optional joystick port and AY sound interface   New games on cassette tape by Revival Studios  such as Avalanche  Mayhem  Down  Stairrunner and more   7  References  8  Bibliography  8 1  Books  8 2  News reports  8 3  Other sources   From Science of Cambridge  the new MK14
