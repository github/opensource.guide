François Marie Arouet    21 November 1694 – 30 May 1778   known by his nom de plume Voltaire       was a French Enlightenment writer  historian  and philosopher famous for his wit  his attacks on the established Catholic Church  and his advocacy of freedom of religion  freedom of expression  and separation of church and state  Voltaire was a versatile writer  producing works in almost every literary form  including plays  poems  novels  essays  and historical and scientific works  He wrote more than 20 000 letters and more than 2 000 books and pamphlets  He was an outspoken advocate  despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time  As a satirical polemicist  he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance  religious dogma  and the French institutions of his day   1  Biography  François Marie Arouet was born in Paris  the youngest of the five children  three of whom survived  of François Arouet  1650 – 1 January 1722   a lawyer who was a minor treasury official  and his wife  Marie Marguerite d Aumart  ca  1660 – 13 July 1701   from a noble family of the province of Poitou  Some speculation surrounds his date of birth  which Voltaire always claimed to be 20 February 1694  Voltaire was educated by the Jesuits at the Collège Louis le Grand  1704–1711   where he learned Latin and Greek  later in life he became fluent in Italian  Spanish and English   By the time he left school  Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer  against the wishes of his father  who wanted him to become a lawyer  Voltaire  pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary  spent much of his time writing poetry  When his father found out  he sent Voltaire to study law  this time in Caen  Normandy  Nevertheless  he continued to write  producing essays and historical studies  Voltaire s wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed  His father then obtained a job for him as a secretary to the French ambassador in the Netherlands  where Voltaire fell in love with a French Protestant refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer  Their scandalous elopement was foiled by Voltaire s father and he was forced to return to France   Most of Voltaire s early life revolved around Paris  From early on  Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government and religious intolerance  These activities were to result in numerous imprisonments and exiles  One satirical verse about the Régent  in which Voltaire accused the Regent of incest with his own daughter  led to his imprisonment in the Bastille for eleven months  While there  he wrote his debut play  Œdipe  Its success established his reputation   He mainly argued for religious toleration and freedom of thought  He believed in the concept of an enlightened monarch that would protect the peoples rights  He would only hope that the monarch would not oppress his subjects though   1 1  The name  Voltaire   The name  Voltaire   which the author adopted in 1718  is an anagram of  AROVET LI   the Latinized spelling of his surname  Arouet  and the initial letters of  le jeune    the young    The name also echoes in reverse order the syllables of the name of a family château in the Poitou region   Airvault   The adoption of the name  Voltaire  following his incarceration at the Bastille is seen by many to mark Voltaire s formal separation from his family and his past   Richard Holmes supports this derivation of the name  but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey its connotations of speed and daring  These come from associations with words such as  voltige   acrobatics on a trapeze or horse    volte face   a spinning about to face one s enemies   and  volatile   originally  any winged creature    Arouet  was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation  especially given that name s resonance with  à rouer    to be broken on the wheel  – a form of torture then still prevalent  and  roué   a  débauché     In a letter to Jean Baptiste Rousseau in March 1719  Voltaire concludes by asking that  if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter  he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire  A postscript explains   J ai été si malheureux sous le nom d Arouet que j en ai pris un autre surtout pour n être plus confondu avec le poète Roi    I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another  primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi   This probably refers to Adenes le Roi  and the  oi  diphthong was then pronounced like modern  ouai   so the similarity to  Arouet  is clear  and thus  it could well have been part of his rationale  Indeed  Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime   1 2  Great Britain  In 1726  Voltaire responded to an insult from the young French nobleman Chevalier de Rohan  whose servants beat him a few days later  Since Voltaire was seeking compensation  and was even willing to fight in a duel  the aristocratic Rohan family obtained a royal lettre de cachet  a decree signed by the French King  Louis XV  in the time of Voltaire  which was routinely used to dispose of troublemakers of many kinds  drunkards  violent people  unequal marriages  and so on   This warrant caused Voltaire to be imprisoned in the Bastille without a trial and without an opportunity to defend himself  Fearing an indefinite prison sentence  Voltaire suggested that he be exiled to England as an alternative punishment  which the French authorities accepted  This incident marked the beginning of Voltaire s attempts to reform the French judicial system  Madame de Pompadour was a close confidante of Voltaire and his first friend at court  Speaking of her  he said that in the bottom of her heart she belonged to the philosophers  and did as much as she could to protect them  She had known him before she was the maîtresse en titre  and charged him with the composition of a court piece  1745  to celebrate the marriage of the dauphin   From 1726 to 1728 he lodged in Maiden Lane  Covent Garden  now commemorated by a plaque at 10 Maiden Lane  Voltaire s exile in Great Britain lasted nearly three years  and his experiences there greatly influenced his thinking  He was intrigued by Britain s constitutional monarchy in contrast to the French absolute monarchy  and by the country s greater support of the freedoms of speech and religion  He was also influenced by several neoclassical writers of the age  and developed an interest in earlier English literature  especially the works of Shakespeare  still relatively unknown in continental Europe  Despite pointing out his deviations from neoclassical standards  Voltaire saw Shakespeare as an example that French writers might emulate  since French drama  despite being more polished  lacked on stage action  Later  however  as Shakespeare s influence began growing in France  Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays  decrying what he considered Shakespeare s barbarities  He was present at the funeral of Isaac Newton  and praised the British for honoring a scientist of heretical religious beliefs with burial at Westminster Abbey   After almost three years in exile  Voltaire returned to Paris  At a dinner  the mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts and Voltaire joined the consortium  earning perhaps a million livres  He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the court that he was of good conduct and so was able to receive an inheritance from his father that had earlier been refused  He was now seriously rich   In 1733 he met Émilie du Châtelet  who was twelve years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for sixteen years  as described in the work Voltaire in Love by Nancy Mitford  At this time he published his views on British attitudes toward government  literature  and religion in a collection of essays in letter form entitled Letters Concerning the English Nation  London  1733   In 1734  they were published in French as Lettres philosophiques in Rouen  A revised edition appeared in English in 1778 as Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais  Philosophical Letters on the English   Most modern English editions are based on the one from 1734 and typically use the title Philosophical Letters  a direct translation of that version s title   Because the publisher released the book without the approval of the royal censor and Voltaire regarded the British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights  particularly religious tolerance  than its French counterpart  the French publication of Letters caused a huge scandal  the book was burnt  After the book was banned  Voltaire was forced again to flee   1 3  Château de Cirey  Voltaire s next destination was the Château de Cirey  on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine  The building was renovated with his money  and here he began a relationship with the Marquise du Châtelet  Gabrielle Émilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil  famous in her own right as Émilie du Châtelet   Cirey was owned by the Marquise s husband  Marquis Florent Claude du Chatelet  who sometimes visited his wife and her lover at the chateau  The relationship  which lasted for fifteen years  had a significant intellectual element  Voltaire and the Marquise collected over 21 000 books  an enormous number for the time  Together  they studied these books and performed experiments in the  natural sciences  in his laboratory  Voltaire s experiments included an attempt to determine the elements of fire   Having learned from his previous brushes with the authorities  Voltaire began his habit of keeping out of personal harm s way  and denying any awkward responsibility  He continued to write plays  such as Mérope  or La Mérope française  and began his long research into science and history  Again  a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile  during which he had been strongly influenced by the works of Sir Isaac Newton  Voltaire strongly believed in Newton s theories  especially concerning optics  Newton s discovery that white light is composed of all the colours in the spectrum led to many experiments at Cirey   and gravity  Voltaire is the source of the famous story of Newton and the apple falling from the tree  which he had learned from Newton s niece in London and first mentioned in his  Essai sur la poésie épique   or  Essay on Epic Poetry     Although both Voltaire and the Marquise were curious about the philosophies of Gottfried Leibniz  a contemporary and rival of Newton  they remained essentially  Newtonians   despite the Marquise s adoption of certain aspects of Leibniz s arguments against Newton  She translated Newton s Latin Principia in full  adjusting a few errors along the way  and it remained the definitive French translation well into the 20th century  Voltaire s book Eléments de la philosophie de Newton  Elements of Newton s Philosophy   which was probably co written with the Marquise  made Newton accessible to a far greater public  The Marquise also wrote a celebratory review in the Journal des Savants  It is often considered the work that finally brought about general acceptance of Newton s optical and gravitational theories   Voltaire and the Marquise also studied history  particularly those persons who had contributed to civilization  Voltaire s second essay in English had been  Essay upon the Civil Wars in France   It was followed by La Henriade  an epic poem on the French King Henri IV  glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic Protestant massacres with the Edict of Nantes  and by a historical novel on King Charles XII of Sweden  These  along with his Letters on the English mark the beginning of Voltaire s open criticism of intolerance and established religions  Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy  particularly metaphysics  the branch of philosophy that deals with being and with what lies beyond the material realm such as whether or not there is a God or souls  etc  Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible  trying to discover its validity for their time  Voltaire s critical views on religion are reflected in his belief in separation of church and state and religious freedom  ideas that he had formed after his stay in England   In the fall of 1735  Voltaire was visited by Francesco Algarotti  preparing a book about Newton  In 1736 Frederick the Great started to write letters to Voltaire  Two years later Voltaire lived in Holland and became acquainted with Herman Boerhaave and  s Gravesande  In first half of 1740 Voltaire lived in Brussels and met with Lord Chesterfield  He went to see a dubious publisher Jan van Duuren in the Hague  because of the Anti Machiavel  written by the crown prince  and ordered it back  Voltaire lived in Huis Honselaarsdijk belonging to his admirer  In September they met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleve  in November Voltaire went to Rheinsberg Castle for two weeks  in August 1742 Voltaire and Frederick met in Aix la Chapelle  Voltaire was sent to Sanssouci by the French government  as an ambassador spy and find out more about Frederick plan s after the First Silesian War   Though deeply committed to the Marquise  Voltaire by 1744 found life at the château confining  On a visit to Paris that year  he found a new love–his niece  At first  his attraction to Marie Louise Mignot was clearly sexual  as evidenced by his letters to her  only discovered in 1957   Much later  they lived together  perhaps platonically  and remained together until Voltaire s death  Meanwhile  the Marquise also took a lover  the Marquis de Saint Lambert   1 4  Sanssouci  After the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749  Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in 1750 moved to Potsdam to meet Frederick the Great for the fifth time  The king now gave him a salary of 20 000 francs a year  Though life went well at first—in 1752 he wrote Micromégas  perhaps the first piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind—his relationship with Frederick the Great began to deteriorate and he encountered other difficulties  An argument with Maupertuis  the president of the Berlin Academy of Science  provoked Voltaire s  Diatribe du docteur Akakia    Diatribe of Doctor Akakia    which satirized some of Maupertuis  theories and his abuse of power in his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance  Johann Samuel König  This greatly angered Frederick  who had all copies of the document burned and Voltaire arrested at an inn where he was staying along his journey home   1 5  Geneva and Ferney  Voltaire headed toward Paris  but Louis XV banned him from the city  so instead he turned to Geneva  near which he bought a large estate  Les Délices  in 1755  Though he was received openly at first  the law in Geneva  which banned theatrical performances  and the publication of The Maid of Orleans against his will made him move at the end of 1758 across the French border to Ferney  where he had bought an even larger estate  and led to Voltaire s writing of Candide  ou l Optimisme  Candide  or Optimism  in 1759  This satire on Leibniz s philosophy of optimistic determinism remains the work for which Voltaire is perhaps best known  He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life  frequently entertaining distinguished guests  such as James Boswell  Adam Smith  Giacomo Casanova  and Edward Gibbon  In 1764  he published one of his best known philosophical works  the Dictionnaire Philosophique  a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas  a few of which were originally written in Berlin   From 1762  he began to champion unjustly persecuted people  the case of Jean Calas being the most celebrated  This Huguenot merchant had been tortured to death in 1763  supposedly because he had murdered his son for wanting to convert to Catholicism  His possessions were confiscated and his remaining children were taken from his widow and were forced to become members of a monastery  Voltaire  seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution  managed to overturn the conviction in 1765   Voltaire was initiated into Freemasonry the month before his death  On 4 April 1778 Voltaire accompanied his close friend Benjamin Franklin into Loge des Neuf Soeurs in Paris  France and became an Entered Apprentice Freemason   1 6  Death and burial  In February 1778  Voltaire returned for the first time in 20 years to Paris  among other reasons to see the opening of his latest tragedy  Irene  The five day journey was too much for the 83 year old  and he believed he was about to die on 28 February  writing  I die adoring God  loving my friends  not hating my enemies  and detesting superstition   However  he recovered  and in March saw a performance of Irene  where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero   He soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778  The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying  and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred  His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites given by a Catholic priest  or that he died under great torment  while his adherents told how he was defiant to his last breath  According to one story  his last words were   Now is not the time for making new enemies   It was his response to a priest at the side of his deathbed  asking Voltaire to renounce Satan   Because of his well known criticism of the Church  which he had refused to retract before his death  Voltaire was denied a Christian burial  but friends managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of Scellières in Champagne before this prohibition had been announced  His heart and brain were embalmed separately   On 11 July 1791  the National Assembly of France  which regarded him as a forerunner of the French Revolution  had his remains brought back to Paris to enshrine him in the Panthéon  It is estimated that a million people attended the procession  which stretched throughout Paris  There was an elaborate ceremony  complete with an orchestra  and the music included a piece that André Grétry had composed specially for the event  which included a part for the  tuba curva   an instrument that originated in Roman times as the cornu but had recently been revived under a new name    A widely repeated story  that the remains of Voltaire were stolen by religious fanatics in 1814 or 1821 during the Pantheon restoration and thrown into a garbage heap  is false  Such rumours resulted in the coffin being opened in 1897  which confirmed that his remains were still present   2  Writings  2 1  History  Voltaire had an enormous influence on the development of historiography through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past  His best known histories are The Age of Louis XIV  1751   and his Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations  1756   He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events  and emphasized customs  social history and achievements in the arts and sciences  The Essay on Customs traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context  thereby rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference  Influenced by Bossuet s Discourse on the Universal History  1682   he was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world  eliminating theological frameworks  and emphasizing economics  culture and political history  He treated Europe as a whole  rather than a collection of nations  He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization  but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages  Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian  he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages  Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed  Although he found evil in the historical record  he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress   Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on  History  in Diderot s Encyclopédie   One demands of modern historians more details  better ascertained facts  precise dates  more attention to customs  laws  mores  commerce  finance  agriculture  population   Voltaire s histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past  but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism  Eurocentrism  religious intolerance and a concentration on great men  diplomacy  and warfare  Yale professor Peter Gay says Voltaire wrote  very good history   citing his   scrupulous concern for truths    careful sifting of evidence    intelligent selection of what is important    keen sense of drama   and  grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study    2 2  Poetry  From an early age  Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse and his first published work was poetry  He wrote two book long epic poems  including the first ever written in French  the Henriade  and later  The Maid of Orleans  besides many other smaller pieces   The Henriade was written in imitation of Virgil  using the Alexandrine couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century  with sixty five editions and translations into several languages  The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes  La Pucelle  on the other hand  is a burlesque on the legend of Joan of Arc  Voltaire s minor poems are generally considered superior to either of these two works   2 3  Prose  Many of Voltaire s prose works and romances  usually composed as pamphlets  were written as polemics  Candide attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz s philosophy of optimism  L Homme aux quarante ecus  The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver   certain social and political ways of the time  Zadig and others  the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy  and some were written to deride the Bible  In these works  Voltaire s ironic style  free of exaggeration  is apparent  particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment  Candide in particular is the best example of his style  Voltaire also has  in common with Jonathan Swift  the distinction of paving the way for science fiction s philosophical irony  particularly in his Micromégas and the vignette Plato s Dream  1756    In general  his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire s other works  Almost all of his more substantive works  whether in verse or prose  are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another  which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone  In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings  he displays his skills at journalism  In pure literary criticism his principal work is the Commentaire sur Corneille  although he wrote many more similar workssometimes  as in his Life and Notices of Molière  independently and sometimes as part of his Siècles   Voltaire s works  especially his private letters  frequently contain the word  l infâme  and the expression  écrasez l infâme   or  crush the infamous   The phrase refers to abuses of the people by royalty and the clergy that Voltaire saw around him  and the superstition and intolerance that the clergy bred within the people  He had felt these effects in his own exiles  the burnings of his books and those of many others  and in the hideous sufferings of Calas and La Barre  He stated in one of his most famous quotes that  Superstition sets the whole world in flames  philosophy quenches them    The most oft cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal  He is incorrectly credited with writing   I disapprove of what you say  but I will defend to the death your right to say it   These were not his words  but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall  written under the pseudonym S  G  Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book The Friends of Voltaire  Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire s attitude towards Claude Adrien Helvétius and his controversial book De l esprit  but her first person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire  Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire s attitude towards Helvetius  it had been said Hall s summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche  in which he was reported to have said   I detest what you write  but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write   Nevertheless  scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation  as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote   Voltaire s first major philosophical work in his battle against  l infâme  was the Traité sur la tolérance  Treatise on Tolerance   exposing the Calas affair  along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras  for example  by the Jews  the Romans  the Greeks and the Chinese   Then  in his Dictionnaire philosophique  containing such articles as  Abraham    Genesis    Church Council   he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs  as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects  Amongst other targets  Voltaire criticized France s colonial policy in North America  dismissing the vast territory of New France as  a few acres of snow    quelques arpents de neige     2 4  Letters  Voltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life  totaling over 20 000 letters  Theodore Besterman s collected edition of these letters  completed only in 1964  fills 102 volumes  One historian called the letters  a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship  humane feeling  and incisive thought    3  Philosophy  3 1  Religion  Like other key thinkers during the European Enlightenment  Voltaire might have considered himself a deist  expressing the idea   What is faith  Is it to believe that which is evident  No  It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary  eternal  supreme  and intelligent being  This is no matter of faith  but of reason    In the Scottish Enlightenment  the Scots began developing a uniquely practical branch of humanism to the extent that Voltaire said   We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation    3 1 1  Bible  As for religious texts  Voltaire s opinion of the Bible was mixed  Although influenced by Socinian works such as the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum  Voltaire s skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical political writers like John Locke   This did not hinder his religious practice  though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles  The deeply Christian Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire s death  saying   The arch scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket        3 1 2  Islam  In his tragedy Le Fanatisme ou Mahomet  Voltaire described Mohammed as an  impostor   a   false prophet   a  fanatic  and a  hypocrite   Voltaire defended the play  he said that he  tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism  led by an impostor  can plunge weak minds    When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to César de Missy  he described Mohammed as a  deceitful character    In 1748  after having read Henri de Boulainvilliers and George Sale  he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in an article   De l Alcoran et de Mahomet   On the Quran and on Mohammed   In the article  Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a  sublime charlatan  Drawing also on complementary information in the  Oriental Library  of Herbelot  Voltaire  according to René Pomeau  had a judgement of Qur an where he found the book in spite of  the contradictions  the absurdities  the anachronisms    rhapsody  without connection  without order  and without art   Thus he  henceforward conceded  that  if his book was bad for our times and for us  it was very good for his contemporaries  and his religion even more so  It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry  and that  it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion  taught by a man who was constantly victorious  could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth   He considered that  its civil laws are good  its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours  but that  his means are shocking  deception and murder    In his play  Mohammed was  whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying  Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command   After later having judged that he had made Mohammed in his play  somewhat nastier than he really was   Voltaire claims that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians  who are often referred to as  Magi   Voltaire continues about Islam that  In his Essai sur les mœurs et l esprit des Nations  in which he devoted  as a historian this time  several chapters to Islam  Voltaire highlighted the Arabian  Turkish courts  and conducts  Here he called Mohammed a  poet   and furthermore he was not an illiterate  as a  legislator  who  changed the face of part of Europe  one half of Asia   In the chapter VI  Voltaire finds similarities Arabs and ancient Hebrews  that they both kept running to battle in the name of god  and sharing the passion for booty and spoils  Voltaire continues that   It is to be believed that Mohammed  like all enthusiasts  violently struck by his ideas  first presented them in good faith  strengthened them with fantasy  fooled himself in fooling others  and supported through necessary deceptions a doctrine which he considered good    However  Voltaire was fundamentally a Deist and clearly denounced Islam and monotheistic religions in general  Taking advantage of the definition of theism in his  Philosophical Dictionary   he put Islam and Christianity back to back with each other    The theist  believes that religion consists neither in the opinions of an unintelligible metaphysics  nor in vain apparatus  but in worship and in justice  To do good  that is his prayer  to be submitted to God  that is his doctrine  The Mohammedan calls to him  Beware if you do not make your pilgrimage to Mecca    Woe on you  says a recoller to him  if you do not make a journey to Notre Dame de Lorette   He laughs at Lorette and at Mecca  but he helps the poor and defends the oppressed  Thus  there are a number of representations of Mohammed in Voltaire  a religious one  according to which Mohammed is a prophet like the others  who exploits people s naivety and spreads superstition and fanaticism  and the other a political one  according to which Mohammed was a legislator who brought his contemporaries out of idolatry  According to Diego Venturino the figure of Mohammed is uncertain or negative in Voltaire s view  as Voltaire applaud the legislator but hates the conqueror and the pontiff  who established his religion through violence  In his Essai sur les mœurs  he highlighted the Arabian  Turkish courts  and conducts  He thus compares  the genius of the Arab people  with  the genius of the ancient Romans   His statements about religions also brought down on him the fury of the Jesuits and in particular Claude Adrien Nonnotte   Voltaire s views about Islam remained negative  he considered Quran to be ignoring the laws of physics  In a 1740 letter to Frederick II of Prussia  Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that  is assuredly nothing any man can excuse  and suggests that his following stemmed from superstition and lack of enlightenment  Voltaire continued in his letter   But that a camel merchant should stir up insurrection in his village  that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel  that he boasts of having been carried to heaven  where he received in part this unintelligible book  each page of which makes common sense shudder  that  to pay homage to this book  he delivers his country to iron and flame  that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters  that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death  this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse  at least if he was not born a Turk  or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him   – Referring to Muhammad  in a letter to Frederick II of Prussia  December 1740   published in Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire  Vol  7  1869   edited by Georges Avenel  p  105  In a 1745 letter recommending his play Fanaticism  or Mahomet to Pope Benedict XIV  Voltaire described the founder of Islam  Muhammad as  the founder of a false and barbarous sect  and  a false prophet   Voltaire wrote that  Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful  though a zealous admirer of virtue  of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance  written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect  To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet  than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy    His view was modified slightly for Essai sur les Moeurs et l Esprit des Nations  however they remained negative  In 1751  Voltaire performed his play Mohamet once again  with great success   3 1 3  Christianity  In a letter to Frederick II  King of Prussia  dated 5 January 1767  he wrote about Christianity   In La bible enfin expliquee  he considered Bible as   It is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves  God killed  so I must kill  Abraham lied  Jacob deceived  Rachel stole  so I must steal  deceive  lie  But  wretch  you are neither Rachel  nor Jacob  nor Abraham  nor God  you are just a mad fool  and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise   3 1 4  Hinduism  Despite the criticism of Abrahamic religions  Voltaire had a positive view of Hinduism  the sacred text Vedas was remarked on by him as follows   The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East  He regarded Hindus as   a  peaceful and innocent people  equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves   Voltaire was himself a supporter of animal rights   Voltaire was vegetarian  He used the ancient times of Hinduism to land a devastating blow to the Bible s claims and acknowledged that the Hindus  treatment of animals shown a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists   3 1 5  Judaism  According to the rabbi Joseph Telushkin  the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire  thirty of the 118 articles in his Dictionnaire philosophique dealt with Jews and described them in consistently negative ways   On the other hand  Peter Gay  a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment  also points to Voltaire s remarks  for instance  that the Jews were more tolerant than the Christians  in the Traité sur la tolérance and surmises that  Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity   Whatever anti semitism Voltaire may have felt  Gay suggests  derived from negative personal experience  Bertram Schwarzbach s far more detailed studies of Voltaire s dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti biblical  not anti semitic  His remarks on the Jews and their  superstitions  were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians   Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation  repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews  Arthur Hertzberg claims that Gay s second suggestion is also untenable  as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had  forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians    3 2  Religious tolerance  In a 1763 essay  Voltaire supported the toleration of other religions and ethnicities   It does not require great art  or magnificently trained eloquence  to prove that Christians should tolerate each other  I  however  am going further  I say that we should regard all men as our brothers  What  The Turk my brother  The Chinaman my brother  The Jew  The Siam  Yes  without doubt  are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God    3 3  Race and slavery  Voltaire rejected the Christian Adam and Eve story and was a polygenist who speculated that each race had separate origins  Like other philosophes  such as Buffon  he divided humanity into varieties or races and attempted to explain the differences between these races  He wondered if blacks fully shared in the common humanity or intelligence of whites because of their participation in the slave trade   His most famous remark on slavery is found in Candide  where the hero is horrified to learn  at what price we eat sugar in Europe  after coming across a slave in French Guinea who has been mutilated for escaping  who opines that  if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught  it makes them cousins  concluding that  no one could treat their relatives more horribly   Elsewhere  he wrote caustically about  whites and Christians  who  proceed to purchase negroes cheaply  in order to sell them dear in America   Voltaire believed in the inferiority of Africans and supported the slave trade   4  Legacy  Voltaire perceived the French bourgeoisie to be too small and ineffective  the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt  the commoners as ignorant and superstitious  and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings  although all too often  even more rapacious itself  Voltaire distrusted democracy  which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses  Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change  given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy  and that it was in the king s rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects  But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat  and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works  his novella Candide  ou l Optimisme  Candide  or Optimism  1759   which ends with a new conclusion   It is up to us to cultivate our garden   His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later  Candide was also burned and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain  Demad  in a letter  where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text   He is remembered and honoured in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights  as the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion  and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the Ancien Régime  The Ancien Régime – according to common opinion – involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three Estates  clergy and nobles on one side  the commoners and middle class  who were burdened with most of the taxes  on the other  He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by Confucius   Voltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms  such as  Si Dieu n existait pas  il faudrait l inventer    If God did not exist  it would be necessary to invent him    contained in a verse epistle from 1768  addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on The Three Impostors  But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for  it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as d Holbach  Grimm  and others  He has had his detractors among his later colleagues  The Scottish Victorian writer Thomas Carlyle argued that  Voltaire read history  not with the eye of devout seer or even critic  but through a pair of mere anti catholic spectacles    The town of Ferney  where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life  is now named Ferney Voltaire in honour of its most famous resident  His château is a museum  Voltaire s library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg  Russia  In the Zurich of 1916  the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant garde movement Dada named their theater The Cabaret Voltaire  A late 20th century industrial music group then named themselves after the theater  Astronomers have bestowed his name to the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire   Besides  Voltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee  as he was purported to have drunk it 50–72 times per day  It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine acted as a mental stimulant to his creativity  His great grand niece was the mother of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  a catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest  His book Candide was listed as one of The 100 Most
