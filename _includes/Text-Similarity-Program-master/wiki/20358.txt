Music lessons are a type of formal instruction in playing a musical instrument or singing  Typically  a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one on one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years  For vocal lessons  teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe  and how to position the head  chest  and mouth for good vocal tone  For instrument lessons  teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument  how to hold the instrument  and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument  Music teachers also assign technical exercises  musical pieces  and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills  While most music lessons are one on one  private   some teachers also teach groups of two to four students  semi private lessons   and  for very basic instruction  some instruments are taught in large group lessons  such as piano and acoustic guitar  Private lessons can also take place through live video chat using webcam and Videotelephony on websites such as LessonFace com and ArtistWorks com   Music lessons are part of both amateur music instruction and professional training  In amateur and recreational music contexts  children and adults take music lessons to improve their singing or playing skills and learn basic techniques  In professional training contexts  such as music conservatories  university music performance programs  e g   Bachelor of music  Master of music  DMA  etc    students take a music lesson once a week for an hour or more with a music professor over a period of years to learn advanced playing or singing techniques  Many instrumental performers and singers  including a number of music celebrities  have learned  by ear   especially in folk music styles such as blues and popular styles such as rock music  Nevertheless  even in folk and popular styles  a number of performers have had some type of music lessons  such as meeting with a vocal coach or getting childhood instruction in an instrument such as piano   1  Posture  For vocal lessons  teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe  and how to position the head and mouth for good vocal tone  For instrument lessons  teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument  how to hold the instrument  and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument  For wind and brass instruments  the teacher shows the student how to use their lips  tongue  and breath to produce tones and sounds  For some instruments  teachers also train students in the use of the feet  as in the case of piano or other keyboard instruments that have damper or sustain pedals on the piano  the pedal keyboard on a pipe organ  and some drums and cymbals in the drum kit such as the bass drum pedal and the hi hat cymbal pedal  In addition to teaching fingering  teachers also provide other types of instruction  A guitar player learns how to strum and pluck strings  players of wind instruments learn about breath control and embouchure  and singers learn how to make the most of their vocal cords without hurting the throat or vocal cords   Teachers also show students how to achieve the correct posture for most efficient playing results  For all instruments  the best way to move the fingers and arms to achieve a desired effect is to learn to play with the least tension in your hands and body  This also prevents forming habits which may lead to injuries resulting from incorrect use of the skeletal frame and muscles  For example  when playing the piano   fingering  舒 that is  which fingers to put on which keys舒is a skill slowly learned as the student advances  and there are many standard techniques which a teacher can pass on   There are many myths and misconceptions among music teachers  especially in the Western classical tradition  about  good  posture and  bad  posture  Students who find that playing their instruments causes them physical pain should bring this to their teachers  attention  It could be a potentially serious health risk  but it is often overlooked when learning to play an instrument  Learning to use one s body in a manner consistent with the way their anatomy is designed to work can mean the difference between a crippling injury and a lifetime of enjoyment  Many music teachers would caution students about taking  no pain  no gain  as an acceptable response from their music teacher regarding a complaint of physical pain  Concerns about use related injury and the ergonomics of musicianship have gained more mainstream acceptance in recent years  Musicians have increasingly been turning to medical professionals  physical therapists  and specialized techniques seeking relief from pain and prevention of serious injury  There exists a plurality of special techniques for an even greater plurality of potential difficulties  The Alexander Technique is just one example of these specialized approaches   2  Theory and history  In order to more fully understand the music being played  the student must learn about the underlying music theory  Along with reading musical notation  students learn rhythmic techniques like controlling tempo and recognizing time signatures  as well as the theory of harmony  including chords and key signatures  In addition to basic theory  a good teacher will stress musicality  or how to make the music sound good  This includes tone  phrasing  and proper use of dynamics   Most music lessons include some instruction in the history of the type of music that the student is learning  When a student is taking western classical music lessons  music teachers often spend some time explaining the different eras of western classical music  such as the Baroque Era  the Classical era  the Romantic Era  and the Modern Era  because each era is associated with different styles of music and different performance practice techniques  Instrumental music from the Baroque era is often played in the 2000s as teaching pieces for piano students  string instrument players  and wind instrument players  If students just try to play these Baroque pieces by reading the notes from the score  they might not get the right type of interpretation  However  once a student learns that most Baroque instrumental music was associated with dances  such as the gavotte and the sarabande  and keyboard music from the Baroque era was played on the harpsichord or the pipe organ  a modern day student is better able to understand how the piece should be played  If  for example  a cello player is assigned a gavotte that was originally written for harpsichord  this gives the student insight in how to play the piece  Since it is a dance  it should have a regular  clear pulse  rather than a Romantic era style shifting tempo rubato  As well  since it was originally written for the harpsichord  a light sounding keyboard instrument in which the strings are plucked with quills  this suggests that the notes should be played relatively lightly  and with spaces between each note  rather than in a full bodied  sustained legato   3  Technical exercises  Although not universally accepted  many teachers drill students with the repetitive playing of certain patterns  such as scales  arpeggios  and rhythms  Scales are often taught because they are the building blocks of melody in most Western art music  In addition  there are flexibility studies  which make it physically easier to play the instrument  Percussion instruments use rudiments that help in the development of sticking patterns  roll techniques and other little nuances such as flams and drags  There are sets of exercises for piano designed to stretch the connection between fourth and fifth fingers  making them more independent  Brass players practice lip slurs  which are unarticulated changes in embouchure between partials  Woodwind players  Saxophone  Clarinet  and Flute  have a multitude of exercises to help with tonguing techniques  finger dexterity  and tone development  Entire books of etudes have been written to this purpose   4  Pieces  The teacher will give the student a set of pieces of slowly increasing difficulty  Besides using pieces as an aid to teaching various elements of playing style  a good teacher will also inspire more intangible qualities such as expressiveness and musicianship  Pieces are more enjoyable for most students than theory or scales  and an emphasis on pieces is usually required to maintain motivation  However  the teacher must not give in to the student s desire for  fun  pieces  Often the student s idea of such is popular vocal selections  movie soundtracks  etc  The pieces that one plays should challenge and tone a persons skills  The student should learn something from every piece he she plays  In addition  in order for a student to be well rounded he she must play many types of pieces by many different composers from different eras  A varied library of repertoire will increase the student s musical understanding and skill   5  Examinations  A popular measure of progress  especially for children  is external assessment of the progress of the pupil by a regular examination  There are a number of exam boards which offer the chance for pupils to be assessed on either music theory or practice  These are available for almost every musical instrument One common way to mark progress is to have graded examinations  for example from grade 1  beginner  to grade 8  ready to enter higher study at music school   Some teachers prefer other methods of target setting for their pupils  The most common is the pupil s concert  which gives experience in playing in public and under a certain degree of pressure  without outright criticism or a more or less arbitrary marking system  Another is the graded system of books followed by teachers of the Suzuki method  in which the completion of each book is celebrated  without a system of marking or ranking of pupils   6  Extra musical benefits  Some studies suggests that music lessons provide children with important developmental benefits beyond simply the knowledge or skill of playing a musical instrument  Research suggests that musical lessons may enhance intelligence and academic achievement  build self esteem and improve discipline  A recent Rockefeller Foundation Study found that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical schools  followed by biochemistry and the humanities  On SAT tests  the national average scores were 427 on the verbal and 476 on math  At the same time  music students averaged 465 on the verbal and 497 on the math   38 and 21 points higher  respectively  However  the observed correlation between musical and mathematical ability may be inherent rather than acquired  Furthermore  it is possible that the correlation between taking music lessons and academic ability exists because both are strongly correlated with parental income and education  Even if music lessons had no impact on academic ability  one would expect to see a correlation between music lessons and academic ability   Skills learned through the discipline of music may transfer to study skills  communication skills  and cognitive skills useful in every part of a child s studies at school  though  An in depth Harvard University study found evidence that spatial temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music  and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music  including Mozart  Rauscher  Shaw & Ky  1993   This finding which has been named  The Mozart effect  suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically  i e   they may rely on some of the same underlying skills  and perhaps neurologically as well  However  there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher  e g  Steele  Bass & Crook  1999   questioned both theory and methodology of the original study  Fudis & Lembesis 2004  and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal  Thompson  Schellenberg & Husain  2001    A relationship between music and the strengthening of math  dance  reading  creative thinking and visual arts skills has also been reported in literature   Winner  Hetland  Sanni  as reported in The Arts and Academic Achievement   What the Evidence Shows  2000  However recent findings by Dr  Levitin of McGill University in Montreal  Canada  undermines the suggested connection between musical ability and higher math skills  In a study conducted on patients with Williams Syndrome  a genetic disorder causing low intelligence   he found that even though their intelligence was that of young children they still possessed unusually high level of musical ability   7  See also  Band sectional  Clinic  music   Five finger exercise  Learning music by ear  Master class  Music Education  School band  8  References
