In computing a legacy system is an old method  technology  computer system  or application program  of  relating to  or being a previous or outdated computer system   Often a pejorative term  referencing a system as  legacy  often implies that the system is out of date or in need of replacement   1  Overview  The first use of the term legacy to describe computer systems probably occurred in the 1970s  By the 1980s it was commonly used to refer to existing computer systems to distinguish them from the design and implementation of new systems  Legacy was often heard during a conversion process  for example  when moving data from the legacy system to a new database   While this term may indicate that some engineers may feel that a system is out of date  a legacy system may continue to be used for a variety of reasons  It may simply be that the system still provides for the users  needs  In addition  the decision to keep an old system may be influenced by economic reasons such as return on investment challenges or vendor lock in  the inherent challenges of change management  or a variety of other reasons other than functionality  Backward compatibility  such as the ability of newer systems to handle legacy file formats and character encodings  is a goal that software developers often include in their work   Even if it is no longer used  a legacy system may continue to impact the organization due to its historical role  Historic data may not have been converted into the new system format and may exist within the new system with the use of a customized schema crosswalk  or may exist only in a data warehouse  In either case  the effect on business intelligence and operational reporting can be significant  A legacy system may include procedures or terminology which are no longer relevant in the current context  and may hinder or confuse understanding of the methods or technologies used   Organizations can have compelling reasons for keeping a legacy system  such as   The system works satisfactorily  and the owner sees no reason to change it   The costs of redesigning or replacing the system are prohibitive because it is large  monolithic  and or complex   Retraining on a new system would be costly in lost time and money  compared to the anticipated appreciable benefits of replacing it  which may be zero    The system requires near constant availability  so it cannot be taken out of service  and the cost of designing a new system with a similar availability level is high  Examples include systems to handle customers  accounts in banks  computer reservation systems  air traffic control  energy distribution  power grids   nuclear power plants  military defense installations  and systems such as the TOPS database   The way that the system works is not well understood  Such a situation can occur when the designers of the system have left the organization  and the system has either not been fully documented or documentation has been lost   The user expects that the system can easily be replaced when this becomes necessary   2  Problems Posed by Legacy Computing  Legacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic by some software engineers for several reasons  for example  see Bisbal et al   1999    If legacy software runs on only antiquated hardware  the cost of maintaining the system may eventually outweigh the cost of replacing both the software and hardware unless some form of emulation or backward compatibility allows the software to run on new hardware   These systems can be hard to maintain  improve  and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system  the staff who were experts on it have retired or forgotten what they knew about it  and staff who entered the field after it became  legacy  never learned about it in the first place  This can be worsened by lack or loss of documentation  Comair airline company fired its CEO in 2004 due to the failure of an antiquated legacy crew scheduling system that ran into a limitation not known to anyone in the company   Legacy systems may have vulnerabilities in older operating systems or applications due to lack of security patches being available or applied  There can also be production configurations that cause security problems  These issues can put the legacy system at risk of being compromised by attackers or knowledgeable insiders   Integration with newer systems may also be difficult because new software may use completely different technologies  Integration across technology is quite common in computing  but integration between newer technologies and substantially older ones is not common  There may simply not be sufficient demand for integration technology to be developed  Some of this  glue  code is occasionally developed by vendors and enthusiasts of particular legacy technologies   3  Improvements on legacy software systems  Where it is impossible to replace legacy systems through the practice of application retirement  it is still possible to enhance  or  re face   them  Most development often goes into adding new interfaces to a legacy system  The most prominent technique is to provide a Web based interface to a terminal based mainframe application  This may reduce staff productivity due to slower response times and slower mouse based operator actions  yet it is often seen as an  upgrade   because the interface style is familiar to unskilled users and is easy for them to use  John McCormick discusses such strategies that involve middleware   Printing improvements are problematic because legacy software systems often add no formatting instructions  or they use protocols that are not usable in modern PC Windows printers  A print server can be used to intercept the data and translate it to a more modern code  Rich Text Format  RTF  or PostScript documents may be created in the legacy application and then interpreted at a PC before being printed   Biometric security measures are difficult to implement on legacy systems  A workable solution is to use a telnet or http proxy server to sit between users and the mainframe to implement secure access to the legacy application   The change being undertaken in some organizations is to switch to Automated Business Process  ABP  software which generates complete systems  These systems can then interface to the organizations  legacy systems and use them as data repositories  This approach can provide a number of significant benefits  the users are insulated from the inefficiencies of their legacy systems  and the changes can be incorporated quickly and easily in the ABP software    Model driven reverse and forward engineering approaches can be also used for the improvement of legacy software  Model driven tools and methodologies can support the migration of legacy software to Cloud computing environments and allow for its modernization  in the notion of Software as a service  exploiting the advanced business and technical characteristics of clouds   4  NASA example  Andreas Hein  from the University of Stuttgart  researched the use of legacy systems in Space exploration  According to Hein  legacy systems are attractive for reuse if an organization has the capabilities for verification  validation  testing  and operational history These capabilities must be integrated into various software life cycle phases such as development  implementation  usage  or maintenance  For software systems  the capability to use and maintain the system are crucial  Otherwise the system will become less and less understandable and maintainable   According to Hein  Verification  validation  testing  and operational history increases the confidence in a system s reliability and quality  However  accumulating this history is often expensive  NASA s now retired Space Shuttle program used a large amount of 1970s era technology  Replacement was cost prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification  The original hardware completed the expensive integration and certification requirement for flight  but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again  This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program  Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a de facto legacy system by the time it is approved for flight   Additionally  the entire Space Shuttle system  including ground and launch vehicle assets  was designed to work together as a closed system  Since the specifications did not change  all of the certified systems and components performed well in the roles for which they were designed  Even before the Shuttle was scheduled to be retired in 2010  NASA found it advantageous to keep using many pieces of 1970s technology rather than to upgrade those systems and recertify the new components   5  Additional uses of the term Legacy in computing  The term legacy support is often used in conjunction with legacy systems  The term may refer to a feature of modern software  For example  Operating systems with  legacy support  can detect and use older hardware  The term may also be used to refer to a business function  e g  A software or hardware vendor that is supporting  or providing software maintenance  for older products   A  legacy  product may be a product that is no longer sold  has lost substantial market share  or is a version of a product that is not current  A legacy product may have some advantage over a modern product making it appealing for customers to keep it around  A product is only truly  obsolete  if it has an advantage to nobody – if no person making a rational decision would choose to acquire it new   The term  legacy mode  often refers specifically to backward compatibility  A software product that is capable of performing as though it were a previous version of itself  is said to be  running in legacy mode   This kind of feature is common in operating systems and internet browsers  where many applications depend on these underlying components   The computer mainframe era saw many applications running in legacy mode  In the modern business computing environment  n tier  or 3 tier architectures are more difficult to place into legacy mode as they include many components making up a single system   Virtualization technology is a recent innovation allowing legacy systems to continue to operate on modern hardware by running older operating systems and browsers on a software system that emulates legacy hardware   6  Brownfield architecture  The field of Information Technology has borrowed the term brownfield from the building industry  where undeveloped land  and especially unpolluted land  is described as greenfield and previously developed land 舑 which is often polluted and abandoned 舑 is described as brownfield   A brownfield architecture is a type of software or network architecture that incorporates legacy systems   A brownfield deployment is an upgrade or addition to an existing software or network architecture that retains legacy components   7  Alternative view  There is an alternate point of view 舒 growing since the  Dot Com  bubble burst in 1999 舒 that legacy systems are simply computer systems that are both installed and working  In other words  the term is not pejorative  but the opposite  Bjarne Stroustrup  creator of the C++ language  addressed this issue succinctly   IT analysts estimate that the cost of replacing business logic is about five times that of reuse  and that is not counting the risks involved in wholesale replacement  Ideally  businesses would never have to rewrite most core business logic  debits must equal credits 舒 they always have  and they always will  New software may increase the risk of system failures and security breaches   The IT industry is responding to these concerns   Legacy modernization  and  legacy transformation  refer to the act of reusing and refactoring existing core business logic by providing new user interfaces  typically Web interfaces   sometimes through the use of techniques such as screen scraping and service enabled access  e g  through web services   These techniques allow organizations to understand their existing code assets  using discovery tools   provide new user and application interfaces to existing code  improve workflow  contain costs  minimize risk  and enjoy classic qualities of service  near 100% uptime  security  scalability  etc     The re examination of attitudes toward legacy systems is also inviting more reflection on what makes legacy systems as durable as they are  Technologists are relearning that sound architecture  practiced up front  helps businesses avoid costly and risky rewrites in the first place  The most common legacy systems tend to be those which embraced well known IT architectural principles  with careful planning and strict methodology during implementation  Poorly designed systems often don t last  both because they wear out and because their reliability or usability are low enough that no one is inclined to make an effort to extend their term of service when replacement is an option  Thus  many organizations are rediscovering the value of both their legacy systems themselves and those systems  philosophical underpinnings   8  See also  Application retirement  Bitrot  Data migration  Legacy code  Legacy encoding  Legacy port  Software
