Chief of Klang  Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar Raja Abdullah  hired some Chinese labourers to open new and larger tin mines for tin prospectors  The miners landed at the confluence of Sungai Gombak  previously known as Sungai Lumpur  meaning  muddy river   and Sungai Klang  Klang River  to open mines at Ampang  Pudu and Batu  These mines developed into a trading post that became a frontier town   The tin prospectors settled in Ampang  and formed gangs within themselves  The two largest Chinese gangs  the Hakka dominated Hai San and the Hokkien dominated Ghee Hin  frequently engaged in warfare to gain control of tin production in the town  The incessant warfare between the two factions brought tin mine production to a standstill  prompting the British  who ruled Selangor as one of the Federated Malay States at the time  to appoint a Chinese Kapitan  headman  to administer Kuala Lumpur  Hiu Siew  the owner of a mine in Lukut  was elected as the first Kapitan  As one of the first traders to arrive in Ampang  along with Yap Ah Sze   he sold provisions to the miners in exchange for tin   During the early times  Kuala Lumpur had many problems  including the Selangor Civil War  it was also plagued by diseases and constant fires and floods  Around the 1870s  the third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur  Yap Ah Loy  emerged as leader  and became responsible for the survival and subsequent systematic growth of this town  He began to develop Kuala Lumpur from a small  obscure settlement into a booming mining town  In 1880  the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur   1 1  Redevelopment of modern Kuala Lumpur  In 1881  a flood swept through the town  following a fire that had engulfed it earlier  These successive problems destroyed the town s structures of wood and atap  thatching   The aftermath had rendered the town in a muddy state  As the town lies in the confluence of two rivers  Klang River and Gombak River  the town was later given its name Kuala Lumpur  which means muddy estuary  As a response  Frank Swettenham  the British Resident of Selangor  required that buildings be constructed of brick and tile  Hence  Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate to set up a brick industry  which spurred the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur  This place is the eponymous Brickfields  Hence  destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones  He restructured the building layout of the city  Many of the new brick buildings mirrored those of shop houses in southern China  characterised by  five foot ways  as well as skilled Chinese carpentry work  This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region  A railway line increased accessibility into the growing town  Development intensified in the 1890s  leading to the creation of a Sanitary Board  Kapitan Yap Ah Loy spent a sum of $20 000 to expand road access in the city significantly  linking up tin mines with the city  these roads include the main arterial roads of Ampang Road  Pudu Road and Petaling Street   As Chinese Kapitan  he was vested with wide powers on par with Malay community leaders  He implemented law reforms and introduced new legal measures  He also presided over a small claims court  With a police force of six  he was able to uphold to rule of law  He built a prison that could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time  Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur s first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor s Sultan Abdul Samad had an interest   In 1896  Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States  A mixture of different communities settled in various sections of Kuala Lumpur  The Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square  east of the Klang River  and towards Chinatown  The Malays  Indian Chettiars  and Indian Muslims resided along Java Street  now Jalan Tun Perak   The Padang  now known as Merdeka Square  was the centre of the British administrative offices   1 2  World War II  During World War II  Kuala Lumpur was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942  They occupied the city until 15 August 1945  when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia  Seishirō Itagaki  surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Kuala Lumpur grew through the war  the rubber and tin commodity crashes and the Malayan Emergency  during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency  In 1957  the Federation of Malaya gained its independence from British rule  Kuala Lumpur remained the capital through the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963   1 3  13 May 1969 riots and beyond  On 13 May 1969  the worst race riots on record in Malaysia took place in Kuala Lumpur  The so called 13 May incident refers to the occurrence of violence between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities  The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio political status  The riots resulted in the deaths of 196 people  and led to major changes in the country s economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities   Kuala Lumpur later achieved city status in 1972  becoming the first settlement in Malaysia to be granted the status after independence  Later  on 1 February 1974  Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory  Kuala Lumpur ceased to be the capital of Selangor in 1978 after the city of Shah Alam was declared the new state capital  On 14 May 1990  Kuala Lumpur celebrated 100 years of local council  The new federal territory Kuala Lumpur flag and anthem were introduced   On 1 February 2001  Putrajaya was declared a Federal Territory  as well as the seat of the federal government  The administrative and judicial functions of the

Jakarta and Manila  most of Kuala Lumpur s colonial buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries  These buildings have Moorish  Tudor  Neo Gothic or Grecian Spanish style or architecture  Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate  which is hot and humid all year around  Prior to the Second World War  many shophouses  usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs  were built around the old city centre  These shop houses drew inspiration from

Tuanku Abdul Rahman  Jalan Doraisamy  Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas   Independence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official
