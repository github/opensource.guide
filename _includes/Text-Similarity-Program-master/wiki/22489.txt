Oklahoma  Cherokee  ᎣᎦᎳᎰᎹ  òɡàlàhoma   Pawnee  Uukuhuúwa  Cayuga  Gahnawiyoˀgeh  is a state located in the South Central United States  Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States  The state s name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma  meaning  red people   It is also known informally by its nickname  The Sooner State  in reference to the non Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land prior to the official opening date  and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889  which opened the door for white settlement in America s Indian Territory  The name was settled upon statehood  Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name  On November 16  1907  Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union  Its residents are known as Oklahomans or  informally  Okies   and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City   A major producer of natural gas  oil  and agricultural products  Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation  energy  telecommunications  and biotechnology  In 2007  it had one of the fastest growing economies in the nation  ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth  Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma s primary economic anchors  with nearly two thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas   With small mountain ranges  prairie  mesas  and eastern forests  most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U S  Interior Highlands—a region especially prone to severe weather  In addition to having a prevalence of English  German  Scottish  Scotch Irish  and Native American ancestry  more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma  second only to California   Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives  a destination for southern settlers  and a government sanctioned territory for Native Americans   1  Etymology  The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw phrase okla humma  literally meaning red people  Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory  in which he envisioned an all Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs  Equivalent to the English word Indian  okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole  Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory  and it was officially approved in 1890  two years after the area was opened to white settlers   2  Geography  Oklahoma is the 20th largest state in the United States  covering an area of 69 898 square miles  181 035 km2   with 68 667 square miles  177847 km2  of land and 1 281 square miles  3 188 km2  of water  It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip  and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states  It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri  on the north by Kansas  on the northwest by Colorado  on the far west by New Mexico  and on the south and near west by Texas   The western edge of the Oklahoma panhandle is out of alignment with its Texas border  The Oklahoma New Mexico border is actually 2 1 to 2 2 miles east of the Texas line  The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819  It was then set along the 103rd Meridian  In the 1890s  when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques  it was discovered that the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian  Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819  and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2 2 miles to the east  It was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the original surveying error  The placement of the Oklahoma New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian   Cimarron County in Oklahoma s panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states  New Mexico  Texas  Colorado and Kansas  about two miles worth    2 1  Topography  Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed  generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary  Its highest and lowest points follow this trend  with its highest peak  Black Mesa  at 4 973 feet  1 516 m  above sea level  situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle  The state s lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel  OK  which dips to 289 feet  88 m  above sea level   Among the most geographically diverse states  Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions  with 11 in its borders – more per square mile than in any other state  Its western and eastern halves  however  are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity  Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three   Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges  the Ouachita Mountains  the Arbuckle Mountains  the Wichita Mountains  and the Ozark Mountains  Contained within the U S  Interior Highlands region  the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains mark the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians  A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north central Oklahoma  and near the state s eastern border  Cavanal Hill is regarded by the Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department as the world s tallest hill  at 1 999 feet  609 m   it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot   The semi arid high plains in the state s northwestern corner harbor few natural forests  the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains  Partial plains interrupted by small mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma  and transitional prairie and woodlands cover the central portion of the state  The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state s eastern third  gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction   More than 500 named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma s waterways  and with 200 lakes created by dams  it holds the highest number of artificial reservoirs in the nation  Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas rivers  though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins   2 2  Flora and fauna  Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass  mixed grass  and tallgrass prairie  harbor expansive ecosystems in the state s central and western portions  although cropland has largely replaced native grasses  Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state  shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems  though pinyon pines  red cedar  junipers   and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle   Marshlands  cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine  loblolly pine and deciduous forests dominate the state s southeastern quarter  while mixtures of largely post oak  elm  red cedar  Juniperus virginiana  and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma   The state holds populations of white tailed deer  mule deer  antelope  coyotes  mountain lions  bobcats  elk  and birds such as quail  doves  cardinals  bald eagles  red tailed hawks  and pheasants  In prairie ecosystems  American bison  greater prairie chickens  badgers  and armadillo are common  and some of the nation s largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state s panhandle  The Cross Timbers  a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma  harbors 351 vertebrate species  The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear  red fox  grey fox  and river otter populations  which coexist with a total of 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma  Also  in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator   2 3  Protected lands  Oklahoma has 50 state parks  six national parks or protected regions  two national protected forests or grasslands  and a network of wildlife preserves and conservation areas  Six percent of the state s 10 million acres  40 000 km2  of forest is public land  including the western portions of the Ouachita National Forest  the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States   With 39 000 acres  158 km2   the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north central Oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only 10 percent of its former land area  once covering 14 states  In addition  the Black Kettle National Grassland covers 31 300 acres  127 km2  of prairie in southwestern Oklahoma  The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest of nine national wildlife refuges in the state and was founded in 1901  encompassing 59 020 acres  238 8 km2    Of Oklahoma s federally protected park or recreational sites  the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest  with 9 898 63 acres  18 km2   Other sites include the Santa Fe and Trail of Tears national historic trails  the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites  and the Oklahoma City National Memorial   2 4  Climate  Oklahoma is located in a temperate region and experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation typical of a continental climate  Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold and warm air masses producing severe weather  An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world   Because of Oklahoma s position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds  weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time  As an example  on November 11  1911  the temperature at Oklahoma City reached in the afternoon  the record high for that date   then an incoming squall line resulted in a drop to at midnight  the record low for that date   thus  both the record high and record low for November 11 were set on the same date  This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area  such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak  when a warm front travelled along a stalled cold front  resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day   The humid subtropical climate  Koppen Cfa  of the eastern part of Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico  but transitions progressively to a semi arid zone  Koppen BSk  in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward  less frequently touched by southern moisture  Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly  with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62 °F  17 °C  and an annual rainfall of   while areas of the panhandle average 58 °F  14 °C   with an annual rainfall under    All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 °F  38 °C  or below 0 °F  −18 °C   and snowfall ranges from an average of less than in the south to just over on the border of Colorado in the panhandle  The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center  the National Severe Storms Laboratory  and the Warning Decision Training Branch  all part of the National Weather Service and located in Norman  Oklahoma s highest recorded temperature of was recorded at Tipton on June 27  1994 and the lowest recorded temperature of was recorded at Nowata on February 10  2011   3  History  Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early as the last ice age  Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma  The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region  The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds  in what is now Spiro  Oklahoma  which flourished between AD 850 and 1450  Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541  but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s and it remained under French rule until 1803  when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase   During the 19th century  thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present day Oklahoma  The Choctaw was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the southeastern United States  The phrase  Trail of Tears  originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831  although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal   A total of 17 000 Cherokees and 2 000 of their black slaves were deported  The area  already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes  was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans  By 1890  more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or  Indian Country    Many Native Americans served in the Union and Confederate military during the American Civil War  The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war  Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished until 1866   In the period between 1866 and 1899  cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner  Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory  In 1881  four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory   Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887  which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families  encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government  In the process  railroad companies took nearly half of Indian held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase   Major land runs  including the Land Run of 1889  were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time  Usually land was open to settlers on a first come first served basis  Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border sooner  leading to the term sooners  which eventually became the state s official nickname   Deliberations to make the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century  when the Curtis Act continued the allotment of Indian tribal land   3 1  20th century  Attempts to create an all Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention  which took place two years later  On November 16  1907  Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union   The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry  as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth  Tulsa eventually became known as the  Oil Capital of the World  for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state s early economy  In 1927  an Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery  known as the  Father of Route 66   began the campaign to create U S  Route 66  Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo  Texas to Tulsa  Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66  Avery spearheaded the creation of the U S  Highway 66 Association to oversee the planning of Route 66  based in his hometown of Tulsa   Oklahoma also has a rich African American history  There were many black towns that thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from neighboring states  especially Kansas  The politician Edward P  McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory  He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority black state   By the early 20th century  the Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States  Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century  but the blacks had created a thriving area   Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915  The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921  with whites attacking blacks  In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history  sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed  $1 8 million in property damage  and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people  By the late 1920s  the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state   During the 1930s  parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices  extended drought and high winds  Known as the Dust Bowl  areas of Kansas  Texas  New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures  sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States  Over a twenty year period ending in 1950  the state saw its only historical decline in population  dropping 6 9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl   Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams  they built hundreds of reservoirs and man made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation  By the 1960s  Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes  the most in the nation   In 1995  Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history  The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19  1995  in which Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols detonated an explosive outside of the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  killed 168 people  including 19 children  The two men were convicted of the bombing  McVeigh was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on June 11  2001  his partner Nichols is serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole  McVeigh s army buddy  Michael Fortier  was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $75 000 fine for his role in the bombing plot  i e  assisting in the sale of guns to raise funds for the bombing  and examining the Murrah Federal building as a possible target prior to the terrorist attack   His wife  Lori Fortier  who has since died  was granted immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony in the case   4  Demographics  The United States Census Bureau

Oklahoma is placed in the South by the United States Census Bureau  but lies fully or partially in the Southwest  and southern cultural regions by varying definitions  and partially in the Upland South and Great Plains by definitions of abstract geographical cultural regions  Oklahomans have a high rate of English  Scotch Irish  German  and Native American ancestry  with 25 different native languages spoken   Because many Native Americans were forced to move to Oklahoma when White settlement in North America increased  Oklahoma has much linguistic diversity  Mary Linn  an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma and the associate curator of Native American languages at the Sam Noble Museum  said that Oklahoma also has high levels of language endangerment   Six governments have claimed the area now known as Oklahoma at different times  and 67 Native American tribes are represented in Oklahoma  including 39 federally recognized tribes  who are headquartered and have tribal jurisdictional areas in the state  Western ranchers  Native American tribes  southern settlers  and eastern oil barons have shaped the state s cultural predisposition  and its largest cities have been named among the most underrated cultural destinations in the United States   While residents of Oklahoma are associated with stereotypical traits of southern hospitality – the 2006 Catalogue for Philanthropy  with data from 2004  ranks Oklahomans 7th in the nation for overall generosity – the state has also been associated with a negative cultural stereotype first popularized by John Steinbeck s novel  The Grapes of Wrath   which described the plight of uneducated  poverty stricken Dust Bowl era farmers deemed  Okies   However  the term is often used in a positive manner by Oklahomans   6 1  Arts and theater  In the state s largest urban areas  pockets of jazz culture flourish  and Native American  Mexican American  and Asian American
