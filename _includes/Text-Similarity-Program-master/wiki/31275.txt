The Age of Reason  Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is an influential work written by English and American political activist Thomas Paine  It follows in the tradition of eighteenth century British deism  and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible  the central Christian text   Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets  it was published in three parts in 1794  1795  and 1807  It was a best seller in the United States  where it caused a short lived deistic revival  British audiences  however  fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution  received it with more hostility  The Age of Reason presents common deistic arguments  for example  it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power  Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation  leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as  an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text   It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator God   Most of Paine s arguments had long been available to the educated elite  but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style  he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience  The book was also inexpensive  putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers  Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas  the British government prosecuted printers and book sellers who tried to publish and distribute it  Nevertheless  Paine s work inspired and guided many free thinkers   1  Historical context  1 1  Intellectual context  eighteenth century British deism  Paine s book followed in the tradition of early eighteenth century British deism  These deists  while maintaining individual positions  still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in The Age of Reason  The most important position that united the early deists was their call for  free rational inquiry  into all subjects  especially religion  Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience  they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution  They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality  Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview  and they believed all things in the universe  even God  must obey the laws of nature  Without a concept of natural law  the deists argued  explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality  This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles  Because miracles had to be observed to be validated  deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God s miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God  Along these lines  deistic writings insisted that God  as the first cause or prime mover  had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan  They hold that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to  miraculously  intervene in human affairs  Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious Truth or  one true faith   religion could only be  simple  apparent  ordinary  and universal  if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God  They therefore distinguished between  revealed religions   which they rejected   such as Christianity  and  natural religion   a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God s existence  they were  thus  not atheists    While some deists accepted revelation  most argued that revelation s restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power  Moreover  many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable  According to these writers  revelation could reinforce the evidence for God s existence already apparent in the natural world  but more often it led to superstition among the masses  Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles  unnecessary rituals  and illogical and dangerous doctrines  these accusations were typically referred to as  priestcraft    The worst of these doctrines was original sin  By convincing people that they required a priest s help to overcome their innate sinfulness  deists argued  religious leaders had enslaved the human population  Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators   1 2  Political context  French revolution  By the time Part I of The Age of Reason was published in 1794  many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution  The Reign of Terror had begun  Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France  Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen  The Age of Reason belongs to this later  more radical stage of the British political reform movement  one that openly embraced republicanism and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as William Godwin s Political Justice  1793   By the middle of the decade  the moderate voices had disappeared  Richard Price  the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke s Reflections on the Revolution in France  1790   had died in 1791  and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church   The conservative government  headed by William Pitt  responded to this increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for seditious libel and treason in the famous 1794 Treason Trials  Following the trials and an attack on George III  conservatives were successful in passing the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act  also known as the  Two Acts  or the  gagging acts    These acts prohibited freedom of assembly for groups such as the radical London Corresponding Society  LCS  and encouraged indictments against radicals for  libelous and seditious  statements  Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French revolution  many reformers drifted away from the cause  The LCS  which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers  fractured when Francis Place and other leaders helped Paine publish The Age of Reason  the society s more religious members withdrew in protest and the LCS lost around one fifth of its membership   2  Publishing history  In December 1792  Paine s Rights of Man  part II was declared seditious in Britain and he was forced to flee to France in order to avoid arrest  Dismayed by the French revolution s turn toward secularism and atheism  he composed Part I of The Age of Reason in 1792 and 1793  Although Paine wrote The Age of Reason for the French  he dedicated it to his  Fellow Citizens of the United States of America   alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries   It is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he says in the preface to Part II  According to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick  he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793  but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793  It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793  François Lanthenas  who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794  wrote that it was first published in France in 1793  but no book fitting his description has been positively identified  Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason  Part I in 1794 in London  selling it for a mere three pence   Meanwhile  Paine  considered too moderate by the powerful Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries  was imprisoned for ten months in France  He only escaped the guillotine by accident  the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door  When James Monroe  at that time the new American Minister to France  secured his release in 1794  Paine immediately began work on Part II of The Age of Reason  despite his poor health  Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H D  Symonds in London in October 1795  In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II  and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence   Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works   Paine himself financed the shipping of 15 000 copies of his work to America  Later  Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2 000 copies  Williams also produced his own edition  but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets   In the late 1790s  Paine fled from France to the United States  where he wrote Part III of The Age of Reason  An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament  Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ  Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals  Thomas Jefferson convinced him not to publish it in 1802  five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue   Following Thomas Williams s sentence of one year s hard labor for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797  no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included it in an edition of Paine s complete works  Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work  and the first run of 1 000 copies sold out in a month  He immediately published a second edition of 3 000 copies  Like Williams  he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel  The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers   3  Structure and major arguments  The Age of Reason is divided into three sections  In Part I  Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed  In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God   3 1  Analysis  At the beginning of Part I of the Age of Reason  Paine lays out his personal belief  Paine s creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text  a firm belief in a creator God  a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims  here the afterlife  later in the text  miracles   a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself  an animus against corrupt religious institutions  and an emphasis on the individual s right of conscience   3 2  Reason and revelation  Paine begins The Age of Reason by attacking revelation  Revelation  he maintains  can only be verified by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God s existence  Paine rejects prophecies and miracles  writing   it is revelation to the first person only  and hearsay to every other  and consequently they are not obliged to believe it   He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances  Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation  Paine argues that the only reliable  unchanging and universal evidence of God s existence is the natural world   The Bible of the Deist   he contends  should not be a human invention such as the Bible  but rather a divine invention—it should be  creation   Paine takes this argument even further  maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible  In Part II of The Age of Reason  he will do just this  pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible  For example Thomas Paine notes    The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles  related in the New Testament  is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ  and carrying him to the top of a high mountain  and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple  and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World  How happened it that he did not discover America  or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest     3 2 1  Paine s analysis of the Bible  After establishing that he would refrain from using extra Biblical sources to inform his criticism  but would instead apply the Bible s own words against itself  Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible  analyzing it as one would any other book  For example  in his analysis of the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are  inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards  and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin   Describing the Bible as  fabulous mythology   Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known  he dismisses the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch  for example    Using methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century  Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency and questioned its historical accuracy  concluding that it was not divinely inspired   Paine also argues that the Old Testament must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God  The  history of wickedness  pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human authored myths  He deplores people s credulity   Brought up in habits of superstition   he wrote   people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God   Citing Numbers 31 13–47 as an example  in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women  and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls  at God s behest  Paine calls the Bible a  book of lies  wickedness  and blasphemy  for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty    3 3  Religion and the state  Paine also attacks religious institutions  indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church s opposition to scientific investigation  He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression  Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the Rights of Man and Common Sense  stating that  the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists  accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue   This kind of attack distinguishes Paine s book from other deistic works  which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies  He argues that the Church and the State are a single corrupt institution which does not act in the best interests of the people—both must be radically altered  As Jon Mee  a scholar of British radicalism  writes   Paine believed       a revolution in religion was the natural corollary  even prerequisite  of a fully successful political revolution   Paine lays out a vision of  in Davidson and Scheick s words   an age of intellectual freedom  when reason would triumph over superstition  when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship  which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions   It is this vision that scholars have called Paine s  secular millennialism  and it appears in all of his works—he ends the Rights of Man  for example  with the statement   From what we now see  nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable  It is an age of revolutions  in which everything may be looked for   Paine  transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia   emphasizing the possibilities of  progress  and  human perfectibility  that could be achieved by humankind  without God s aid   3 4  Paine s intellectual debts  Although Paine liked to say that he read very little  his writings belie this statement  The Age of Reason has intellectual roots in the traditions of David Hume  Spinoza  and Voltaire  Since Hume had already made many of the same  moral attacks upon Christianity  that Paine popularized in The Age of Reason  scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume s works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle  Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume s description of religion as  a positive source of harm to society  that  led men to be factious  ambitious and intolerant   More of an influence on Paine than Hume  however  was Spinoza s Tractatus Theologico politicus  1678   Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza s ideas through the works of other eighteenth century deists  most notably Conyers Middleton  Paine would also more than likely have been familiar with Voltaire s mocking wit and the works of other deistic French philosophes   Though these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on The Age of Reason  Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the English deists of the early eighteenth century  such as Peter Annet  John Toland had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture  Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation  Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles  Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament  Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality  All of these arguments appear in The Age of Reason  albeit less coherently   4  Rhetoric and style  The most distinctive feature of The Age of Reason  like all of Paine s works  is its linguistic style  Historian Eric Foner argues that Paine s works  forged a new political language  designed to bring politics to the people  using a  clear  simple and straightforward  style  Paine outlined  a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society  and his language reflected these ideals  He originated such phrases as  the rights of man    the age of reason    the age of revolution   and  the times that try men s souls   Foner also maintains that with The Age of Reason Paine  gave deism a new  aggressive  explicitly anti Christian tone   He did this by employing  vulgar   that is   low  or  popular   language  an irreverent tone  and even religious rhetoric   In a letter to Elihu Palmer  one of his most loyal followers in America  Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy  Paine s rhetoric had broad appeal  his  pithy  lines were  able to bridge working class and middle class cultures  and become common quotations   Part of what makes Paine s style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to the profusion of  anecdote  irony  parody  satire  feigned confusion  folk matter  concrete vocabulary  and       appeals to common sense   Paine s conversational style draws the reader into the text  His use of  we  conveys an  illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument   By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half formed  Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently   4 1   Vulgar  language  The most distinctive element of Paine s style in The Age of Reason is its  vulgarity   In the eighteenth century  vulgarity  was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity  thus  when Paine celebrates his  vulgar  style and his critics attack it  the dispute is over class accessibility  not profanity  For example  Paine describes the Fall this way  The irreverent tone that Paine combined with this vulgar style set his work apart from its predecessors  It took  deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and  brought  it to the people    Paine s rhetorical appeal to  the people  attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible  Bishop Richard Watson  forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine  An Apology for the Bible  writes   I shall  designedly  write this and the following letters in a popular manner  hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers  for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated  and who are the most likely to be injured by it   But it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others  it was also the cheapness of Paine s book  At one sedition trial in the early 1790s  the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke s Reflections on the Revolution in France  arguing that  although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes  yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people   Similar concerns drove the prosecution of those who printed  published  and distributed The Age of Reason   4 2  Irreverent tone  Paine s style is not only  vulgar   it is also irreverent  For example  he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis   The story of Eve and the serpent  and of Noah and his ark  drops to a level with the Arabian tales  without the merit of being entertaining   Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity  theirs was a refined wit rather than the broad humor Paine employed  It was the early Deists of the middling ranks  and not the educated elite  who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous   It was Paine s  ridiculing  tone that most angered Churchmen  As John Redwood  a scholar of deism  puts it   the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule  for it was ridicule  not reason  that endangered the Church   Significantly  Watson s Apology directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone   4 3  Religious influences  Paine s Quaker upbringing predisposed him to deistic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent  Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism  but the Quakers  esteem for plain speaking  a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason  influenced his writing even more  As the historian E  P  Thompson has put it  Paine  ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand   His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language  it is  an account of a young woman engaged to be married  and while under this engagement she is  to speak plain language  debauched by a ghost   Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason  Davidson and Scheick argue that its  introductory statement of purpose  a fervid sense of inward inspiration  a declared expression of conscience  and an evangelical intention to instruct others  resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers   Paine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in The Age of Reason  most importantly a millennial language that appealed to his lower class readers  Claiming that true religious language is universal  Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself  The sermonic quality of Paine s writing is one of its most recognizable traits  Sacvan Bercovitch  a scholar of the sermon  argues that Paine s writing often resembles that of the jeremiad or  political sermon   He contends that Paine draws on the Puritan tradition in which  theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God   One reason Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a Methodist preacher  although this suspicion cannot be verified   5  Reception and legacy  The Age of Reason provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics  although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality  There were four major factors for this animosity  Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred  inspired text  he argued that Christianity was a human invention  his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power  and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers   5 1  Britain  Paine s Age of Reason sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war  Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812  Many of these responded specifically to Paine s attack on the Bible in Part II  when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II  it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I   Although critics responded to Paine s analysis of the Bible  they did not usually address his specific arguments  Instead  they advocated a literal reading of the Bible  citing the Bible s long history as evidence of its authority  They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine  describing him  as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent  enlightened people   Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of Man turned away from those presented in The Age of Reason  Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine s claims and distanced itself from the book  Paine s deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism   Despite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to The Age of Reason  some scholars have argued that Constantin Volney s deistic The Ruins  translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as Thomas Spence s Pig s Meat and Daniel Isaac Eaton s Politics for the People  was actually more influential than The Age of Reason  According to David Bindman  The Ruins  achieved a popularity in England comparable to Rights of Man itself   However  one minister complained that  the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication  as The Age of Reason  was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments   other popular reform causes    It was not until Richard Carlile s 1818 trial for publishing The Age of Reason that Paine s text became  the anti Bible of all lower class nineteenth century infidel agitators   Although the book had been selling well before the trial  once Carlile was arrested and charged  4 000 copies were sold in just a few months  At the trial itself  which created a media frenzy  Carlile read the entirety of The Age of Reason into the court record  ensuring it an even wider publication  Between 1818 and 1822  Carlile claimed to have  sent into circulation near 20 000 copies of the Age of Reason   Just as in the 1790s  it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818  As Joss Marsh  in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century  points out   at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself  abusive  and  outrageous   The Age of Reason struggle almost tolled the hour when the words  plain    coarse    common   and  vulgar  took on a pejorative meaning   Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison  but spent six years instead because he refused any  legal conditions  on his release   Paine s new rhetoric came to dominate popular nineteenth century radical journalism  particularly that of freethinkers  Chartists and Owenites  Its legacy can be seen in Thomas Wooler s radical periodical The Black Dwarf  Richard Carlile s numerous newspapers and journals  the radical works of William Cobbett  Henry Hetherington s periodicals the Penny Papers and the Poor Man s Guardian  the works of the Chartist William Lovett  George Holyoake s newspapers and books on Owenism  and freethinker Charles Bradlaugh s New Reformer  A century after the publication of The Age of Reason  Paine s rhetoric was still being used  George Foote s  Bible Handbook  1888        systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out  Contradictions    Absurdities    Atrocities   and  Obscenities   exactly in the manner of Paine s Age of Reason   The periodical The Freethinker  founded in 1881 by George Foote  argued  like Paine  that the  absurdities of faith  could be  slain with laughter   In Britain  it was this freethinking tradition that continued Paine s legacy   5 2  France  The Age of Reason  despite having been written for the French  made very little  if any  impact on revolutionary France  Paine wrote that  the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language  to stop them in that career  and fix them to the first article       of every man s creed who has any creed at all – I believe in God   emphasis Paine s   Paine s arguments were already common and accessible in France  they had  in a sense  already been rejected   While still in France  Paine formed the Church of Theophilanthropy with five other families  this civil religion held as its central dogma that man should worship God s wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible  The church had no priest or minister  and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers  It celebrated four festivals honoring St  Vincent de Paul  George Washington  Socrates  and Rousseau  Samuel Adams articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed  to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy   The church closed  however  in 1801  when Napoleon concluded a concordat with the Vatican   5 3  United States  In the United States  The Age of Reason initially caused a deistic  revival   but was then viciously attacked and soon forgotten  Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a  filthy little atheist  by Theodore Roosevelt over one hundred years later   At the end of the eighteenth century  America was ripe for Paine s arguments  Ethan Allen published the first American defense of deism  the Oracles of Reason  1784   but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite  Men such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson espoused its tenets  while at the same time arguing that religion served the useful purpose of  social control   It was not until the publication of Paine s more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America  The public was receptive  in part  because they approved of the secular ideals of the French Revolution  The Age of Reason went through seventeen editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States  Elihu Palmer   a blind renegade minister  and Paine s most loyal follower in America  promoted deism throughout the country  Palmer published what became  the bible of American deism   The Principles of Nature  established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia  built Temples of Reason throughout the nation  and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays  Foner writes that  The Age of Reason became the most popular deist work ever written        Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist  now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable   Paine presented deism to the masses and  as in Britain  educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many  Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed   Almost immediately after this deistic upsurge  the Second Great Awakening began  George Spater explains that  the revulsion felt for Paine s Age of Reason and for other anti religious thought was so great that a major counter revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century   By 1796 every student at Harvard was given a copy of Bishop Watson s rebuttal of The Age of Reason  In 1815  Parson Weems  an early American novelist and moralist  published God s Revenge Against Adultery  in which one of the major characters  owed his early downfall to reading  PAINE S AGE OF REASON    Paine s  libertine  text leads the young man to  bold slanders of the bible   even to the point that he  threw aside his father s good old family bible  and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON    Paine could not publish part III of The Age of Reason in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him  Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the American Revolution  Paine was now lambasted in the press and called  the scavenger of faction   a  lilly livered sinical rogue   a  loathsome reptile   a  demi human archbeast    an object of disgust  of abhorrence  of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States  Thomas Jefferson    In October 1805 John Adams wrote to his friend Benjamin Waterhouse  an American physician and scientist  Adams viewed Paine s Age of Reason not as the embodiment of the Enlightenment but as a  betrayal  of it  Despite all of these attacks  Paine never wavered in his beliefs  when he was dying  a woman came to visit him  claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul  Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in The Age of Reason   pooh  pooh  it is not true  You were not sent with any such impertinent message        Pshaw  He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message    The Age of Reason was largely ignored after 1820  except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America  among them Robert G  Ingersoll and the American abolitionist Moncure Daniel Conway  who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine  favorably reviewed by The New York Times  Not until the publication of Charles Darwin s The Origin of Species in 1859  and the large scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain  did many of Paine s ideas take hold  As writer Mark Twain said   It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the Age of Reason   I read it first when I was a cub pilot  read it with fear and hesitation  but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power   Paine s criticisms of the church  the monarchy  and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court  1889    Paine s text is still published today  one of the few eighteenth century religious texts to be widely available  Its message still resonates  evidenced by Christopher Hitchens s statement that  if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time  we shall require an age of reason   His 2006 book on the Rights of Man ends with the claim that  in a time       when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack  the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend    6  Notes  7  Bibliography  Bindman  David     Reflections of Revolution  Images of Romanticism  Ed  Alison Yarrington and Kelvin Everest  London  Routledge  1993  ISBN 0 415 07741 9   Claeys
