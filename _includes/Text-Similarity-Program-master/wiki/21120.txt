A neuron   or   also known as a neurone or nerve cell  is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals  These signals between neurons occur via synapses  specialized connections with other cells  Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks  Neurons are the core components of the nervous system  which includes the brain  spinal cord–which together comprise the central nervous system  CNS –and the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system  PNS    Specialized types of neurons include  sensory neurons which respond to touch  sound  light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain  motor neurons that receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to cause muscle contractions and affect glandular outputs  and interneurons which connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord in neural networks   A typical neuron possesses a cell body  soma   dendrites  and an axon  The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon  particularly in its undifferentiated stage  Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body  often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times  giving rise to a complex  dendritic tree   An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance  as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species  The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites  but never to more than one axon  although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates  At the majority of synapses  signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another  There are  however  many exceptions to these rules  neurons that lack dendrites  neurons that have no axon  synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite  etc   All neurons are electrically excitable  maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps  which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular versus extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium  potassium  chloride  and calcium  Changes in the cross membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage dependent ion channels  If the voltage changes by a large enough amount  an all or none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated  which travels rapidly along the cell s axon  and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives   Neurons do not undergo cell division  In most cases  neurons are generated by special types of stem cells  A type of glial cell  called astrocytes  named for being somewhat star shaped   have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency  In humans  neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas  the hippocampus and olfactory bulb  there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons   1  Overview  A neuron is a specialized type of cell found in the bodies of all eumetozoans  Only sponges and a few other simpler animals lack neurons  The features that define a neuron are electrical excitability and the presence of synapses  which are complex membrane junctions that transmit signals to other cells  The body s neurons  plus the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support  together constitute the nervous system  In vertebrates  the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system  but some reside in peripheral ganglia  and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea   Although neurons are very diverse and there are exceptions to nearly every rule  it is convenient to begin with a schematic description of the structure and function of a  typical  neuron  A typical neuron is divided into three parts  the soma or cell body  dendrites  and axon  The soma is usually compact  the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it  Dendrites typically branch profusely  getting thinner with each branching  and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma  The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock  and can extend for great distances  giving rise to hundreds of branches  Unlike dendrites  an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends  The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites  but never to more than one axon  Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites  signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon  A typical synapse  then  is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another  Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory  If the net excitation received by a neuron over a short period of time is large enough  the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential  which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon  activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes  This is called saltatory conduction   Many neurons fit the foregoing schema in every respect  but there are also exceptions to most parts of it  There are no neurons that lack a soma  but there are neurons that lack dendrites  and others that lack an axon  Furthermore  in addition to the typical axodendritic and axosomatic synapses  there are axoaxonic  axon to axon  and dendrodendritic  dendrite to dendrite  synapses   The key to neural function is the synaptic signaling process  which is partly electrical and partly chemical  The electrical aspect depends on properties of the neuron s membrane  Like all animal cells  the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane  a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it  A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator  but in neurons  many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active  These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane  and ion pumps that actively transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other  Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions  Some ion channels are voltage gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane  Others are chemically gated  meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid  The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane  typically a bit less than 1 10 of a volt at baseline  This voltage has two functions  first  it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane  second  it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane   Neurons communicate by chemical and electrical synapses in a process known as neurotransmission  also called synaptic transmission  The fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential  a propagating electrical signal that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron  This is also known as a wave of depolarization   2  Anatomy and histology  Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals  Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system  there is  as expected  a wide variety in their shape  size  and electrochemical properties  For instance  the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter   The soma is the body of the neuron  As it contains the nucleus  most protein synthesis occurs here  The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter   The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches  This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree  This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine   The axon is a finer  cable like projection that can extend tens  hundreds  or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length  The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma  and also carries some types of information back to it   Many neurons have only one axon  but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching  enabling communication with many target cells  The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock  Besides being an anatomical structure  the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage dependent sodium channels  This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon  in electrophysiological terms it has the most negative action potential threshold  While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow  this region can also receive input from other neurons   The axon terminal contains synapses  specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons  Although the canonical view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components  dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so called main function   Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick  while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker  The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains  The longest axon of a human motoneuron can be over a meter long  reaching from the base of the spine to the toes  Sensory neurons have axons that run from the toes to the dorsal columns  over 1 5 meters in adults  Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks  Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon  an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size  0 5–1 millimeters thick  several centimeters long    Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic  however  recent research shows that additional neurons throughout the brain can originate from neural stem cells found throughout the brain but in particularly high concentrations in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone through the process of neurogenesis   2 1  Histology and internal structure  Nerve cell bodies stained with basophilic dyes show numerous microscopic clumps of Nissl substance  named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl  1860–1919   which consists of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA  The prominence of the Nissl substance can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are metabolically very active  and hence are involved in large amounts of protein synthesis   The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments  which are assembled into larger neurofibrils  Some neurons also contain pigment granules  such as neuromelanin  a brownish black pigment  byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines  and lipofuscin  yellowish brown pigment that accumulates with age    There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites  Typical axons almost never contain ribosomes  except some in the initial segment  Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes  with diminishing amounts with distance from the cell body   3  Classification  Neurons exist in a number of different shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function  The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types  type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons  which can often be confused with dendrites  Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located  The basic morphology of type I neurons  represented by spinal motor neurons  consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath  Around the cell body is a branching dendritic tree that receives signals from other neurons  The end of the axon has branching terminals  axon terminal  that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron   3 1  Structural classification  3 1 1  Polarity  Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as   Unipolar or pseudounipolar  dendrite and axon emerging from same process   Bipolar  axon and single dendrite on opposite ends of the soma   Multipolar  two or more dendrites  separate from the axon   Golgi I  neurons with long projecting axonal processes  examples are pyramidal cells  Purkinje cells  and anterior horn cells   Golgi II  neurons whose axonal process projects locally  the best example is the granule cell   Anaxonic  where axon cannot be distinguished from dendrites   3 1 2  Other  Furthermore  some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape  Some examples are   Basket cells  interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells  found in the cortex and cerebellum   Betz cells  large motor neurons   Lugaro cells  interneurons of the cerebellum   Medium spiny neurons  most neurons in the corpus striatum   Purkinje cells  huge neurons in the cerebellum  a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron   Pyramidal cells  neurons with triangular soma  a type of Golgi I   Renshaw cells  neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons   Unipolar brush cells  interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush like tuft   Granule cells  a type of Golgi II neuron   Anterior horn cells  motoneurons located in the spinal cord   Spindle cells  interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain  3 2  Functional classification  3 2 1  Direction  Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are sometimes also called sensory neurons   Efferent neurons transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells and are sometimes called motor neurons   Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system  Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that  respectively  bring information to or send information from the brain region   3 2 2  Action on other neurons  A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors  The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter  but by the type of receptor that is activated  A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key  and a receptor as a lock  the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks  Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory  causing an increase in firing rate   inhibitory  causing a decrease in firing rate   or modulatory  causing long lasting effects not directly related to firing rate    The two most common neurotransmitters in the brain  glutamate and GABA  have actions that are largely consistent  Glutamate acts on several different types of receptors  and have effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors  Similarly GABA acts on several different types of receptors  but all of them have effects  in adult animals  at least  that are inhibitory  Because of this consistency  it is common for neuroscientists to simplify the terminology by referring to cells that release glutamate as  excitatory neurons   and cells that release GABA as  inhibitory neurons   Since over 90% of the neurons in the brain release either glutamate or GABA  these labels encompass the great majority of neurons  There are also other types of neurons that have consistent effects on their targets  for example  excitatory  motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine  and  inhibitory  spinal neurons that release glycine   The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute  however  Rather  it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron  In principle  a single neuron  releasing a single neurotransmitter  can have excitatory effects on some targets  inhibitory effects on others  and modulatory effects on others still  For example  photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light  So called OFF bipolar cells are  like most neurons  excited by the released glutamate  However  neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate  because they lack the typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors  When light is present  the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate  which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition  activating them  this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells  silencing them   It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron  based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses  Parvalbumin expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex  whereas somatostatin expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron   3 2 3  Discharge patterns  Neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics   Tonic or regular spiking  Some neurons are typically constantly  or tonically  active  Example  interneurons in neurostriatum   Phasic or bursting  Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic   Fast spiking  Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates  for example some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons  cells in globus pallidus  retinal ganglion cells   3 2 4  Classification by neurotransmitter production  Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine  Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft  It acts as a ligand for both ligand gated ion channels and metabotropic  GPCRs  muscarinic receptors  Nicotinic receptors  are pentameric ligand gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine  Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release  Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A   GABAergic neurons—gamma aminobutyric acid  GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the CNS  the other being Glycine  GABA has a homologous function to ACh  gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron  Cl− causes hyperpolarization within the neuron  decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative  recall that for an action potential to fire  a positive voltage threshold must be reached   GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase   Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate  Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter  the other being Aspartate  Glutamate receptors are one of four categories  three of which are ligand gated ion channels and one of which is a G protein coupled receptor  often referred to as GPCR    Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type  D1 and D5  Gs coupled receptors  which increase cAMP and PKA  and D2 type  D2  D3  and D4  receptors  which activate Gi coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA  Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior  and modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission  Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson s disease  Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine  Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa  or L DOPA  by tyrosine hydroxlase  and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by amino acid decarboxylase   Serotonergic neurons—serotonin  Serotonin  5 Hydroxytryptamine  5 HT  can act as excitatory or inhibitory  Of the four 5 HT receptor classes  3 are GPCR and 1 is ligand gated cation channel  Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase  and then further by aromatic acid decarboxylase  A lack of 5 HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression  Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment  such as Prozac and Zoloft   4  Connectivity  Neurons communicate with one another via synapses  where the axon terminal or en passant boutons  terminals located along the length of the axon  of one cell impinges upon another neuron s dendrite  soma or  less commonly  axon  Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches  making connections with tens of thousands of other cells  other neurons  such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus  have only one or two dendrites  each of which receives thousands of synapses  Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory and either increase or decrease activity in the target neuron  Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses  which are direct  electrically conductive junctions between cells   In a chemical synapse  the process of synaptic transmission is as follows  when an action potential reaches the axon terminal  it opens voltage gated calcium channels  allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal  Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane  releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft  The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron  High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal also triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake  which  in turn  activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission   The human brain has a huge number of synapses  Each of the 1011  one hundred billion  neurons has on average 7 000 synaptic connections to other neurons  It has been estimated that the brain of a three year old child has about 1015 synapses  1 quadrillion   This number declines with age  stabilizing by adulthood  Estimates vary for an adult  ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses  100 to 500 trillion    5  Mechanisms for propagating action potentials  In 1937  John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties  Being larger than but similar in nature to human neurons  squid cells were easier to study  By inserting electrodes into the giant squid axons  accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential   The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal  an action potential   These signals are generated and propagated by charge carrying ions including sodium  Na+   potassium  K+   chloride  Cl−   and calcium  Ca2+    There are several stimuli that can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity  including pressure  stretch  chemical transmitters  and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane  Stimuli cause specific ion channels within the cell membrane to open  leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane  changing the membrane potential   Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials  but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly  To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction  many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons  The sheaths are formed by glial cells  oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system  The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter  whilst using less energy  The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1 mm long  punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier  which contain a high density of voltage gated ion channels  Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system   Some neurons do not generate action potentials  but instead generate a graded electrical signal  which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release  Such nonspiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons  because they cannot carry signals long distances   6  Neural coding  Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons  The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses  and the relationships amongst the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble  It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information   7  All or none principle  The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all or none response  In other words  if a neuron responds at all  then it must respond completely  Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing  There are different types of receptor response to stimulus  slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing  These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency  usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second  This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where to get greater intensity of a specific frequency  color  there have to be more photons  as the photons can t become  stronger  for a specific frequency   There are a number of other receptor types that are called quickly adapting or phasic receptors  where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus  examples include  skin when touched by an object causes the neurons to fire  but if the object maintains even pressure against the skin  the neurons stop firing  The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function   The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure  It has concentric layers like an onion  which form around the axon terminal  When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed  mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon  which fires  If the pressure is steady  there is no more stimulus  thus  typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed  which causes the corpuscle to change shape again  Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons   8  History  The term neuron was coined by the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer  The neuron s place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the early 20th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal  Ramón y Cajal proposed that neurons were discrete cells that communicated with each other via specialized junctions  or spaces  between cells  This became known as the neuron doctrine  one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience  To observe the structure of individual neurons  Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process known as Golgi s method  which had been developed by his rival  Camillo Golgi  Cajal s improvement  which involved a technique he called  double impregnation   is still in use  The silver impregnation stains are an extremely useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because  for reasons unknown  it stains a very small percentage of cells in a tissue  so one is able to see the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells in the densely packed brain   8 1  Neuron doctrine  The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system  The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century  It held that neurons are discrete cells  not connected in a meshwork   acting as metabolically distinct units   Later discoveries yielded a few refinements to the simplest form of the doctrine  For example  glial cells  which are not considered neurons  play an essential role in information processing  Also  electrical synapses are more common than previously thought  meaning that there are direct  cytoplasmic connections between neurons  In fact  there are examples of neurons forming even tighter coupling  the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons   Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization  which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them  as action potentials  along the axon in one direction  away from the cell body  The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions  dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons and axons can receive synaptic inputs   9  Neurons in the brain  The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species  One estimate  published in 1988  puts the human brain at about 100 billion  1011  neurons and 100 trillion  1014  synapses  A lower estimate  published in 2009  is 86 billion neurons  of which 16 3 billion are in the cerebral cortex  and 69 billion in the cerebellum  By contrast  the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons  making it an ideal experimental subject as scientists have been able to map all of the organism s neurons  The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster  a common subject in biological experiments  has around 100 000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors  Many properties of neurons  from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition  are maintained across species  allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems   10  Neurological disorders  Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease  CMT   also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy  HMSN   hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy and peroneal muscular atrophy  is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves  neuropathy  that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation  predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease  Presently incurable  this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders  with 37 in 100 000 affected   Alzheimer s disease  AD   also known simply as Alzheimer s  is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes  The most striking early symptom is loss of short term memory  amnesia   which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression  with relative preservation of older memories  As the disorder progresses  cognitive  intellectual  impairment extends to the domains of language  aphasia   skilled movements  apraxia   and recognition  agnosia   and functions such as decision making and planning become impaired   Parkinson s disease  PD   also known as Parkinson disease  is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer s motor skills and speech  Parkinson s disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders  It is characterized by muscle rigidity  tremor  a slowing of physical movement  bradykinesia   and in extreme cases  a loss of physical movement  akinesia   The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia  normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine  which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain  Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems  PD is both chronic and progressive   Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities  Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post synaptic neuromuscular junction  inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants  cholinesterase inhibitors and  in selected cases  thymectomy   10 1  Demyelination  Demyelination is the act of demyelinating  or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves  When myelin degrades  conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost  and the nerve eventually withers  This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy   10 2  Axonal degeneration  Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts  axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration  which is rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury  Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma  and eventually leads to bead like formation  Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation  Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury  Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate  The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases  caused by influx of calcium ion   suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process  Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation  The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the PNS  and longer in the CNS  The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently unknown   11  Nerve regeneration  It has been demonstrated that neurogenesis can sometimes occur in the adult vertebrate brain  a finding that led to controversy in 1999  However  more recent studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells  and the overwhelming majority of neurons comprising the neocortex were formed before birth and persist without replacement   It is often possible for peripheral axons to regrow if they are severed  Recent studies have also shown that the body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons  A report in Nature suggested that researchers had found a way to transform human skin cells into working nerve cells using a process called transdifferentiation in which  cells are forced to adopt new identities    12  Computational power  Historically it has been thought that neurons are relatively simple devices and that the immense computational power of the brain comes from having a great many of them  Indeed  artificial intelligence research has followed this line  However  it is now becoming increasingly apparent that even single neurons can perform complex computations   13  See also  Artificial neuron  Bidirectional cell  Biological neuron model
