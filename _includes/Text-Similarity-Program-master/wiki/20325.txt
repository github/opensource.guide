The Motorola 68060   sixty eight oh sixty   is a 32 bit microprocessor from Motorola released in 1994  It is the successor to the Motorola 68040 and is the highest performing member of the 68000 series  Two derivatives were produced  the 68LC060 and the 68EC060   1  Architecture  There is an LC  Low Cost  version  without an FPU and EC  Embedded Controller   without MMU and FPU  The 68060 design was led by Joe Circello   The 68060 shares most architectural features with the P5 Pentium  Both have a very similar superscalar in order dual instruction pipeline configuration  and an instruction decoder which breaks down complex instructions into simpler ones before execution  However  a significant difference is that the 68060 FPU is not pipelined and is therefore up to three times slower than the Pentium in floating point applications  In contrast to that  integer multiplications and bit shifting instructions are significantly faster on the 68060  An interesting feature of the 68060 is the ability to execute simple instructions in the address generation unit  AGU  and thereby supply the result two cycles before the ALU  Another point of interest is that large amounts of commercial compiled code were analyzed for clues as to which instructions would be the best candidates for performance optimization   Against the Pentium  the 68060 could perform better on mixed code  Pentium s decoder could not issue an FP instruction every opportunity and hence the FPU was not superscalar as the ALUs were  If the 68060 s non pipelined FPU could accept an instruction  it could be issued one by the decoder  This meant that optimizing for the 68060 was easier  no rules prevented FP instructions from being issued whenever was convenient for the programmer other than well understood instruction latencies  However  with properly optimized and scheduled code  the Pentium s FPU was capable of double the clock for clock throughput of the 68060 s FPU   The 68060 was the last development of the 680x0 series for general purpose use  abandoned in favor of the PowerPC chips  It saw use in some late model Amiga machines and Amiga accelerator cards as well as some Atari ST clones and a Falcon accelerator board  CT060   and very late models of the Alpha Microsystems multiuser computers before their migration to x86  but Apple Inc  and the Unix world had moved onto various RISC platforms by the time the  060 was available  The 68060 was introduced at 50 MHz on Motorola s 0 6 µm manufacturing process  A few years later it was shrunk to 0 42 µm and clock speed raised to 66 MHz and 75 MHz   Developments of the basic core continue  intended for embedded systems  Here they are combined with a number of peripheral interfaces to reduce the overall complexity and power requirements of a design  A number of chips  each with different sets of interfaces  are sold under the name ColdFire and DragonBall   2  History  Model numbers with even second to last digit  68000  68020  68040  68060  were reserved for major revisions to the 680x0 core architecture  Model numbers with odd second to last digit  68010  68030  68050  68070  were reserved for upgrades to the architecture of the previous chip  No 68050 or 68070 was ever produced by Motorola   For example  the Motorola 68010  and the obscure 68012  was a 68000 with improvements to the loop instruction and the ability to suspend then continue an instruction in the event of a page fault  enabling the use of virtual memory with the appropriate MMU hardware  There were  however  no major overhauls of the core architecture  Similarly  the Motorola 68030 was a process improvement on the 68020 with the MMU and a small data cache  256 bytes  moved on chip  The 68030 was available in speed ratings up to 50 MHz   The jump from the 68000 68010 to the 68020 68030  however  represented a major overhaul  with too many individual changes to list here   By the time the 68060 was in production  Motorola had abandoned development of the 680x0 type chips in favor of the PowerPC  The 68060 was the last 680x0 type processor from Motorola   There was a so called 68070 processor  produced by Signetics  Philips   and was a modestly improved 68000 series processor  with a simple  on chip MMU and I²C bus support  It came out long before the 68060  and was used mostly as an embedded processor in some consumer electronics items  most notably consoles for the CD i system   3  Usage  Perhaps its most memorable use was in American broadcast television graphics  Chyron s   Max   and Maxine  series of television character generators used the 68060 as the main processor  These character generators were a fixture on many American television networks  affiliate stations   In desktops  the 68060 was used in some variants of the Amiga 4000T produced by Amiga Technologies  and available as a third party upgrade for other Amiga models  It was also used in the Amiga clone DraCo non linear video system   The Q60 extended the Sinclair QL design similarly from the slowest start to the ultimate pace of the 68K architecture s capabilities  these 68060 based motherboards—at 66 MHz for the full 68060 or a non FPU 68LC060 option overclocked to 80 MHz—are more than 100 times faster than the Sinclair QL while running the same operating systems   The 68060 was also used in Nortel Meridian 1 Option 51  61 and 81 large office PBX systems  powering the CP3 and CP4 core processor boards  A pair of these boards each sporting a 68060 could be used to make the PBX fault tolerant  This was a logical application as previous Meridian 1 cores used other Motorola chips  Nortel has since changed the architecture to use Intel processors   Also the Motorola Vanguard 6560 multiprotocol router used a 50 MHz 68EC060 processor   Motorola MVME 17x and Force Computer SYS68K VMEbus systems also used a 68060 CPU   4  Variants  4 1  68EC060  The 68EC060 is a version of the Motorola 68060 microprocessor  intended for embedded controllers  EC   It differs from the 68060 in that it has neither an FPU nor an MMU  This makes it less expensive and it draws less power   4 2  68LC060  The 68LC060 is a low cost version of the Motorola 68060 microprocessor with no FPU  This makes it less expensive and it draws less power   4 3  Feature table  5  Technical data  ATC   Address Translation Cache  6  Notes  7  References  8
