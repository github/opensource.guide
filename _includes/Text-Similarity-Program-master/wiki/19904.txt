Meteorology is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere  Studies in the field stretch back millennia  though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century  The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after observing networks formed across several countries  It wasn t until after the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved   Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events which illuminate  and are explained by the science of meteorology  Those events are bound by the variables that exist in Earth s atmosphere  temperature  air pressure  water vapor  and the gradients and interactions of each variable  and how they change in time  Different spatial scales are studied to determine how systems on local  regional  and global levels impact weather and climatology   Meteorology  climatology  atmospheric physics  and atmospheric chemistry are sub disciplines of geography and the atmospheric sciences  Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology  Interactions between Earth s atmosphere and the oceans are part of coupled ocean atmosphere studies  Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military  energy production  transport  agriculture and construction   The word  meteorology  is from Greek metéōros  lofty  high  in the sky    from meta   above  and aeiro  I lift up   and  logia    o logy    1  History  The beginnings of meteorology can be traced back to ancient India  as the Upanishads contain serious discussion about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the seasonal cycles caused by the movement of earth around the sun  Varāhamihira s classical work Brihatsamhita  written about 500 AD  provides clear evidence that a deep knowledge of atmospheric processes existed even in those times   In 350 BC  Aristotle wrote Meteorology  Aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology  One of the most impressive achievements described in the Meteorology is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle  The Greek scientist Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting  called the Book of Signs  The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2 000 years  In 25 AD  Pomponius Mela  a geographer for the Roman Empire  formalized the climatic zone system  According to Toufic Fahd  around the 9th century  Al Dinawari wrote the Kitab al Nabat  Book of Plants   in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution  He describes the meteorological character of the sky  the planets and constellations  the sun and moon  the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain  the anwa  heavenly bodies of rain   and atmospheric phenomena such as winds  thunder  lightning  snow  floods  valleys  rivers  lakes   1 1  Research of visual atmospheric phenomena  Ptolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations  In 1021  Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight  he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon  and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the earth s atmosphere as 52 000 passuum  about 49 miles  or 79 km    St  Albert the Great was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere  and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop  Roger Bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow  He stated that the rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon  In the late 13th century and early 14th century  Kamāl al Dīn al Fārisī and Theodoric of Freiberg were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary rainbow phenomenon  Theoderic went further and also explained the secondary rainbow  In 1716  Edmund Halley suggested that aurorae are caused by  magnetic effluvia  moving along the Earth s magnetic field lines   1 2  Instruments and classification scales  In 1441  King Sejong s son  Prince Munjong  invented the first standardized rain gauge  These were sent throughout the Joseon Dynasty of Korea as an official tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer s potential harvest  In 1450  Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging plate anemometer  and was known as the first anemometer  In 1607  Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope  In 1611  Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals   Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula  A New Year s Gift of Hexagonal Snow    In 1643  Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer  In 1662  Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical  self emptying  tipping bucket rain gauge  In 1714  Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury type thermometer  In 1742  Anders Celsius  a Swedish astronomer  proposed the  centigrade  temperature scale  the predecessor of the current Celsius scale  In 1783  the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace Bénédict de Saussure  In 1802–1803  Luke Howard wrote On the Modification of Clouds in which he assigns cloud types Latin names  In 1806  Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds  Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published  including the International Cloud Atlas  which has remained in print ever since  The April 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite  TIROS 1  marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally   1 3  Atmospheric composition research  In 1648  Blaise Pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height  and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere  In 1738  Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamics  initiating the kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases  In 1761  Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting  In 1772  Black s student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen  which he called phlogisticated air  and together they developed the phlogiston theory  In 1777  Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion  In 1783  in Lavoisier s book Reflexions sur le phlogistique  he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory  In 1804  Sir John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface  suggesting the importance of black body radiation  In 1808  John Dalton defended caloric theory in A New System of Chemistry and described how it combines with matter  especially gases  he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight  In 1824  Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory  he developed the notion of a reversible process and  in postulating that no such thing exists in nature  laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics   1 4  Research into cyclones and air flow  In 1494  Christopher Columbus experienced a tropical cyclone  which led to the first written European account of a hurricane  In 1686  Edmund Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions  In 1735  an ideal explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley  In 1743  when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane  he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery  Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first  Gaspard Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts  such as waterwheels  In 1856  William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid latitudes  with air being deflected by the Coriolis force to create the prevailing westerly winds  Late in the 19th century  the full extent of the large scale interaction of pressure gradient force and deflecting force that in the end causes air masses to move along isobars was understood  By 1912  this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect  Just after World War I  a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation  intensification and ultimate decay  the life cycle  of mid latitude cyclones  introducing the idea of fronts  that is  sharply defined boundaries between air masses  The group included Carl Gustaf Rossby  who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics   Tor Bergeron  who first determined the mechanism by which rain forms  and Jacob Bjerknes   1 5  Observation networks and weather forecasting  In 1654  Ferdinando II de Medici established the first weather observing network  that consisted of meteorological stations in Florence  Cutigliano  Vallombrosa  Bologna  Parma  Milan  Innsbruck  Osnabrück  Paris and Warsaw  Collected data were centrally sent to Florence at regular time intervals  In 1832  an electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling  The arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded  for the first time  a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area  This data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the earth s surface and to study how these states evolved through time  To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations  but it was not until 1849 that the Smithsonian Institution began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of Joseph Henry  Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time  In 1854  the United Kingdom government appointed Robert FitzRoy to the new office of Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade with the role of gathering weather observations at sea  FitzRoy s office became the United Kingdom Meteorological Office in 1854  the first national meteorological service in the world  The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy s Office were published in The Times newspaper in 1860  The following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected   Over the next 50 years many countries established national meteorological services  The India Meteorological Department  1875  was established following tropical cyclone and monsoon related famines in the previous decades  The Finnish Meteorological Central Office  1881  was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of Helsinki University  Japan s Tokyo Meteorological Observatory  the forerunner of the Japan Meteorological Agency  began constructing surface weather maps in 1883  The United States Weather Bureau  1890  was established under the United States Department of Agriculture  The Australian Bureau of Meteorology  1906  was established by a Meteorology Act to unify existing state meteorological services   1 6  Numerical weather prediction  In 1904  Norwegian scientist Vilhelm Bjerknes first argued in his paper Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws   It was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction  In 1922  Lewis Fry Richardson published  Weather Prediction By Numerical Process   after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I  He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected  and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised  to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found  Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others  However  the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers  and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems  It was later found  through numerical analysis  that this was due to numerical instability   Starting in the 1950s  numerical forecasts with computers became feasible  The first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic  single vertical level  models  and could successfully predict the large scale movement of midlatitude Rossby waves  that is  the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs   In the 1960s  the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz  founding the field of chaos theory  These advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers  to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere  Climate models have been developed that feature a resolution comparable to older weather prediction models  These climate models are used to investigate long term climate shifts  such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases   2  Meteorologists  Meteorologists are scientists who study meteorology  The American Meteorological Society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic   Meteorologists work in government agencies  private consulting and research services  industrial enterprises  utilities  radio and television stations  and in education  In the United States  meteorologists held about 9 400 jobs in 2009   Meteorologists are best known for forecasting the weather  Many radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists  while others are reporters  weather specialist  weatherman  etc   with no formal meteorological training  The American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association issue  Seals of Approval  to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements   3  Equipment  Each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment  In the atmosphere  there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured  Rain  which can be observed  or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first ones to be measured historically  Also  two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity  Neither of these can be seen but can be felt  The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid 15th century and were respectively the rain gauge  the anemometer  and the hygrometer  Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables  Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable  Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work  as the difficulty to measure the air   Sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists  They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station  a ship or a weather buoy  The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables  Usually  temperature  pressure  wind measurements  and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer  barometer  anemometer  and hygrometer  respectively  Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting  The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes  Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization   Remote sensing  as used in meteorology  is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information  The common types of remote sensing are Radar  Lidar  and satellites  or photogrammetry   Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and  usually  stores the data where the instrument is located  Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use EM radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere  Weather satellites along with more general purpose Earth observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Niño   4  Spatial scales  In the study of the atmosphere  meteorology can be divided into distinct areas of emphasis depending on the temporal scope and spatial scope of interest  At one extreme of this scale is climatology  In the timescales of hours to days  meteorology separates into micro   meso   and synoptic scale meteorology  Respectively  the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale   Other subclassifications are available based on the need by or by the unique  local or broad effects that are studied within that sub class   4 1  Microscale  Microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena of about 1 km or less  Individual thunderstorms  clouds  and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles  such as individual hills fall within this category   4 2  Mesoscale  Mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from microscale limits to synoptic scale limits and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth s surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer  troposphere  tropopause  and the lower section of the stratosphere  Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to the lifetime of the event  which in some cases can be weeks  The events typically of interest are thunderstorms  squall lines  fronts  precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones  and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes   4 3  Synoptic scale  Synoptic scale meteorology is generally large area dynamics referred to in horizontal coordinates and with respect to time  The phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events like extratropical cyclones  baroclinic troughs and ridges  frontal zones  and to some extent jet streams  All of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time  The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation stations   4 4  Global scale  Global scale meteorology is study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles  Also  very large scale oscillations are of importance  These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months  such as the Madden Julian Oscillation  or years  such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation  Global scale pushes the thresholds of the perception of meteorology into climatology  The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales with the further understanding of how the global oscillations cause both climate and weather disturbances in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales   Numerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction  tropical meteorology  atmospheric predictability  and tropospheric stratospheric processes  The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey California developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System  NOGAPS   NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military  Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies   5  Some meteorological principles  5 1  Boundary layer meteorology  Boundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above earth s surface  known as the atmospheric boundary layer  ABL   The effects of the surface – heating  cooling  and friction – cause turbulent mixing within the air layer  Significant fluxes of heat  matter  or momentum on time scales of less than a day are advected by turbulent motions  Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary  including ocean  lake  urban land and non urban land for the study of meteorology   5 2  Dynamic meteorology  Dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere  The idea of air parcel is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere  while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere  An air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere  The fundamental laws of fluid dynamics  thermodynamics  and motion are used to study the atmosphere  The physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature  density  pressure  etc  These variables have unique values in the continuum   6  Applications  6 1  Weather forecasting  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location  Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia  and formally since at least the 19th century  Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve   Once an all human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure  current weather conditions  and sky condition  forecast models are now used to determine future conditions  Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon  which involves pattern recognition skills  teleconnections  knowledge of model performance  and knowledge of model biases  The chaotic nature of the atmosphere  the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere  error involved in measuring the initial conditions  and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases  The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome   There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts  Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property  Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture  and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets  Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days  On an everyday basis  people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day  Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain  snow and the wind chill  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events  and to plan ahead and survive them   6 2  Aviation meteorology  Aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management  It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft  as noted by the Aeronautical Information Manual   The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced  drag increases  lift lessens  and weight increases  The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance  In extreme cases  2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes  It takes but 1 2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage   6 3  Agricultural meteorology  Meteorologists  soil scientists  agricultural hydrologists  and agronomists are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution  crop yield  water use efficiency  phenology of plant and animal development  and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems  Conversely  they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather   6 4  Hydrometeorology  Hydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle  the water budget  and the rainfall statistics of storms  A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating  quantitative  precipitation  heavy rain  heavy snow  and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding  Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology  mesoscale and synoptic meteorology  and other geosciences   The multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges  since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently  be optimized for different hard  and software platforms and use different data formats  There are some initiatives   such as the DRIHM project   that are trying to address this issue   6 5  Nuclear meteorology  Nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere   6 6  Maritime meteorology  Maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea  Organizations such as the Ocean Prediction Center  Honolulu National Weather Service forecast office  United Kingdom Met Office  and JMA prepare high seas forecasts for the world s oceans   6 7  Military meteorology  Military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes  In the United States  the United States Navy s Commander  Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and Marine Corps while the United States Air Force s Air Force Weather Agency is responsible for the Air Force and Army   7  See also  8  References  9  Further
