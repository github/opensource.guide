Orchidaceae is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant  commonly known as the orchid family  Along with the Asteraceae  they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants  with between 21 950 and 26 049 currently accepted species  found in 880 genera  The determination of which family is larger is still under debate  because verified data on the members of such enormous families are continually in flux  Regardless  the number of orchid species nearly equals the number of bony fishes and more than twice the number of bird species  and about four times the number of mammal species  The family also encompasses about 6–11% of all seed plants  The largest genera are Bulbophyllum  2 000 species   Epidendrum  1 500 species   Dendrobium  1 400 species  and Pleurothallis  1 000 species    The family also includes Vanilla  the genus of the vanilla plant   Orchis  type genus   and many commonly cultivated plants such as Phalaenopsis and Cattleya  Moreover  since the introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 19th century  horticulturists have produced more than 100 000 hybrids and cultivars   1  Etymology  The type genus  i e  the genus after which the family is named  is Orchis  The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek     literally meaning  testicle   because of the shape of the twin tubers in some species of Orchis  The term  orchid  was introduced in 1845 by John Lindley in School Botany  as a shortened form of Orchidaceae   2  Description  Orchids are easily distinguished from other plants  as they share some very evident shared derived characteristics  or  apomorphies   Among these are  bilateral symmetry of the flower  zygomorphism   many resupinate flowers  a nearly always highly modified petal  labellum   fused stamens and carpels  and extremely small seeds   2 1  Stem and roots  All orchids are perennial herbs that lack any permanent woody structure  They can grow according to two patterns   Monopodial  The stem grows from a single bud  leaves are added from the apex each year and the stem grows longer accordingly  The stem of orchids with a monopodial growth can reach several metres in length  as in Vanda and Vanilla   Sympodial  Sympodial orchids have a front  the newest growth  and a back  the oldest growth   The plant produces a series of adjacent shoots which grow to a certain size  bloom and then stop growing and are replaced  Sympodial orchids grow laterally rather than vertically  following the surface of their support  The growth continues by development of new leads  with their own leaves and roots  sprouting from or next to those of the previous year  as in Cattleya  While a new lead is developing  the rhizome may start its growth again from a so called  eye   an undeveloped bud  thereby branching  Sympodial orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a rhizome  which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil  Terrestrial orchids may be rhizomatous or form corms or tubers  The root caps of terrestrial orchids are smooth and white   Some sympodial terrestrial orchids  such as Orchis and Ophrys  have two subterranean tuberous roots  One is used as a food reserve for wintry periods  and provides for the development of the other one  from which visible growth develops   In warm and constantly humid climates  many terrestrial orchids do not need pseudobulbs   Epiphytic orchids  those that grow upon a support  have modified aerial roots that can sometimes be a few meters long  In the older parts of the roots  a modified spongy epidermis  called velamen  has the function to absorb humidity  It is made of dead cells and can have a silvery grey  white or brown appearance  In some orchids  the velamen includes spongy and fibrous bodies near the passage cells  called tilosomes   The cells of the root epidermis grow at a right angle to the axis of the root to allow them to get a firm grasp on their support  Nutrients mainly come from animal droppings and other organic detritus collecting among on their supporting surfaces   The base of the stem of sympodial epiphytes  or in some species essentially the entire stem  may be thickened to form a pseudobulb that contains nutrients and water for drier periods   The pseudobulb has a smooth surface with lengthwise grooves  and can have different shapes  often conical or oblong  Its size is very variable  in some small species of Bulbophyllum  it is no longer than two millimeters  while in the largest orchid in the world  Grammatophyllum speciosum  giant orchid   it can reach three meters  Some Dendrobium species have long  canelike pseudobulbs with short  rounded leaves over the whole length  some other orchids have hidden or extremely small pseudobulbs  completely included inside the leaves   With ageing  the pseudobulb sheds its leaves and becomes dormant  At this stage it is often called a backbulb  Backbulbs still hold nutrition for the plant  but then a pseudobulb usually takes over  exploiting the last reserves accumulated in the backbulb  which eventually dies off  too  A pseudobulb typically lives for about five years  Orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs are also said to have growths  an individual component of a sympodial plant   2 2  Leaves  Like most monocots  orchids generally have simple leaves with parallel veins  although some Vanilloideae have a reticulate venation  Leaves may be ovate  lanceolate  or orbiculate  and very variable in size on the individual plant  Their characteristics are often diagnostic  They are normally alternate on the stem  often folded lengthwise along the centre   plicate    and have no stipules  Orchid leaves often have siliceous bodies called stegmata in the vascular bundle sheaths  not present in the Orchidoideae  and are fibrous   The structure of the leaves corresponds to the specific habitat of the plant  Species that typically bask in sunlight  or grow on sites which can be occasionally very dry  have thick  leathery leaves and the laminae are covered by a waxy cuticle to retain their necessary water supply  Shade loving species  on the other hand  have long  thin leaves   The leaves of most orchids are perennial  that is  they live for several years  while others  especially those with plicate leaves as in Catasetum  shed them annually and develop new leaves together with new pseudobulbs   The leaves of some orchids are considered ornamental  The leaves of the Macodes sanderiana  a semiterrestrial or rock hugging   lithophyte   orchid  show a sparkling silver and gold veining on a light green background  The cordate leaves of Psychopsis limminghei are light brownish green with maroon puce markings  created by flower pigments  The attractive mottle of the leaves of lady s slippers from tropical and subtropical Asia  Paphiopedilum   is caused by uneven distribution of chlorophyll  Also  Phalaenopsis schilleriana is a pastel pink orchid with leaves spotted dark green and light green  The jewel orchid  Ludisia discolor  is grown more for its colorful leaves than its white flowers   Some orchids  as Dendrophylax lindenii  ghost orchid   Aphyllorchis and Taeniophyllum depend on their green roots for photosynthesis and lack normally developed leaves  as do all of the heterotrophic species   Orchids of the genus Corallorhiza  coralroot orchids  lack leaves altogether and instead wrap their roots around the roots of mature trees and use specialized fungi to harvest sugars   2 3  Flowers  Orchidaceae are well known for the many structural variations in their flowers   Some orchids have single flowers  but most have a racemose inflorescence  sometimes with a large number of flowers  The flowering stem can be basal  that is  produced from the base of the tuber  like in Cymbidium  apical  meaning it grows from the apex of the main stem  like in Cattleya  or axillary  from the leaf axil  as in Vanda   As an apomorphy of the clade  orchid flowers are primitively zygomorphic  bilaterally symmetrical   although in some genera like Mormodes  Ludisia and Macodes  this kind of symmetry may be difficult to notice   The orchid flower  like most flowers of monocots  has two whorls of sterile elements  The outer whorl has three sepals and the inner whorl has three petals  The sepals are usually very similar to the petals  and thus called tepals  1   but may be completely distinct   The medial petal  called the labellum or lip  6   which is always modified and enlarged  is actually the upper medial petal  however  as the flower develops  the inferior ovary  7  or the pedicel usually rotates 180 degrees  so that the labellum arrives at the lower part of the flower  thus becoming suitable to form a platform for pollinators  This characteristic  called resupination  occurs primitively in the family and is considered apomorphic  a derived characteristic all Orchidaceae share  The torsion of the ovary is very evident from the longitudinal section shown  below right   Some orchids have secondarily lost this resupination  e g  Zygopetalum and Epidendrum secundum  The normal form of the sepals can be found in Cattleya  where they form a triangle  In Paphiopedilum  Venus slippers   the lower two sepals are fused into a synsepal  while the lip has taken the form of a slipper  In Masdevallia  all the sepals are fused   Orchid flowers with abnormal numbers of petals or lips are called peloric  Peloria is a genetic trait  but its expression is environmentally influenced and may appear random  Orchid flowers primitively had three stamens  but this situation is now limited to the genus Neuwiedia  Apostasia and the Cypripedioideae have two stamens  the central one being sterile and reduced to a staminode  All of the other orchids  the clade called Monandria  retain only the central stamen  the others being reduced to staminodes  4   The filaments of the stamens are always adnate  fused  to the style to form cylindrical structure called the gynostemium or column  2   In the primitive Apostasioideae  this fusion is only partial  in the Vanilloideae  it is more deep  in Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae  it is total  The stigma  9  is very asymmetrical  as all of its lobes are bent towards the centre of the flower and lie on the bottom of the column   Pollen is released as single grains  like in most other plants  in the Apostasioideae  Cypripedioideae and Vanilloideae  In the other subfamilies  that comprise the great majority of orchids  the anther  3   carries and two pollinia   A pollinium is a waxy mass of pollen grains held together by the glue like alkaloid viscin  containing both cellulosic strands and mucopolysaccharides  Each pollinium is connected to a filament which can take the form of a caudicle  as in Dactylorhiza or Habenaria  or a stipe  as in Vanda  Caudicles or stipes hold the pollinia to the viscidium  a sticky pad which sticks the pollinia to the body of pollinators   At the upper edge of the stigma of single anthered orchids  in front of the anther cap  there is the rostellum  5   a slender extension involved in the complex pollination mechanism   As mentioned  the ovary is always inferior  located behind the flower   It is three carpelate and one or  more rarely  three partitioned  with parietal placentation  axile in the Apostasioideae    In 2011  a member of the genus Bulbophyllum  Bulbophyllum nocturnum  was discovered to flower nocturnally   2 4  Fruits and seeds  The ovary typically develops into a capsule that is dehiscent by three or six longitudinal slits  while remaining closed at both ends   The seeds are generally almost microscopic and very numerous  in some species over a million per capsule  After ripening  they blow off like dust particles or spores  They lack endosperm and must enter symbiotic relationships with various mycorrhizal basidiomyceteous fungi that provide them the necessary nutrients to germinate  so that all orchid species are mycoheterotrophic during germination and reliant upon fungi to complete their lifecycles  As the chance for a seed to meet a suitable fungus is very small  only a minute fraction of all the seeds released grow into adult plants  In cultivation  germination typically takes weeks   Horticultural techniques have been devised for germinating orchid seeds on an artificial nutrient medium  eliminating the requirement of the fungus for germination and greatly aiding the propagation of ornamental orchids  The usual medium for the sowing of orchids in artificial conditions is agar agar gel combined with a carbohydrate energy source  The carbohydrate source can be combinations of discrete sugars or can be derived from other sources such as banana  pineapple  peach or even tomato puree or coconut water  After the preparation of the agar agar medium it is poured into test tubes or jars which are then autoclaved  or cooked in a pressure cooker  to sterilize the medium  After cooking  the medium begins to gel as it cools   2 5  Pollination  The complex mechanisms which orchids have evolved to achieve cross pollination were investigated by Charles Darwin and described in Fertilisation of Orchids  1862   Orchids have developed highly specialized pollination systems  thus the chances of being pollinated are often scarce  so orchid flowers usually remain receptive for very long periods  rendering unpollinated flowers long lasting in cultivation  Most orchids deliver pollen in a single mass  Each time pollination succeeds  thousands of ovules can be fertilized   Pollinators are often visually attracted by the shape and colours of the labellum  However  some Bulbophyllum species attract male fruit flies  Bactrocera spp   solely via a floral chemical which simultaneously acts as a floral reward  e g  methyl eugenol  raspberry ketone or zingerone  to perform pollination  The flowers may produce attractive odours  Although absent in most species  nectar may be produced in a spur of the labellum  8 in the illustration above   or on the point of the sepals  or in the septa of the ovary  the most typical position amongst the Asparagales   In orchids that produce pollinia  pollination happens as some variant of the following sequence  when the pollinator enters into the flower  it touches a viscidium  which promptly sticks to its body  generally on the head or abdomen  While leaving the flower  it pulls the pollinium out of the anther  as it is connected to the viscidium by the caudicle or stipe  The caudicle then bends and the pollinium is moved forwards and downwards  When the pollinator enters another flower of the same species  the pollinium has taken such position that it will stick to the stigma of the second flower  just below the rostellum  pollinating it  The possessors of orchids may be able to reproduce the process with a pencil  small paintbrush  or other similar device   Some orchids mainly or totally rely on self pollination  especially in colder regions where pollinators are particularly rare  The caudicles may dry up if the flower has not been visited by any pollinator  and the pollinia then fall directly on the stigma  Otherwise  the anther may rotate and then enter the stigma cavity of the flower  as in Holcoglossum amesianum    The slipper orchid Paphiopedilum parishii reproduces by self fertilization  This occurs when the anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly contacts the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent or floral assembly   The labellum of the Cypripedioideae is poke bonnet shaped  and has the function of trapping visiting insects  The only exit leads to the anthers that deposit pollen on the visitor   In some extremely specialized orchids  such as the Eurasian genus Ophrys  the labellum is adapted to have a colour  shape and odour which attracts male insects via mimicry of a receptive female  Pollination happens as the insect attempts to mate with flowers   Many neotropical orchids are pollinated by male orchid bees  which visit the flowers to gather volatile chemicals they require to synthesize pheromonal attractants  Each type of orchid places the pollinia on a different body part of a different species of bee  so as to enforce proper cross pollination   A rare achlorophyllous saprophytic orchid growing entirely underground in Australia  Rhizanthella slateri  is never exposed to light  and depends on ants and other terrestrial insects to pollinate it   Catasetum  a genus discussed briefly by Darwin  actually launches its viscid pollinia with explosive force when an insect touches a seta  knocking the pollinator off the flower   After pollination  the sepals and petals fade and wilt  but they usually remain attached to the ovary   2 6  Asexual reproduction  Some species  such as Phalaenopsis  Dendrobium and Vanda  produce offshoots or plantlets formed from one of the nodes along the stem  through the accumulation of growth hormones at that point  These shoots are known as keiki   3  Taxonomy  The taxonomy of this family is in constant flux  as new studies continue to identify more classificatory elements  The Orchidaceae is currently placed in the order Asparagales by the APG III system of 2009   Five subfamilies are recognised  The cladogram has been made according to the APG system   3 1  Evolution  A study in the scientific journal Nature has hypothesized that the origin of orchids goes back much longer than originally expected  An extinct species of stingless bee  Proplebeia dominicana  was found trapped in Miocene amber from about 15 20 million years ago  The bee was carrying pollen of a previously unknown orchid taxon  Meliorchis caribea  on its wings  This find is the first evidence of fossilised orchids to date and shows insects were active pollinators of orchids then  The extinct orchid M  caribea has been placed within the extant tribe Cranichideae  subtribe Goodyerinae  subfamily Orchidoideae    Genetic sequencing indicates orchids may have arisen earlier  76 to 84 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous  In other words  they may have coexisted with dinosaurs According to Mark W  Chase et al   2001   the overall biogeography and phylogenetic patterns of Orchidaceae show they are even older and may go back roughly 100 million years   Using the molecular clock method  it was possible to determine the age of the major branches of the orchid family  This also confirmed that the subfamily Vanilloideae is a branch at the basal dichotomy of the monandrous orchids  and must have evolved very early in the evolution of the family  Since this subfamily occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions  from tropical America to tropical Asia  New Guinea and West Africa  and the continents began to split about 100 million years ago  significant biotic exchange must have occurred after this split  since the age of Vanilla is estimated at 60 to 70 million years    3 2  Genera  The following are amongst the most notable genera of the orchid family   Aa  Abdominea  Acampe

but they are also found above the Arctic Circle  in southern Patagonia  and two species of Nematoceras on Macquarie Island at 54° south   The following list gives a rough overview of their distribution   Oceania  50 to 70 genera  North America  20 to 26 genera  tropical America  212 to 250 genera  tropical Asia  260 to 300 genera  tropical Africa  230 to 270 genera  Europe and temperate Asia  40 to 60 genera  5  Ecology  A majority of orchids are perennial epiphytes  which grow anchored to trees or shrubs in the tropics and subtropics  Species such as Angraecum sororium are lithophytes  growing on rocks or very rocky soil  Other orchids  including the majority of temperate Orchidaceae  are terrestrial and can be found in habitat areas such as grasslands or forest   Some orchids  such as Neottia and Corallorhiza  lack chlorophyll  so are unable to photosynthesize  Instead  these species obtain energy and nutrients by parasitising soil fungi through the formation of orchid mycorrhizas  The fungi involved include those that form ectomycorrhizas with trees and other woody plants  parasites such as Armillaria  and saprotrophs  These orchids are known as myco heterotrophs  but were formerly  incorrectly  described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter  While only a few species are achlorophyllous holoparasites  all orchids are myco heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth  and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi   6  Uses  6 1  Perfumery  The scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumers  using headspace technology and gas liquid chromatography  to identify potential fragrance chemicals   6 2  Horticulture  The other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers  Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical  but quite a few which grow in colder climates can be found on the market  Temperate species available at nurseries include Ophrys apifera  bee orchid   Gymnadenia conopsea  fragrant orchid   Anacamptis pyramidalis  pyramidal orchid  and Dactylorhiza fuchsii  common spotted orchid    Orchids of all types have also often been sought by collectors of both species and hybrids  Many hundreds of societies and clubs worldwide have been established  These can be small  local clubs such as the   or larger  national organisations such as the   Both serve to encourage cultivation and collection of orchids  but some go further by concentrating on conservation or research   The term  botanical orchid  loosely denotes those small flowered  tropical orchids belonging to several genera that do not fit into the  florist  orchid category  A few of these genera contain enormous numbers of species  Some  such as Pleurothallis and Bulbophyllum  contain approximately 1700 and 2000 species  respectively  and are often extremely vegetatively diverse  The primary use of the term is among orchid hobbyists wishing to describe unusual species they grow  though it is also used to distinguish naturally occurring orchid species from horticulturally created hybrids   6 3  Use as food  The dried seed pods of one orchid genus  Vanilla  especially Vanilla planifolia   are commercially important as flavoring in baking  for perfume manufacture and aromatherapy   The underground tubers of terrestrial orchids  mainly Orchis mascula  early purple orchid   are ground to a powder and used for cooking  such as in the hot beverage salep or in the Turkish frozen treat dondurma  The name salep has been claimed to come from the Arabic expression ḥasyu al tha`lab   fox testicles   but it appears more likely the name comes directly from the Arabic name saḥlab  The similarity in appearance to testes naturally accounts for salep being considered an aphrodisiac   The dried leaves of Jumellea fragrans are used to flavor rum on Reunion Island   Some saprophytic orchid species of the group Gastrodia produce potato like tubers and were consumed as food by native peoples in Australia and can be successfully cultivated  notably Gastrodia sesamoides  Wild stands of these plants can still be found in the same areas as early aboriginal settlements  such as Ku ring gai Chase National Park in Australia  Aboriginal peoples located the plants in habitat by observing where bandicoots had scratched in search of the tubers after detecting the plants underground by scent   6 4  Traditional medicinal uses  Orchids have been used in traditional medicine in an effort to treat many diseases and ailments  They have been used as a source of herbal remedies in China since 2800 BC  Gastrodia elata is one of the three orchids listed in the earliest known Chinese Materia Medica  Shennon bencaojing   c  100 AD   Theophrastus mentions orchids in his Enquiry into Plants  372–286 BC    7  Cultural symbolism  Orchids have many associations with symbolic values  For example  the orchid is the City Flower of Shaoxing  China  Cattleya mossiae is the national Venezuelan flower  while Cattleya trianae is the national flower of Colombia  Vanda  Miss Joaquim  is the national flower of Singapore  Guarianthe skinneri is the national flower of Costa Rica  Orchids native to the Mediterranean are depicted on the Ara Pacis in Rome  until now the only known instance of orchids in ancient art  and the earliest in European art   8  See also  Adaptation  a movie based on The Orchid Thief  American Orchid Society  Distribution of orchid species  Italian Group for
