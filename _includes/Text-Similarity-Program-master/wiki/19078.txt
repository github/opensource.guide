Macedonia is a geographical and historical region of the Balkan peninsula in southeastern Europe  Its boundaries have changed considerably over time  but nowadays the region is considered to include parts of six Balkan countries  Greece  the Republic of Macedonia  Bulgaria  Albania  Serbia and Kosovo  It covers approximately and has a population of 4 76 million   Its oldest known settlements date back approximately 9 000 years  From the middle of the 4th century BC  the Kingdom of Macedon became the dominant power on the Balkan peninsula  since then Macedonia has had a diverse history   1  Etymology  2  Boundaries and definitions  The definition of Macedonia has changed several times throughout history   Prior to its expansion under Philip II  the ancient kingdom of Macedonia  to which the modern region owes its name  lay entirely within the central and western parts of the current Greek province of Macedonia  In the second century Macedonia covered approximately the area where it is considered to be today  but the northern regions of today Republic of Macedonia were not identified as Macedonian lands  However for reasons that are still unclear  over the next eleven centuries Macedonia s location was changed significantly  The Roman province of Macedonia consisted of what is today Northern and Central Greece  much of the geographical area of the present day Republic of Macedonia and southeast Albania  Simply put  the Romans created a much larger administrative area under that name than the original ancient Macedon  In late Roman times  the provincial boundaries were reorganized to form the Diocese of Macedonia  consisting of most of modern mainland Greece right across the Aegean to include Crete  southern Albania  and parts of modern day Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia  In the Byzantine Empire  a province under the name of Macedonia was carved out of the original Theme of Thrace  which was well east of the Struma River  This thema variously included parts of Thrace and gave its name to the Macedonian dynasty  Hence  Byzantine documents of this era that mention Macedonia are most probably referring to the Macedonian thema  The region of Macedonia  on the other hand  which was ruled by the First Bulgarian Empire throughout the 9th and the 10th century  was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire in 1018 as the Themе of Bulgaria   With the gradual conquest of southeastern Europe by the Ottomans in the late 14th century  the name of Macedonia disappeared as an administrative designation for several centuries and was rarely displayed on maps  The name was again revived to mean a distinct geographical region  In the late 19th century  it developed roughly the same borders that it has today   3  Demographics  During medieval and modern times  Macedonia has been known as a Balkan region inhabited by ethnic Greeks  Albanians  Vlachs  Serbs  Bulgarians  Jews  and Turks  Today  as a frontier region where several very different cultures meet  Macedonia has an extremely diverse demographic profile   Macedonian Greeks self identify culturally and regionally as  Macedonians   Greek  Μακεδόνες  Makedónes   They form the majority of the region s population  ~51%   They number approximately 2 500 000 and  today  they live almost entirely in Greek Macedonia  The Greek Macedonian population is mixed  with other indigenous groups and with a large influx of Greek refugees descending from Asia Minor  Pontic Greeks  and East Thracian Greeks in the early 20th century  This is due to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey  during which over 1 2 million Orthodox Christian refugees from Turkey were settled in Greece  638 000 of whom were settled in the Greek province of Macedonia  Smaller Greek minorities exist in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia  although their numbers are difficult to ascertain  In official census results  only 86 persons declared themselves Greeks in Bulgarian Macedonia  Blagoevgrad Province  in 2001  out of a total of 3 408 in all Bulgaria  while only 442 persons described themselves as Greeks in the 2002 census in the Republic of Macedonia   Ethnic Macedonians self identify as  Macedonians   Macedonian  Македонци  Makedonci  in an ethnic sense as well as in the regional sense  They are the second largest ethnic group in the region  Because of their primarily Slavic origin they are also known as  Macedonian Slavs  and  Slav Macedonians   Greek  Σλαβομακεδόνες   Slavomakedones    They form the majority of the population in the Republic of Macedonia where according to the 2002 census  approximately 1 300 000 people declared themselves as Macedonians  According to the latest Bulgarian census held in 2001  there are 3 117 people declaring themselves ethnic Macedonians in the Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria  Pirin Macedonia   The official number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria is 5 071  A relatively small number of ethnic Macedonians exist among the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia  There has not been a census in Greece on the question of mother tongue since 1951  when the census recorded 41 017 Slavic speakers  mostly in the West Macedonia periphery of Greece  The linguistic classification of the Slavic dialects spoken by these people can be either Bulgarian or Macedonian  although the people themselves call their language  Slavic   Most of these people declare themselves as ethnic Greeks  Slavophone Greeks   although there are small groups espousing ethnic Macedonian and Bulgarian national identities  In the 1989 Albanian census  approximately 5 000 Albanian citizens declared themselves Macedonians   Macedonian Bulgarians are ethnic Bulgarians who self identify regionally as  Macedonians   Bulgarian  Mакедонци  Makedontsi   They represent the bulk of the population of Bulgarian Macedonia  also known as  Pirin Macedonia    They number approximately 370 000 in the Blagoevgrad Province where they are mainly situated  There are small Bulgarian identifying groups in Albania  Greece and the Republic of Macedonia with an uncertain size  In the Republic of Macedonia  1 417 people claimed a Bulgarian ethnic identity in the 2002 census  Paradoxically  during the last few years around 60 000 Macedonians have applied for Bulgarian citizenship and some 10 000 ethnic Macedonians have already obtained Bulgarian passports  Bulgaria s admission to the European Union is evidently a powerful motivation factor  In order to obtain it they must sign a statement proving they are Bulgarian by origin  effectively not recognizing their rights as a minority   Albanians are another major ethnic group in the region  Ethnic Albanians make up the majority in certain northern and western parts of the Republic of Macedonia  and account for 25 2% of the total population of the Republic of Macedonia  according to the 2002 census   Smaller numbers of Turks  Bosniaks  Roma  Serbs  Vlachs  Aromanians and Megleno Romanians   Egyptians  Armenians and Jews  Sephardim and Romaniotes  can also be found in Macedonia   3 1  Religion  Most present day inhabitants of the region are Eastern Orthodox Christians  principally of the Greek Orthodox  Bulgarian Orthodox  Serbian Orthodox Churches and Macedonian Orthodox Church  Notable Muslim minorities are present among the Albanian  Bulgarian  Pomaks   Macedonian  Torbeš   Bosniak  and Turkish populations   4  History  4 1  Early Neolithic  While Macedonia shows signs of human habitation as old as the paleolithic period  among which the Petralona cave with the oldest European humanoid   the earliest known settlements  such as Nea Nikomedeia in Imathia  today s Greek Macedonia   date back 9 000 years  The houses at Nea Nikomedeia were constructed—as were most structures throughout the Neolithic in northern Greece—of wattle and daub on a timber frame  The cultural assemblage includes well made pottery in simple shapes with occasional decoration in white on a red background  clay female figurines of the  rod headed  type known from Thessaly to the Danube Valley  stone axes and adzes  chert blades  and ornaments of stone including curious  nose plugs  of uncertain function  The assemblage of associated objects differs from one house to the next  suggesting some degree of craft specialisation had already been established from the beginning of the site s history  The farming economy was based on the cultivation of cereal crops such as wheat and barley and pulses and on the herding of sheep and goats  with some cattle and pigs  Hunting played a relatively minor role in the economy  Surviving from 7000 to 5500 BCE  this Early Neolithic settlement was occupied for over a thousand years   4 2  Middle Neolithic  The Middle Neolithic period  c  5500 to 4500 BC  is at present best represented at Servia in the Haliacmon Valley in western Macedonia  where the typical red on cream pottery in the Sesklo style emphasises the settlement s southern orientation  Pottery of this date has been found at a number of sites in Central and Eastern Macedonia but so far none has been extensively excavated   4 3  Late Neolithic  The Late Neolithic period  c  4500 to 3500 BC  is well represented by both excavated and unexcavated sites throughout the region  though it should be noted that in Eastern Macedonia levels of this period are still called Middle Neolithic according to the terminology used in the Balkans   Rapid changes in pottery styles  and the discovery of fragments of pottery showing trade with quite distant regions  indicate that society  economy and technology were all changing rapidly  Among the most important of these changes were the start of copper working  convincingly demonstrated by Renfrew to have been learnt from the cultural groups of Bulgaria and Roumania to the North  Principal excavated settlements of this period include Makryialos and Paliambela near the western shore of the Thermaic gulf  Thermi to the south of Thessaloniki and Sitagroi and Dikili Tas in the Drama plain  Some of these sites were densely occupied and formed large mounds  known to the local inhabitants of the region today as  toumbas    Others were much less densely occupied and spread for as much as a kilometer  Makryialos   Both types are found at the same time in the same districts and it is presumed that differences in social organisation are reflected by these differences in settlement organisation  Some communities were clearly concerned to protect themselves with different kinds of defensive arrangements  ditches at Makryialos and concentric walls at Paliambela  The best preserved buildings were discovered at Dikili Tas  where long timber framed structures had been organised in rows and some had been decorated with bulls  skulls fastened to the outside of the walls and plastered over with clay   Remarkable evidence for cult activity has been found at Promachonas Topolnica  which straddles the Greek Bulgarian border to the north of Serres  Here a deep pit appeared to have been roofed to make a subterranean room  in it were successive layers of debris including large numbers of figurines  bulls  skulls  and pottery  including several rare and unusual shapes   The farming economy of this period continued the practices established at the beginning of the Neolithic  although sheep and goats were less dominant among the animals than they had previously been  and the cultivation of vines  Vitis vinifera  is well attested   Only a few burials have been discovered from the whole of the Neolithic period in northern Greece and no clear pattern can be deduced  Grave offerings  however  seem to have been very limited   4 4  Ancient Macedonia  500 BC to 146 BC   In classical times  the region of Macedonia comprised parts of what at the time was known as Macedonia  Illyria and Thrace  Among others  in its lands were located the kingdoms of Paeonia  Dardania  Macedonia and Pelagonia  historical tribes like the Agrianes  and colonies of southern Greek city states  Prior to the Macedonian ascendancy  parts of southern Macedonia were populated by the Bryges  while western   i  e   Upper  Macedonia  was inhabited by Macedonian and Illyrian tribes  Whilst numerous wars are later recorded between the Illyrian and Macedonian Kingdoms  the Bryges might have co existed peacefully with the Macedonians  In the time of Classical Greece  Paionia  whose exact boundaries are obscure  originally included the whole Axius River valley and the surrounding areas  in what is now the northern part of the Greek region of Macedonia  most of the Republic of Macedonia  and a small part of western Bulgaria  By 500 BC  the ancient kingdom of Macedon was centered somewhere between the southern slopes of Lower Olympus and the lowest reach of the Haliakmon River  During the Persian Wars  the kingdom of Macedonia was subject to the Persians but after the battle of Plataia regained its freedom  Under Philip II and Alexander the Great  the kingdom of Macedonia forcefully expanded  placing the whole of the region of Macedonia under their rule  Alexander s conquests produced a lasting extension of Hellenistic culture and thought across the ancient Near East  but his empire broke up on his death  His generals divided the empire between them  founding their own states and dynasties  The kingdom of Macedon was taken by Cassander  who ruled it until his death in 297 BC  At the time  Macedonian control over the Thracoillyrian states of the region slowly waned  although the kingdom of Macedonia remained the most potent regional power  This period also saw several Celtic invasions into Macedonia  However  the Celts were each time successfully repelled by Cassander  and later Antigonus  leaving little overall influence on the region   4 5  Roman Macedonia  Macedonian sovereignty in the region was brought to an end at the hands of the rising power of Rome in the 2nd century BC  Philip V of Macedon took his kingdom to war against the Romans in two wars during his reign  221 BC 179 BC   The First Macedonian War  215 BC 205 BC  was fairly successful for the Macedonians but Philip was decisively defeated in the Second Macedonian War in  200 BC 197 BC   Although he survived war with Rome  his successor Perseus of Macedon  reigned 179 BC 168 BC  did not  having taken Macedon into the Third Macedonian War in  171 BC 168 BC   he lost his kingdom when he was defeated  Macedonia was initially divided into four republics subject to Rome before finally being annexed in 146 BC as a Roman province  Around this time  vulgar Latin was introduced in the Balkans by Latin speaking colonists and military personnel   With the division of the Roman Empire into west and east in 298 AD  Macedonia came under the rule of Rome s Byzantine successors  The population of the entire region was  however  depleted by destructive invasions of various Gothic and Hun tribes c  300 – 400s AD  Despite this  other parts of the Byzantine empire continued to flourish  in particular some coastal cities such as Thessaloniki became important trade and cultural centre  Despite the empire s power  from the beginning of the 6th century the Byzantine dominions were subject to frequent raids by various Slavic tribes which  in the course of centuries  eventually resulted in drastic demographic and cultural changes in the Empire s Balkan provinces  Although traditional scholarship attributes these changes to large scale colonizations by Slavic speaking groups  it has been proposed that a generalized dissipation of Roman identity might have commenced in the third century  especially among rural provincials who were crippled by harsh taxation and famines  Given this background  penetrations carried by successive waves of relatively small numbers of Slavic warriors and their families might have been capable of assimilating large numbers of indegenes into their cultural model  which was sometimes seen as a more attractive alternative  In this way and in the course of time  great parts of Macedonia came to be controlled by Slavic speaking communities  Despite numerous attacks on Thessaloniki  the city held out  and Byzantine Roman culture continued to flourish  although Slavic cultural influence steadily increased   The Slavic settlements organized themselves along tribal and territorially based lines which were referred to by Byzantine Greek historians as  Sklaviniai   The Sklaviniai continued to intermittently assault the Byzantine Empire  either independently  or aided by Bulgar or Avar contingents  Around 680 AD a  Bulgar  group  which was largely composed of the descendants of former Roman Christians taken captive by the Avars   led by khan Kuber  theorized to have belonged to the same clan as the Danubian Bulgarian khan Asparukh   settled in the Pelagonian plain  and launched campaigns to the region of Thessaloniki  When the Empire could spare imperial troops  it attempted to regain control of its lost Balkan territories  By the time of Constans II a significant number of the Slavs of Macedonia were captured and transferred to central Asia Minor where they were forced to recognize the authority of the Byzantine emperor and serve in its ranks  In the late 7th century Justinian II organized again a massive expedition against the Sklaviniai and Bulgars of Macedonia  Launching from Constantinople  he subdued many Slavic tribes and established the Theme of Thrace in the hinterland of the Great City  and pushed on into Thessaloniki  However  on his return he was ambushed by the Slavo Bulgars of Kuber  losing a great part of his army  booty  and subsequently  his throne  Despite these temporary successes  rule in the region was far from stable since not all as the Sklaviniae were pacified  and those that were often rebelled  The emperors rather resorted to withdrawing their defensive line south along the Aegean coast  until the late 8th century  Although a new theme—that of  Macedonia —was subsequently created  it did not correspond to today s geographic territory  but one farther east  centred on Adrianople   carved out of the already existing Thracian and Helladic themes   4 6  Medieval Macedonia  There are no Byzantine records of  Sklaviniai  after 836 837 as they were absorbed into the expanding First Bulgarian Empire  Slavic influence in the region strengthened along with the rise of this state  which incorporated parts of the region to its domain in 837 AD  In the early 860s Saints Cyril and Methodius  two Byzantine Greek brothers from Thessaloniki  created the first Slavic Glagolitic alphabet in which the Old Church Slavonic language was first transcribed  and are thus commonly referred to as the apostles of the Slavic world  Their cultural heritage was acquired and developed in medieval Bulgaria  where after 885 the region of Ohrid  present day Republic of Macedonia  became a significant ecclesiastical center with the nomination of the Saint Clement of Ohrid for  first archbishop in Bulgarian language  with residence in this region  In conjunction with another disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius  Saint Naum  Clement created a flourishing Slavic cultural center around Ohrid  where pupils were taught theology in the Old Church Slavonic language and the Glagolitic and Cyrillic script at what is now called Ohrid Literary School  The Bulgarian Byzantine boundary in the beginning of 10th century passed approximately north of Thessaloniki according to the inscription of Narash  According to the Byzantine author John Kaminiates  at that time the neighbouring settlements around Thessaloniki were inhabited by  Scythians   Bulgarians  and the Slavic tribes of Drugubites and Sagudates  in addition to Greeks   At the end of the 10th century  what is now the Republic of Macedonia became the political and cultural heartland of the First Bulgarian Empire  after Byzantine emperors John I Tzimiskes conquered the eastern part of the Bulgarian state during the Rus –Byzantine War of 970–971  The Bulgarian capital Preslav and the Bulgarian Tsar Boris II were captured  and with the deposition of the Bulgarian regalia in the Hagia Sophia  Bulgaria was officially annexed to Byzantium  A new capital was established at Ohrid  which also became the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate  A new dynasty  that of the Comitopuli under Tsar Samuil and his successors  continued resistance against the Byzantines for several more decades  before also succumbing in 1018  The western part of Bulgaria including Macedonia was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire as the province of Bulgaria  Theme of Bulgaria  and the Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced in rank to an Archbishopric   Intermittent Slavic uprisings continued to occur  often with the support of the Serbian princedoms to the north  Any temporary independence that might have been gained was usually crushed swiftly by the Byzantines  It was also was marked by periods of war between the Normans and Byzantium  The Normans launched offensives from their lands acquired in southern Italy  and temporarily gained rule over small areas in the northwestern coast   From the 12th century  parts of Macedonia were conquered by the Serbian kingdom of Raška  In the 13th century  following the Fourth Crusade  Macedonia was disputed among Byzantine Greeks  Latin crusaders of the short lived Kingdom of Thessalonica  and the revived Bulgarian state  Most of southern Macedonia was secured by the Despotate of Epirus and then by the Empire of Nicaea  while the north was ruled by Bulgaria  After 1261 however  all of Macedonia returned to Byzantine rule  where it largely remained until the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347  Taking advantage of this conflict  the Serb ruler Stefan Dushan expanded his realm and founded the Serbian Empire  which included all of Macedonia  northern and central Greece – excluding Thessaloniki  Athens and the Peloponnese  Dushan s empire however broke up shortly after his death in 1355  After his death rulers of Macedonia were Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his son Marko Mrnjavčević   At this time  the Ottoman threat was looming in the Balkans  as the Ottomans defeated the various Christian principalities  whether Serb  Bulgarian or Greek  After the Ottoman victory in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371  most of Macedonia accepted vassalage to the Ottomans and by the end of the 14th century the Ottoman Empire fully annexed it  Macedonia remained a part of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 500 years  during which time it gained a substantial Turkish minority  Thessaloniki later become the home of a large Sephardi Jewish population following the expulsions of Jews after 1492 from Spain   4 7  Emergence of a Macedonian region  After the revival of Greek  Serbian  and Bulgarian statehood in the 19th century  the Ottoman lands in Europe that became identified as  Macedonia   were contested by all three governments  leading to the creation in the 1890s and 1900s of rival armed groups who divided their efforts between fighting the Turks and one another   The most important of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian Adrianople Revolutionary Committee  BMARC  SMARO from 1902   an alternative version says that it consisted of the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  MRO  TMORO from 1902    under Gotse Delchev who in 1903 rebelled in the so called Ilinden Preobrazhenie Uprising  fighting for an autonomous or independent Macedonian state  before 1902 only Bulgarians could join  but afterward  it invited  any Macedonian or Odrinian  irrespective of nationality  to join together    and the Greek efforts from 1904 until 1908  Greek Struggle for Macedonia   Diplomatic intervention by the European powers led to plans for an autonomous Macedonia under Ottoman rule   It is often claimed that macédoine  the fruit or vegetable salad  was named after the area s very mixed population   4 8  The birth of nationalism and of Macedonian identities  Over the centuries Macedonia had become a multicultural region  The historical references mention Greeks  Bulgarians  Turks  Albanian  Gypsies  Jews and Vlachs  From the Middle Ages to the 20th century the Slav speaking population in Macedonia was identified mostly as Bulgarian or Greek and occasionally as Serbian  During the period of Bulgarian National Revival many Bulgarians from these regions supported the struggle for creation of Bulgarian cultural educational and religious institutions  including Bulgarian Exarchate  Eventually  in the 20th century   Bulgarians  came to be understood as synonymous with  Macedonian Slavs  and  eventually   ethnic Macedonians   Krste Misirkov  a philologist and publicist  mostly known for his work  On the Macedonian Matters   1903   heralded by Macedonians as one of the  founders of the Macedonian nation   stated   The restricted borders of the modern Greek state at its inception in 1830 disappointed the inhabitants of northern Greece  Epirus and Macedonia   Addressing these concerns in 1844  the Greek Prime Minister Kolettis addressed the constitutional assembly in Athens that  the kingdom of Greece is not Greece  it is only a part  the smallest and poorest  of Greece  The Greek is not only he who inhabits the kingdom  but also he who lives in Ioannina  or Thessaloniki  or Serres  or Odrin    He mentions cities and islands that were under Ottoman possession as composing the Great Idea  Greek  Μεγάλη Ιδέα  which meant the reconstruction of the classical Greek world or the revival of the Byzantine Empire  The important idea here is that for Greece  Macedonia was a region with large Greek populations expecting annexation to the new Greek state  At this time  the region which today is the Republic of Macedonia was known as the  fief  vilayet  of Skopje    The 1878 Congress of Berlin changed the Balkan map again  The treaty restored Macedonia and Thrace to the Ottoman Empire  Serbia  Romania and Montenegro were granted full independence  and some territorial expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire  Russia would maintain military advisors in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia until May 1879  Austria Hungary was permitted to occupy Bosnia  Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar  The Congress of Berlin also forced Bulgaria  newly given autonomy by the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano  to return over half of its newly gained territory to the Ottoman Empire  This included Macedonia  a large part of which was given to Bulgaria  due to Russian pressure and the presence of significant numbers of Bulgarians and adherents to the Bulgarian Exarchate  The territorial losses dissatisfied Bulgaria  this fuelled the ambitions of many Bulgarian politicians for the following seventy years  who wanted to review the treaty – by peaceful or military means and to reunite all lands which they claimed had a Bulgarian majority  Besides  Serbia was now interested in the Macedonian lands  until then only Greece was Bulgaria s main contender  which after the addition of Thessaly to Greece in  1881  was bordering Macedonia  Thus  the Berlin Congress renewed the struggle for Turkey in Europe  including the so called Macedonia region  rather than setting up a permanent regime  In the following years  all of the neighboring states struggled over Turkey in Europe  they were only kept at bay by their own restraints  the Ottoman Army and the territorial ambitions of the Great Powers in the region   Serbian policy had a distinct anti Bulgarian flavor  attempting to prevent the Bulgarian influencing the inhabitants of Macedonia  On the other hand  Bulgaria was using the power of its religious institutions  Bulgarian Exarchate established in 1870  to promote its language and make more people identify with Bulgaria  Greece  in addition  was in an advantageous position for protecting its interests through the influence of Patriarchate of Constantinople which traditionally sponsored Greek language and Greek culture schools also in villages with few Greeks  This put the Patriarchate in dispute with the Exarchate  which established schools with Bulgarian education  Indeed  belonging to one or another institution could define a person s national identity  Simply  if a person supported the Patriarchate they were regarded as Greek  whereas if they supported the Exarchate they were regarded as Bulgarian  Locally  however  villagers were not always able to express freely their association with one or the other institution as there were numerous armed groups trying to defend and or expand the territory of each  Some were locally recruited and self organized while others were sent and armed by the protecting states   The aim of the adversaries  however  was not primarily to extend their influence over Macedonia but merely to prevent Macedonia succumbing to the influence of the other  This often violent attempt to persuade the people that they belonged to one ethnic group or another pushed some people to reject both  The severe pressure on the peaceful peasants of Macedonia worked against the plans of the Serbians and Bulgarians to make them adopt their ethnic idea and eventually a social divide became apparent  The British Ambassador in Belgrade in 1927 said   At present the unfortunate Macedonian peasant is between the hammer and the anvil  One day  comitadjis  come to his house and demand under threat lodging  food and money and the next day the gendarm hales him off to prison for having given them  the Macedonian is really a peaceable  fairly industrious agriculturist and if the  Serbian  government give him adequate protection  education  freedom from malaria and decent communications  there seems no reason why he should not become just as Serbian in sentiment as he was Bulgarian 10 years ago   As a result of this game of tug of war  the development of a distinct Macedonian national identity was impeded and delayed  Moreover  when the imperialistic plans of the surrounding states made possible the division of Macedonia  some Macedonian intellectuals such as Misirkov mentioned the necessity of creating a Macedonian national identity which would distinguish the Macedonian Slavs from Bulgarians  Serbians or Greeks   Baptizing Macedonian Slavs as Serbian or Bulgarian aimed therefore to justify these countries  territorial claims over Macedonia  The Greek side  with the assistance of the Patriarchate that was responsible for the schools  could more easily maintain control  because they were spreading Greek identity  For the very same reason the Bulgarians  when preparing the Exarchate s government  1871  included Macedonians in the assembly as  brothers  to prevent any ethnic diversification  On the other hand  the Serbs  unable to establish Serbian speaking schools  used propaganda  Their main concern was to prevent the Slavic speaking Macedonians from acquiring Bulgarian identity through concentrating on the myth of the ancient origins of the Macedonians and simultaneously by the classification of Bulgarians as Tatars and not as Slavs  emphasizing their  Macedonian  characteristics as an intermediate stage between Serbs and Bulgarians  To sum up the Serbian propaganda attempted to inspire the Macedonians with a separate ethnic identity to diminish the Bulgarian influence  This choice was the  Macedonian ethnicity   The Bulgarians never accepted an ethnic diversity from the Slav Macedonians  giving geographic meaning to the term  In 1893 they established the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  VMRO  aiming to confront the Serbian and Greek action in Macedonia  VMRO hoped to answer the Macedonian question through a revolutionary movement  and so they instigated the Ilinden Uprising  1903  to release some Ottoman territory  Bulgaria used this to internationalize the Macedonian question  Ilinden changed Greece s stance which decided to take Para military action  In order to protect the Greek Macedonians and Greek interests  Greece sent officers to train guerrillas and organize militias  Macedonian Struggle   known as makedonomahi  Macedonian fighters   essentially to fight the Bulgarians  After that it was obvious that the Macedonian Question could be answered only with a war   The rise of the Albanian and the Turkish nationalism after 1908  however  prompted Greece  Serbia and Bulgaria to bury their differences with regard to Macedonia and to form a joint coalition against the Ottoman Empire in 1912  Disregarding public opinion in Bulgaria  which was in support of the establishment of an autonomous Macedonian province under a Christian governor  the Bulgarian government entered a pre war treaty with Serbia which divided the region into two parts  The part of Macedonia west and north of the line of partition was contested by both Serbia and Bulgaria and was subject to the arbitration of the Russian Tsar after the war  Serbia formally renounced any claims to the part of Macedonia south and east of the line  which was declared to be within the Bulgarian sphere of interest  The pre treaty between Greece and Bulgaria  however  did not include any agreement on the division of the conquered territories – evidently both countries hoped to occupy as much territory as possible having their sights primarily set on Thessaloniki   In the First Balkan War  Bulgaria  Serbia  Greece and Montenegro occupied almost all Ottoman held territories in Europe  Bulgaria bore the brunt of the war fighting on the Thracian front against the main Ottoman forces  Both her war expenditures and casualties in the First Balkan War were higher than those of Serbia  Greece and Montenegro combined  Macedonia itself was occupied by Greek  Serbian and Bulgarian forces  The Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of London in May 1913 assigned the whole of Macedonia to the Balkan League  without  specifying the division of the region  to promote problems between the allies  Dissatisfied with the creation of an autonomous Albanian state  which denied her access to the Adriatic  Serbia asked for the suspension of the pre war division treaty and demanded from Bulgaria greater territorial concessions in Macedonia  Later in May the same year  Greece and Serbia signed a secret treaty in Thessaloniki stipulating the division of Macedonia according to the existing lines of control  Both Serbia and Greece  as well as Bulgaria  started to prepare for a final war of partition   In June 1913  Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand  without consulting the government  and without any declaration of war  ordered Bulgarian troops to attack the Greek and Serbian troops in Macedonia  initiating the Second Balkan War  The Bulgarian army was in full retreat in all fronts  The Serbian army chose to stop its operations when achieved all its territorial goals and only then the Bulgarian army took a breath  During the last two days the Bulgarians managed to achieve a defensive victory against the advancing Greek army in the Kresna Gorge  However at the same time the Romanian army crossed the undefended northern border and easily advanced towards Sofia  Romania interfered in the war  in order to satisfy its territorial claims against Bulgaria  The Ottoman Empire also interfered  easily reassuming control of Eastern Thrace with Edirne  The Second Balkan War  also known as Inter Ally War  left Bulgaria only with the Struma valley and a small part of Thrace with minor ports at the Aegean sea  Vardar Macedonia was incorporated into Serbia and thereafter referred to as South Serbia  Southern  Aegean  Macedonia was incorporated into Greece and thereafter was referred to as northern Greece  The region suffered heavily during the Second Balkan War  During its advance at the end of June  the Greek army set fire to the Bulgarian quarter of the town of Kilkis and over 160 villages around Kilkis and Serres driving some 50 000 refugees into Bulgaria proper  The Bulgarian army retaliated by burning the Greek quarter of Serres and by arming Muslims from the region of Drama which led to a massacre of Greek civilians   In September 1915  the Greek government authorized the landing of the troops in Thessaloniki  In 1916 the pro German King of Greece agreed with the Germans to allow military forces of the Central Powers to enter Greek Macedonia to attack Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki  As a result  Bulgarian troops occupied the eastern part of Greek Macedonia  including the port of Kavala  The region was  however  restored to Greece following the victory of the Allies in 1918  After the destruction of the Greek Army in Asia Minor in 1922 Greece and Turkey exchanged most of Macedonia s Turkish minority and the Greek inhabitants of Thrace and Anatolia  as a result of which Aegean Macedonia experienced a large addition to its population and became overwhelmingly Greek in ethnic composition  Serbian ruled Macedonia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia  in 1918  Yugoslav Macedonia was subsequently subjected to an intense process of  Serbianization  during the 1920s and 1930s   During World War II the boundaries of the region shifted yet again  When the German forces occupied the area  most of Yugoslav Macedonia and part of Aegean Macedonia were transferred for administration to Bulgaria  During the Bulgarian administration of Eastern Greek Macedonia  some 100 000 Bulgarian refugees from the region were resettled there and perhaps as many Greeks were deported or fled to Greece  Western Aegean Macedonia was occupied by Italy  with the western parts of Yugoslav Macedonia being annexed to Italian occupied Albania  The remainder of Greek Macedonia  including all of the coast  was occupied by Nazi Germany  One of the worst episodes of the Holocaust happened here when 60 000 Jews from Thessaloniki were deported to extermination camps in occupied Poland  Only a few thousand survived   Macedonia was liberated in 1944  when the Red Army s advance in the Balkan Peninsula forced the German forces to retreat  The pre war borders were restored under U S  and British pressure because the Bulgarian government was insisting to keep its military units on Greek soil  The Bulgarian Macedonia returned fairly rapidly to normality  but the Bulgarian patriots in Yugoslav Macedonia underwent a process of ethnic cleansing by the Belgrade authorities  and Greek Macedonia was ravaged by the Greek Civil War  which broke out in December 1944 and did not end until October 1949   After this civil war  a large number of former ELAS fighters who took refuge in communist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and described themselves as  ethnic Macedonians  were prohibited from reestablishing to their former estates by the Greek authorities  Most of them were accused in Greece for crimes committed during the period of the German occupation   4 9  Macedonia in the Balkan Wars  World War I and II  4 9 1  The Balkan Wars  The imminent collapse of the Ottoman Empire was welcomed by the Balkan states  as it promised to restore their European territory  The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 proved a nationalistic movement thwarting the peoples  expectations of the empire s modernization and hastened the end of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans  To this end  an alliance was struck among the Balkan states in Spring 1913  The First Balkan War  which lasted six weeks  commenced in August 1912  when Montenegro declared war on the Ottoman Empire  whose forces ultimately engaged four different wars in Thrace  Macedonia  Northern and Southern Albania and Kosovo  The Macedonian campaign was fought in atrocious conditions  The retreat of the Ottoman army from Macedonia succeeded the desperate effort of the Greek and Bulgarian forces to reach the city of Thessalonica  the  single prize of the first Balkan War  for whose status no prior agreements were done  In this case possession would be equal to acquisition  The Greek forces entered the city first liberating officially  a progress only positive for them  Glenny says   for the Greeks it was a good war    The first Balkan War managed to liberate Balkans from Turks and settled the major issues except Macedonia  In the spring 1913 the Serbs and Greeks begun the  Serbianization  and the  Hellenization  of the parts in Macedonia they already controlled  while Bulgarians faced some difficulties against the Jews and the Turkish populations  Moreover  the possession of Thessalonica was a living dream for the Bulgarians that were preparing for a new war  For this  the Bulgarian troops had a secret order in June 1913 to launch surprise attacks on the Serbs  Greece and Serbia signed a previous bilateral defensive agreement  May 1913   Consequently  Greece and Serbia decided to attack Bulgaria in its moment of maximum weakness  exhausted by its sacrifice the previous winter  Besides  they had to fight also the Romanians who were claim Bulgarian lands   The Treaty of Bucharest  August 1913  took off most of the Bulgarian conquests of the previous years  Large part of Macedonia became Southern Serbia  including the territory of what today is the Republic of Macedonia and Aegean Macedonia became Northern Greece  Greece almost doubled its territory and population size and its northern frontiers remain today  more or less the same since the Balkan Wars  However  when Serbia acquired  Vardarska Banovina   the present day Republic of Macedonia   it launched having expansionist views aiming to descend to the Aegean  with Thessalonica as the highest ambition  However  Greece after the population exchange with Bulgaria  soon after its victory in the Balkan wars  managed to give national homogeneity in the Aegean and any remaining Slavic speakers were absorbed   Many volunteers from Macedonia joined Bulgarian army and participated in the battles against Bulgarian enemies in these wars—on the strength of the Macedonian Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps and other units   4 9 2  World War I  After World War I Macedonian Campaign the status quo of Macedonia remained the same  The establishment of the  Kingdom of Serbians  Croats and Slovenes  in 1918  which in 1929 was renamed  Yugoslavia   South Slavia  predicted no special regime for Skopje neither recognized any Macedonian national identity  In fact  the claims to Macedonian identity remained silent at a propaganda level because  eventually  north Macedonia had been a Serbian conquest   The situation in Serbian Macedonia changed after the Communist Revolution in Russia  1918–1919   According to Sfetas  Comintern was handling Macedonia as a matter of tactics  depending on the political circumstances  In the early 1920s it supported the position for a single and independent Macedonia in a Balkan Soviet Democracy  Actually  the Soviets desired a common front of the Bulgarian communist agriculturists and the Bulgarian Macedonian societies to destabilize the Balkan Peninsula  The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  IMRO   under the protection of Comintern  promoted the idea of an independent Macedonia in a Federation of Balkan states  unifying all Macedonians  However  the possible participation of Bulgaria in a new war  on the Axis side  ended the Soviet support some years later   4 9 3  World War II  Bulgaria was forced to join the Axis powers in 1941  when German troops prepared to invade Greece from Romania reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through Bulgarian territory  Threatened by direct military confrontation  Tsar Boris III had no choice but to join the fascist block  which officially happened on 1 March 1941  There was little popular opposition  since the Soviet Union was in a non aggression pact with Germany   On 6 April 1941  despite having officially joined the Axis Powers  the Bulgarian government maintained a course of military passivity during the initial stages of the invasion of Yugoslavia and the Battle of Greece  As German  Italian  and Hungarian troops crushed Yugoslavia and Greece  the Bulgarians remained on the sidelines  The Yugoslav government surrendered on 17 April  The Greek government was to hold out until 30 April  On 20 April  the period of Bulgarian passivity ended  The Bulgarian Army entered the Aegean region  The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia and much of eastern Serbia  The so called Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italians which occupied West Macedonia  The Bulgarian occupation of Macedonia was viewed as oppressive by the inhabitants of the region  further distancing any previous affiliations between Macedonian and Bulgarians   During the German occupation of Greece  1941–1944  the Greek Communist Party KKE was the main resistance factor with its military branch EAM ELAS  National Liberation Front   Although many members of EAM were Slavic speaking  they had either Bulgarian  Greek or distinct Macedonian conscience  To take advantage of the situation KKE established SNOF with the cooperation of the Yugoslav leader Tito  who was ambitious enough to make plans for Greek Macedonia  For this he established the Anti Fascistic Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia  ASNOM  giving an actual liberating character to the whole region of Macedonia  Besides  KKE was very positive to the option of a greater Macedonia  including the Greek region  since it realized that a victory in the Greek Civil War was utopic  Later EAM and SNOF disagreed in issues of policy and they finally crashed and the latter was expelled from Greece  1944    4 9 4  Post–World War II  The end of the War did not bring peace to Greece and a strenuous civil war between the Government forces and EAM broke out with about 50 000 casualties for both sides  The defeat of the Communists in 1949 forced their Slav speaking members to either leave Greece or fully adopt Greek language and surnames  The slav minorities were discriminated against  and not even recognised as a minority  Since 1923 the only internationally recognized minority in Greece are the Muslims in Western Thrace   Yugoslav Macedonia was the only region where Yugoslav communist leader Josip Broz Tito had not developed a Partisan movement because of the Bulgarian occupation of a large part of that area  To improve the situation  in 1943 the Communist Party of  Macedonia  was established in Tetovo with the prospect that it would support the resistance against the Axis  In the meantime  the Bulgarians  violent repression led to loss of moral support from the civilian population  By the end of the war  a Macedonia national consciousness hardly existed beyond a general conviction  gained from bitter experience  that rule from Sofia was as unpalatable as that from Belgrade  But if there were no Macedonian nation there was a Communist Party of Macedonia  around which the People s Republic of Macedonia was built    Tito thus separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia after the war  It became a republic of the new federal Yugoslavia  as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia  in 1946  with its capital at Skopje  Tito also promoted the concept of a separate Macedonian nation  as a means of severing the ties of the Slav population of Yugoslav Macedonia with Bulgaria  Although the Macedonian language is very close to Bulgarian  the differences were deliberately emphasized and the region s historical figures were promoted as being uniquely Macedonian  rather than Serbian or Bulgarian   A separate Macedonian Orthodox Church was established  splitting off from the Serbian Orthodox Church  but it has not been recognized by any other Orthodox Church  including the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople  The Communist Party sought to deter pro Bulgarian sentiment  which was punished severely  convictions were still being handed down as late as 1991   Tito had a number of reasons for doing this  First  as an ethnic Croat  he wanted to reduce Serbia s dominance in Yugoslavia  establishing a territory formerly considered Serbian as an equal to Serbia within Yugoslavia achieved this effect  Secondly  he wanted to sever the ties of the Macedonian Slav population with Bulgaria because recognition of that population as Bulgarian would have undermined the unity of the Yugoslav federation  Third of all  Tito sought to justify future Yugoslav claims towards the rest of Macedonia  Pirin and Aegean   in the name of the  liberation  of the region  The potential  Macedonian  state would remain as a constituent republic within Yugoslavia  and so Yugoslavia would manage to get access to the Aegean Sea   Tito s designs on Macedonia were asserted as early as August 1944  when in a proclamation he claimed that his goal was to reunify  all parts of Macedonia  divided in 1912 and 1913 by Balkan imperialists   To this end  he opened negotiations with Bulgaria for a new federal state  which would also probably have included Albania  and supported the Greek Communists in the Greek Civil War  The idea of reunification of all of Macedonia under Communist rule was abandoned as late as 1949 when the Greek Communists lost and Tito fell out with the Soviet Union and pro Soviet Bulgaria   Across the border in Greece  Slavophones were seen as a potentially disloyal  fifth column  within the Greek state by both the US and Greece  and their existence as a minority was officially denied  Greeks were resettled in the region many of whom emigrated  especially to Australia  along with many Greek speaking natives  because of the hard economic conditions after the Second World War and the Greek Civil War  Although there was some liberalization between 1959 and 1967  the Greek military dictatorship re imposed harsh restrictions  The situation gradually eased after Greece s return to democracy  although even as recently as the 1990s Greece has been criticised by international human rights activists for  harassing  Macedonian Slav political activists  who  nonetheless  are free to maintain their own political party  Rainbow   Elsewhere in Greek Macedonia  economic development after the war was brisk and the area rapidly became the most prosperous part of the region  The coast was heavily developed for tourism  particularly on the Halkidiki peninsula   Under Georgi Dimitrov  Soviet loyalist and head of the Comintern  Bulgaria initially accepted the existence of a distinctive Macedonian identity  It had been agreed that Pirin Macedonia would join Yugoslav Macedonia and for this reason the population declared itself  Macedonian  in the 1946 census  This caused resentment and many people were imprisoned or interned in rural areas outside Macedonia  After Tito s split from the Soviet bloc this position was abandoned and the existence of a Macedonian nation or language was denied   Attempts of Macedonian historians after the 1940s to claim a number of prominent figures of the 19th century Bulgarian cultural revival and armed resistance movement as Macedonians has caused ever since a bitter resentment in Sofia  Bulgaria has repeatedly accused the Republic of Macedonia of appropriating Bulgarian national heroes and symbols and of editing works of literature and historical documents so as to prove the existence of a Macedonian Slav consciousness before the 1940s  The publication in the Republic of Macedonia of the folk song collections  Bulgarian Folk Songs  by the Miladinov Brothers and  Songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians  by Serbian archaeologist Verkovic under the  politically correct  titles  Collection  and  Macedonian Folk Songs  are some of the examples quoted by the Bulgarians  The issue has soured the relations of Bulgaria with former Yugoslavia and later with the Republic of Macedonia for decades   5  Foundation of the Republic of Macedonia as an independent state  Kiro Gligorov  the president of Yugoslav Macedonia  sought to keep his republic outside the fray of the Yugoslav wars in the early 1990s  Yugoslav Macedonia s very existence had depended on the active support of the Yugoslav state and Communist Party  As both began to collapse  the Macedonian authorities allowed and encouraged a stronger assertion of Macedonian Slav national identity than before  This included toleration of demands from Macedonian Slav nationalists for the reunification of Macedonia  The Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia were unhappy about an erosion of their national rights in the face of a more assertive Macedonian Slav nationalism  Some nationalist Serbs called for the republic s re incorporation into Serbia  although in practice this was never a likely prospect  given Serbia s preoccupation with the wars in Bosnia and Croatia and the relatively small number of Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia compared to Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina   As communism fell throughout Eastern Europe in the late 20th century  Macedonia followed its other federation partners and declared its independence from Yugoslavia in late 1991  In 1991  the  then Socialist  Republic of Macedonia held a referendum on independence which produced an overwhelming majority in favor of independence  The referendum was boycotted by the ethnic Albanians  although they did create ethnic political parties and actively contributed in the Macedonian government  parliament etc  The republic seceded peacefully from the Yugoslav federation  declaring its independence as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia  Bulgaria was consequently the first country to officially recognize Republic of Macedonia s independence – as early as February 1992  followed by other countries as well  The new Macedonian constitution took effect 20 November 1991 and called for a system of government based on a parliamentary democracy  Kiro Gligorov became the first President of the new independent state  succeeded by Boris Trajkovski  In early January 2001 armed conflict took place between the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army  UÇK  militant group and the Republic of Macedonia s security forces  The conflict partially ended with the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement by the government of the Republic of Macedonia and Albanian representatives on 13 August 2001  which provided for greater rights for Macedonian Albanian population  In January 2002  the Macedonian conflict ended when the amnesty was announced to Albanian irregulars and rebels  Occasional unrest continued throughout 2002   6  Controversy between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece  A controversy exists in regard to whether or not any parts of the historic region of Macedonia are incorporated in the present day Republic of Macedonia  as very little if any of the ancient Macedonian kingdom is  There is also controversy  however  with regard to the Slavic peoples who are concentrated in less than half of the region  They first arrived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD when Slavic speaking populations overturned Macedonia s Greek ethnic composition  As a result  the appropriation by the  Republic of Macedonia  of what Greece held as its  Greek symbols   raised concerns in Greece as well as fuelling nationalist anger  This anger was reinforced by the legacy of the Civil War and the view in some quarters  that members of Greece s Slavic speaking minority were pro Yugoslavian and presented a danger to its borders  The status of the Republic of Macedonia became a heated political issue in Greece where demonstrations took place in Athens while one million Macedonian Greeks took to the streets in Thessaloniki in 1992  under the slogan   Macedonia is Greek   referring to the name and ancient history of the region  not posing a territorial claim against their northern neighbor  Initially  the Greek government objected formally to any use of the name Macedonia  including any derivative names  and also to the use of symbols such as the Vergina Sun  On the other hand  also in 1992  demonstrations by more than 100 000 ethnic Slav Macedonians took place in Skopje  the capital of the Republic of Macedonia  over the failure to receive recognition and supporting the constitutional name of the country   The controversy was not just nationalist  but it also played out in Greece s internal politics  The two leading Greek political parties  the ruling conservative New Democracy under Constantine Mitsotakis and the socialist PASOK under Andreas Papandreou  sought to outbid each other in whipping up nationalist sentiment and the long term  rather than immediate  threat posed by the apparent irredentist policies of Skopje  To complicate matters further  New Democracy itself was divided  the then prime minister  Mitsotakis  favored a compromise solution on the Macedonian question  while his foreign minister Adonis Samaras took a hard line approach  The two eventually fell out and Samaras was sacked  with Mitsotakis reserving the foreign ministry for himself  He failed to reach an agreement on the Macedonian issue despite United Nations mediation  he fell from power in October 1993  largely as a result of Samaras causing the government s majority of one to fall in September 1993   When Andreas Papandreou took power following the October 1993 elections  he established a  hard line  position on the issue  The United Nations recommended recognition of the  Republic of Macedonia  under the temporary name of the  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia   or FYROM for short   which would be used internationally while the country continued to use  Republic of Macedonia  as its constitutional name  The United States and European Union  therefore  including Greece  agreed to this proposal and duly recognized the Republic of Macedonia  This was followed by new  though smaller demonstrations in Greek cities against what was termed a  betrayal  by Greece s allies  Papandreou supported and encouraged the demonstrations  boosting his own popularity by taking the  hard line  against the Republic of Macedonia  In February 1994  he imposed a total trade embargo on the country  with the exception of food  medicines and humanitarian aid  The effect on the Republic of Macedonia s economy was limited  mainly because the real damage to its economy had been caused by the collapse of Yugoslavia and the loss of central European markets due to the war  Also  many Greeks broke the trade embargo by entering through Bulgaria  However  the embargo had bad impact on the Republic of Macedonia s economy as the country was cut off from the port of Thessaloniki and became landlocked because of the UN embargo on Yugoslavia to the north  and the Greek embargo to the south  Later  the signing of the Interim accord between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia marked the increased cooperation between the two neighboring states  The blockade had a political cost for Greece  as there was little understanding or sympathy for the country s position  and exasperation over what was seen as Greek obstructionism from some of its European Union partners  Athens was criticized in some quarters for contributing to the rising tension in the Balkans  even though the wars in the former Yugoslavia were widely seen as having been triggered by the premature recognition of its successor republics  a move to which Greece had objected from the beginning  It later emerged that Greece had only agreed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia in return for EU solidarity on the Macedonian issue  In 1994  the European Commission took Greece to the European Court of Justice in an effort to overturn the embargo  but while the court provisionally ruled in Greece s favor  the embargo was lifted by Athens the following year before a final verdict was reached  This was for the  Republic of Macedonia  and Greece to enter into an  interim agreement  in which the Republic of Macedonia agreed to remove any implied territorial claims to the greater Macedonia region from its constitution and to drop the Vergina Sun from its flag  In return  Greece lifted the blockade   Most of the countries have recognized the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name  notably the United States  the People s Republic of China and Russia  and also its neighbours Bulgaria  Serbia  although as the country is referred in the UN only under the provisional reference the  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia   the constitutional name is generally used only in bilateral relations and in relations where a state not recognizing the constitutional name is not a party   Discussions continue over the Greek objection regarding the country s name  but without any resolution so far  The Greek government have linked progress on this issue to the Republic of Macedonia s accession to the European Union and NATO  for more on this  see Accession of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the European Union    Republic of Macedonia  Croatia and Albania were qualified to join NATO and an invitation for those three countries was planned to be issued on the NATO summit in Bucharest  Romania   in April 2008  Before the beginning of the summit  the American president Bush said that NATO would make a historic decision on the admission of three Balkan nations  Croatia  Albania and Macedonia  and that the United States strongly supported inviting these nations to join NATO  However  during the summit NATO leaders decided not to extend a membership invitation to Macedonia because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue  The Macedonian representative and negotiator with Greece in the name issue complained that the Republic of Macedonia was punished not because it had failed to fulfill NATO accession criteria  but because it had been trying to defend its national identity  The NATO leaders agreed to extend a membership invitation for Macedonia as soon as the name issue with Greece is resolved  but until now no progress has been made in the negotiations between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece to resolve the name issue   In November 2008  Republic of Macedonia filed a lawsuit against Greece before the International Court of Justice in The Hague accusing Athens that it violated the Interim Accord by blocking its NATO membership  In 1995  the two countries signed an agreement by which Macedonia agreed to use the provisional reference in international organizations  while Greece pledged not to block Macedonia s integration into the European Union and NATO   In March 2009 the European Parliament expressed support for the Republic of Macedonia s EU candidacy and asked the EU to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009  regretting that the country is waiting three years after the country was granted a candidate status  which makes a demoralizing effect on Macedonia and brings risks of destabilizing the whole region  The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for the country citizens   7  Controversy between the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria  The number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria is controversial as several Bulgarian censuses showed conflicting numbers of ethnic Macedonians living in that country  As the Bulgarian authorities did not publish the results of the 1946 census regarding the number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria  Yugoslav sources claimed that some 252 000 people declared themselves as Macedonians in that census  Bulgarian embassy in London in 1991 stated that some 169 000 people were recorded as Macedonians on the same census  The census in 1956 registered 187 789 ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria  During this period the Macedonian Language was to be the official language of Pirin Macedonia  In 1992 the number of the ethnic Macedonians was 10 803 and in 2001 only 5 071 citizens declared as ethnic Macedonians  Bulgarian governments and public opinion throughout the period continued their policy of non recognition of Macedonians as a distinct ethnic group  The recent Bulgarian view on the issue is that the Bulgarian policy after the Second World War regarding the Macedonians in Bulgaria was conducted despite the unwillingness of the local population to cooperate  in the conditions of the pressure and reprisals by the Bulgarian communists authorities against the Bulgarians in Pirin Macedonia  After 1958 when the pressure from Moscow decreased  Sofia turned back to the view that the separate Macedonian language did not exist and that the Macedonians in Blagoevgrad province  Pirin Macedonia  were actually Bulgarians   There are several ethnic Macedonian organizations in Bulgaria   Traditional Macedonian Organization Ilinden   later renamed the  IMRO independent – Ilinden   registered in 1992 at the Sofia City Court  Later  in 1998  the organization was registered as a public NGO  The  United Macedonian Organization  UMO  – Ilinden  is another organization  In 1990  the Blagoevgrad District Court refused to register this organization as some parts of the organization statute were not in accordance with the Bulgarian Constitution  In October 1994 this association split up on three different factions  Later two wings were unified under the  UMO Ilinden – PIRIN  organization  In 1998 the European Commission of Human Rights gave admissibility to two out of five complaints of Macedonians from Pirin Macedonia  After the Bulgarian Electoral Committee endorsed in 2001 the registration of a wing of UMO Ilinden  which had dropped separatist demands from its Charter  the mother organization became largely inactive  In 2007  the Sofia City Court refused registration of UMO Ilinden Pirin organization  despite an October 2005 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that a previous ban of the party violated rights to freedom of association and assembly  In November the European Parliament Rapporteur on Bulgaria and the Enlargement Commissioner of the European Commission urged the government to register the organization   There were repeated complaints of official harassment of ethnic Macedonian activists in the 1990s  Attempts of ethnic Macedonian organization UMO Ilinden to commemorate the grave of revolutionary Yane Sandanski throughout the 1990s were usually hampered by the Bulgarian police  Several incidents of mobbing of UMO Ilinden members by Bulgarian Macedonian organization IMRO activists were also reported   There is a newspaper published by the Macedonian organizations in Bulgaria  Narodna Volja   People s Will    which is printed in 2 500 copies   Some cases of harassment of organizations of the Bulgarians in Republic of Macedonia and activists have been reported  In 2000 several teenagers threw smoke bombs at the conference of Bulgarian organization Radko in Skopje  causing panic and confusion among the delegates  The Macedonian Constitutional Court annulled the status and program of the organization  hence terminating its existence   as those documents question the constitutional establishment of Macedonia and creating national and religious hatred and intolerance  Since then  apparently there are very little or not reported public activities of that organization   In 2001 Radko issued in Skopje the original version of the folk song collection Bulgarian Folk Songs by the Miladinov Brothers  issued under an edited name in the Republic of Macedonia and viewed as a collection of Slav Macedonian lyrics   The book triggered a wave of other publications  among which the memoirs of the Greek bishop of Kastoria  in which he talked about the Greek Bulgarian church struggle at the beginning of the 20th century  as well the Report of the Carnegie Commission on the causes and conduct of the Balkan Wars from 1913  Neither of these addressed the ethnic Macedonian population of Macedonia as Macedonians but as Bulgarians  Being the first publications to question the official Macedonian position of the existence of a distinct Macedonian identity going back to the time of Alexander the Great  Macedonism   the books triggered a reaction of shock and disbelief in Macedonian public opinion  The scandal after the publication of Bulgarian Folk Songs resulted in the sacking of the Macedonian Minister of Culture  Dimitar Dimitrov   As of 2000  Bulgaria started to grant Bulgarian citizenship to members of the Bulgarian minorities in a number of countries  including the Republic of Macedonia  The vast majority of the applications have been from Macedonian citizens  As of May 2004  some 14 000 Macedonians had applied for a Bulgarian citizenship on the grounds of Bulgarian origin and 4 000 of them had already received their Bulgarian passports  According to the official Bulgarian sources  in the period between 2000 to 2006 some 30 000 Macedonian citizens applied for Bulgarian citizenship  attracted by the Bulgaria s recent positive development and the opportunity to get European Union passports after Bulgaria joined EU on the beginning of 2007  In 2006 the former Macedonian Premier and chief of IMRO DPMNE Ljubčo Georgievski became a Bulgarian citizen   The rules governing good neighbourly relations agreed between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia were set in the Joint Declaration of 22 February 1999 reaffirmed by a joint memorandum signed on 22 January 2008 in Sofia  There are regular contacts between the Macedonian and Bulgarian officials  confirming the relatively good relationships between the two neighboring countries   Bulgaria has proposed to sign a treaty  based on that 1999 Joint Declaration  guaranteeing the good neighbourly relations between the two countries  to enable Bulgarian support for the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union   8  See also
