Proteins   or   are large biological molecules  or macromolecules  consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues  Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms  including catalyzing metabolic reactions  replicating DNA  responding to stimuli  and transporting molecules from one location to another  Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids  which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes  and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three dimensional structure that determines its activity   A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide  A protein contains at least one long polypeptide  Short polypeptides  containing less than about 20 30 residues  are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides  or sometimes oligopeptides  The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues  The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene  which is encoded in the genetic code  In general  the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids  however  in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine  Shortly after or even during synthesis  the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by posttranslational modification  which alters the physical and chemical properties  folding  stability  activity  and ultimately  the function of the proteins  Sometimes proteins have non peptide groups attached  which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors  Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function  and they often associate to form stable protein complexes   Once formed  proteins only exist for a certain period of time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell s machinery through the process of protein turnover  A protein s lifespan is measured in terms of its half life and covers a wide range  They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells  Abnormal and or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable   Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids  proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells  Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism  Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions  such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton  which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape  Other proteins are important in cell signaling  immune responses  cell adhesion  and the cell cycle  Proteins are also necessary in animals  diets  since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from food  Through the process of digestion  animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids that are then used in metabolism   Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation  precipitation  electrophoresis  and chromatography  the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification  Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry  site directed mutagenesis  X ray crystallography  nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry   1  Biochemistry  Most proteins consist of linear polymers built from series of up to 20 different L α amino acids  All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features  including an α carbon to which an amino group  a carboxyl group  and a variable side chain are bonded  Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N end amine group  which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation  The side chains of the standard amino acids  detailed in the list of standard amino acids  have a great variety of chemical structures and properties  it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity  The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds  Once linked in the protein chain  an individual amino acid is called a residue  and the linked series of carbon  nitrogen  and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone   The peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis  so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar  The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone  The end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C terminus or carboxy terminus  whereas the end with a free amino group is known as the N terminus or amino terminus  The words protein  polypeptide  and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning  Protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation  whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three dimensional structure  However  the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues  Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids  usually regardless of length  but often implies an absence of a defined conformation   2  Synthesis  2 1  Biosynthesis  Proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded in genes  Each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein  The genetic code is a set of three nucleotide sets called codons and each three nucleotide combination designates an amino acid  for example AUG  adenine uracil guanine  is the code for methionine  Because DNA contains four nucleotides  the total number of possible codons is 64  hence  there is some redundancy in the genetic code  with some amino acids specified by more than one codon  Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre messenger RNA  mRNA  by proteins such as RNA polymerase  Most organisms then process the pre mRNA  also known as a primary transcript  using various forms of Post transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA  which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome  In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced  or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid  In contrast  eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm  where protein synthesis then takes place  The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second   The process of synthesizing a protein from an mRNA template is known as translation  The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule  which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes  The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase  charges  the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids  The growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain  Proteins are always biosynthesized from N terminus to C terminus   The size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass  which is normally reported in units of daltons  synonymous with atomic mass units   or the derivative unit kilodalton  kDa   Yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass  The largest known proteins are the titins  a component of the muscle sarcomere  with a molecular mass of almost 3 000 kDa and a total length of almost 27 000 amino acids   2 2  Chemical synthesis  Short proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis  which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield  Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non natural amino acids into polypeptide chains  such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains  These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology  though generally not for commercial applications  Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids  and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure  Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C terminus to N terminus  opposite the biological reaction   3  Structure  Most proteins fold into unique 3 dimensional structures  The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation  Although many proteins can fold unassisted  simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids  others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states  Biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein s structure   Primary structure  the amino acid sequence  A protein is a polyamide   Secondary structure  regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds  The most common examples are the alpha helix  beta sheet and turns  Because secondary structures are local  many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule   Tertiary structure  the overall shape of a single protein molecule  the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another  Tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions  most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core  but also through salt bridges  hydrogen bonds  disulfide bonds  and even posttranslational modifications  The term  tertiary structure  is often used as synonymous with the term fold  The tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein   Quaternary structure  the structure formed by several protein molecules  polypeptide chains   usually called protein subunits in this context  which function as a single protein complex  Proteins are not entirely rigid molecules  In addition to these levels of structure  proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions  In the context of these functional rearrangements  these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as  conformations   and transitions between them are called conformational changes  Such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme s active site  or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis  In solution proteins also undergo variation in structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other molecules   Proteins can be informally divided into three main classes  which correlate with typical tertiary structures  globular proteins  fibrous proteins  and membrane proteins  Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes  Fibrous proteins are often structural  such as collagen  the major component of connective tissue  or keratin  the protein component of hair and nails  Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane   A special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins  poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration  are called dehydrons   3 1  Structure determination  Discovering the tertiary structure of a protein  or the quaternary structure of its complexes  can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function  Common experimental methods of structure determination include X ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy  both of which can produce information at atomic resolution  However  NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated  and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem  Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus  Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal beta sheet  helical composition of proteins  Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower resolution structural information about very large protein complexes  including assembled viruses  a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high resolution information in some cases  especially for two dimensional crystals of membrane proteins  Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank  PDB   a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein   Many more gene sequences are known than protein structures  Further  the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in X ray crystallography  one of the major structure determination methods  In particular  globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X ray crystallography  Membrane proteins  by contrast  are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB  Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes  Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined   4  Cellular functions  Proteins are the chief actors within the cell  said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes  With the exception of certain types of RNA  most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act  Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell  whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%  respectively  The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome   The chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly  The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or  pocket  on the molecular surface  This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein  which defines the binding site pocket  and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids  side chains  Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific  for example  the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub femtomolar dissociation constant   10−15 M  but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase   1 M   Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding  for example  the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine   Proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small molecule substrates  When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule  they can oligomerize to form fibrils  this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self associate to form rigid fibers  Protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity  control progression through the cell cycle  and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function  Proteins can also bind to  or even be integrated into  cell membranes  The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks  Importantly  as interactions between proteins are reversible  and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function  study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function  and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types   4 1  Enzymes  The best known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes  which catalyze chemical reactions  Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions  Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism  as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication  DNA repair  and transcription  Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification  About 4 000 reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes  The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017 fold increase in rate over the uncatalyzed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase  78 million years without the enzyme  18 milliseconds with the enzyme    The molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates  Although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids  it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate  and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis  The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site   Dirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins which dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes   4 2  Cell signaling and ligand binding  Many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction  Some proteins  such as insulin  are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues  Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell  Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell  which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell   Antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens  or foreign substances in the body  and target them for destruction  Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells  Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction  antibodies have no such constraints  An antibody s binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high   Many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism  These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations  but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues  The canonical example of a ligand binding protein is haemoglobin  which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom  Lectins are sugar binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties  Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins  Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins   Transmembrane proteins can also serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions  The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse  Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell  Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion  for example  potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions   4 3  Structural proteins  Structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise fluid biological components  Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins  for example  collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage  and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair  nails  feathers  hooves  and some animal shells  Some globular proteins can also play structural functions  for example  actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers  but polymerize to form long  stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton  which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size   Other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin  kinesin  and dynein  which are capable of generating mechanical forces  These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually  They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport   5  Methods of study  The activities and structures of proteins may be examined in vitro  in vivo  and in silico  In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function  for example  enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme s catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules  By contrast  in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism  In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins   5 1  Protein purification  To perform in vitro analysis  a protein must be purified away from other cellular components  This process usually begins with cell lysis  in which a cell s membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate  The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation  which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins  membrane lipids and proteins  cellular organelles  and nucleic acids  Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate  Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight  net charge and binding affinity  The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known  by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features  or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity  Additionally  proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing   For natural proteins  a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications  To simplify this process  genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity  Here  a  tag  consisting of a specific amino acid sequence  often a series of histidine residues  a  His tag    is attached to one terminus of the protein  As a result  when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel  the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded  A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures   5 2  Cellular localization  The study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell  Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear  A useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a  reporter  such as green fluorescent protein  GFP   The fused protein s position within the cell can be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy  as shown in the figure opposite   Other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER  the Golgi  lysosomes or vacuoles  mitochondria  chloroplasts  plasma membrane  etc  With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers  it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest  For example  indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location  Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose   Other possibilities exist  as well  For example  immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples  allowing for localization information  Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose  or other material  gradients using isopycnic centrifugation  While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest  it does increase the likelihood  and is more amenable to large scale studies   Finally  the gold standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy  This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest  along with classical electron microscopy techniques  The sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination  and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro dense material  usually gold  This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest   Through another genetic engineering application known as site directed mutagenesis  researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure  cellular localization  and susceptibility to regulation  This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins  using modified tRNAs  and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties   5 3  Proteomics  The total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome  and the study of such large scale data sets defines the field of proteomics  named by analogy to the related field of genomics  Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis  which allows the separation of a large number of proteins  mass spectrometry  which allows rapid high throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides  most often after in gel digestion   protein microarrays  which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell  and two hybrid screening  which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions  The total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome  A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics   5 4  Bioinformatics  A vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure  function  and evolution of proteins   The development of such tools has been driven by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms  including the human genome  It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally  hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins  Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment  Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties  Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites  open reading frames in nucleotide sequences  and predict secondary structures  Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express  The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins   5 4 1  Structure prediction and simulation  Complementary to the field of structural genomics  protein structure prediction seeks to develop efficient ways to provide plausible models for proteins whose structures have not yet been determined experimentally  The most successful type of structure prediction  known as homology modeling  relies on the existence of a  template  structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled  structural genomics  goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain  Although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available  it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process  as quite accurate models can be produced if a  perfect  sequence alignment is known  Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering  in which novel protein folds have already been designed  A more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions  such as in molecular docking and protein–protein interaction prediction   The processes of protein folding and binding can be simulated using such technique as molecular mechanics  in particular  molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo  which increasingly take advantage of parallel and distributed computing  Folding@home project  molecular modeling on GPU   The folding of small alpha helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece and the HIV accessory protein have been successfully simulated in silico  and hybrid methods that combine standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics calculations have allowed exploration of the electronic states of rhodopsins   6  Nutrition  Most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids  while animals  including humans  must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet  The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids  Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase  which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of lysine  methionine  and threonine from aspartate  If amino acids are present in the environment  microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways   In animals  amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein  Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion  which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases  Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis  while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis  or fed into the citric acid cycle  This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body s own proteins to be used to support life  particularly those found in muscle  Amino acids are also an important dietary source of nitrogen   7  History and etymology  Proteins were recognized as a distinct class of biological molecules in the eighteenth century by Antoine Fourcroy and others  distinguished by the molecules  ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid  Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites  blood serum albumin  fibrin  and wheat gluten   Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1838  Mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula  C400H620N100O120P1S1  He came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of  very large  molecule  The term  protein  to describe these molecules was proposed by Mulder s associate Berzelius  protein is derived from the Greek word πρώτειος  proteios   meaning  primary    in the lead   or  standing in front   Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a  nearly correct  molecular weight of 131 Da   Early nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body  because it was generally believed that  flesh makes flesh   Karl Heinrich Ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid  At the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by Thomas Burr Osborne  Working with Lafayette Mendel and applying Liebig s law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats  the nutritionally essential amino acids were established  The work was continued and communicated by William Cumming Rose  The understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of Franz Hofmeister and Hermann Emil Fischer  The central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926  when James B  Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein   The difficulty in purifying proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study  Hence  early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities  e g   those of blood  egg white  various toxins  and digestive metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses  In the 1950s  the Armour Hot Dog Co  purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists  this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades  Linus Pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding  an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933  Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation  based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstrøm Lang  contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions   The first protein to be sequenced was insulin  by Frederick Sanger  in 1949  Sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin  thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains  colloids  or cyclols  He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958   The first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin and myoglobin  by Max Perutz and Sir John Cowdery Kendrew  respectively  in 1958    the Protein Data Bank has over 90 000 atomic resolution structures of proteins  In more recent times  cryo electron microscopy of large macromolecular assemblies and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods approaching atomic resolution   8  See also  9  References  10  References  11  External links  11 1  Databases and projects  curates protein–chemical interactions  as well as gene
