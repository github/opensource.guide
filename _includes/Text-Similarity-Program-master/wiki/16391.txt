The Judgement of Paris is a story from Greek mythology  which was one of the events that led up to the Trojan War and  in slightly later versions of the story  to the foundation of Rome   1  Sources of the episode  As with many mythological tales  details vary depending on the source  The brief allusion to the Judgement in the Iliad  24 25舑30  shows that the episode initiating all the subsequent action was already familiar to its audience  a fuller version was told in the Cypria  a lost work of the Epic Cycle  of which only fragments  and a reliable summary  remain  The later writers Ovid  Heroides 16 71ff  149舑152 and 5 35f   Lucian  Dialogues of the Gods 20   The Bibliotheca  Epitome E 3 2  and Hyginus  Fabulae 92   retell the story with skeptical  ironic or popularizing agendas  It appeared wordlessly on the ivory and gold votive chest of the 7th century BC tyrant Cypselus at Olympia  which was described by Pausanias as showing   The subject was favoured by painters of Red figure pottery as early as the sixth century BC  and remained popular in Greek and Roman art  before enjoying a significant revival  as an opportunity to show three female nudes  in the Renaissance   2  Mythic narrative  It is recounted that Zeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis  parents of Achilles   However  Eris  goddess of discord was not invited  for she would have made the party unpleasant for everyone  Angered by this snub  Eris arrived at the celebration with a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides  which she threw into the proceedings  upon which was the inscription καλλίστῃ  kallistēi   for the fairest one     Three goddesses claimed the apple  Hera  Athena and Aphrodite  They asked Zeus to judge which of them was fairest  and eventually he  reluctant to favour any claim himself  declared that Paris  a Trojan mortal  would judge their cases  for he had recently shown his exemplary fairness in a contest in which Ares in bull form had bested Paris s own prize bull  and the shepherd prince had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the god   Thus it happened that  with Hermes as their guide  the three candidates bathed in the spring of Ida  then confronted Paris on Mount Ida in the climactic moment that is the crux of the tale  While Paris inspected them  each attempted with her powers to bribe him  Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia  Athena offered wisdom and skill in war  and Aphrodite  who had the Charites and the Horai to enhance her charms with flowers and song  according to a fragment of the Cypria quoted by Athenagoras of Athens   offered the world s most beautiful woman  Euripides  Andromache  l 284  Helena l  676   This was Helen of Sparta  wife of the Greek king Menelaus  Paris accepted Aphrodite s gift and awarded the apple to her  receiving Helen as well as the enmity of the Greeks and especially of Hera  The Greeks  expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War   The mytheme of the Judgement of Paris naturally offered artists the opportunity to depict a sort of beauty contest between three beautiful female nudes  but the myth  at least since Euripides  rather concerns a choice among the gifts that each goddess embodies  The bribery involved is ironic and a late ingredient   According to a tradition suggested by Alfred J  Van Windekens  objectively   cow eyed  Hera was indeed the most beautiful  not Aphrodite  However  Hera was the goddess of the marital order and of cuckolded wives  amongst other things  She was often portrayed as the shrewish  jealous wife of Zeus  who himself often escaped from her controlling ways by cheating on her with other women  mortal and immortal  She had fidelity and chastity in mind and was careful to be modest when Paris was inspecting her  Aphrodite  though not as objectively beautiful as Hera  was the goddess of sexuality  and was effortlessly more sexual and charming before him  Thus  she was able to sway Paris into judging her the fairest  Athena s beauty is rarely commented in the myths  perhaps because Greeks held her up as an asexual being  being able to  overcome  her  womanly weaknesses  to become both wise and talented in war  both considered male domains by the Greeks   Her rage at losing makes her join the Greeks in the battle against Paris  Trojans  a key event in the turning point of the war   3  In post Classical art  The subject became popular in art from the late Middle Ages onwards  All three goddesses were usually shown nude  though in ancient art only Aphrodite is ever unclothed  and not always  The opportunity for three female nudes was a large part of the attraction of the subject  It appeared in illuminated manuscripts and was popular in decorative art  including 15th century Italian inkstands and other works in maiolica  and cassoni  As a subject for easel paintings  it was more common in Northern Europe  although Marcantonio Raimondi s engraving of c  1515  probably based on a drawing by Raphael  and using a composition derived from a Roman sarcophagus  was a highly influential treatment  which made Paris s Phrygian cap an attribute in most later versions   The subject was painted many  supposedly 22  times by Lucas Cranach the Elder  and was especially attractive to Northern Mannerist painters  Rubens painted several compositions of the subject at different points in his career  Watteau and Angelica Kauffman were among the artists who painted the subject in the 18th century  The Judgement of Paris was painted frequently by academic artists of the 19th century  and less often by their more progressive contemporaries such as Renoir and Cézanne  Later artists who have painted the subject include André Lhote  Enrique Simonet  El Juicio de Paris 1904  and Salvador Dalí   Ivo Saliger  1939   Adolf Ziegler  1939  and Joseph Thorak  1941  also used the classic myth to propagate German renewal during the nazi regime   4  Gallery  4 1  Paintings  File Histoires de Troyes  Jugdement of Paris jpeg Miniature  c  1495 File Lucas Cranach d  Ä    The Judgment of Paris   WGA05629 jpg  Lucas Cranach

is the word of the Ancient Greek language inscribed on the Golden Apple of Discord by Eris  In Greek  the word is καλλίστῃ  the dative singular of the feminine superlative of καλος  beautiful   Its meaning can be rendered  to the fairest one    Calliste  Καλλίστη  Mod  Gk  Kallisti  is also an ancient name for the isle of Thera   6  Use in Discordianism  The word Kallisti  Modern Greek  written on a golden apple  has become a principal symbol of Discordianism  a post modernist religion  In non philological texts  such as Discordian ones  the word is usually spelled as καλλιστι  Most versions of Principia Discordia actually spell it as καλλιχτι  but this is definitely incorrect  in the afterword of the 1979 Loompanics edition of Principia  Gregory Hill says that was because on the IBM typewriter he used  not all Greek letters coincided with Latin ones  and he didn t know enough of the letters to spot the mistake  Zeus  failure to invite Eris is referred to as The Original Snub in Discordian mythology   7  Dramatizations  The story is the basis of an opera  The Judgement of Paris  with a libretto by William Congreve  that was set to music by four composers in London  1700 1701  Thomas Arne composed a highly successful score to the same libretto in 1742  The opera Le Cinesi  The Chinese Women  by Christoph Willibald Gluck  1754  concludes with a ballet  The Judgement of Paris  sung as a vocal quartet  Francesco Cilea s 1902 opera Adriana Lecouvreur also includes a Judgement of Paris ballet sequence   Novelist Gore Vidal named his 1952 book  The Judgment of Paris  after this story   The Judgement of Paris was burlesqued in the 1954 musical The Golden Apple  In it  the three goddesses have been reduced to three town biddies in smalltown Washington state  They ask Paris  a traveling salesman  to judge the cakes they have made for the church social  Each woman  the mayor s wife  the schoolmarm  and the matchmaker  makes appeals to Paris  who chooses the matchmaker  The matchmaker  in turn  sets him up with Helen  the town floozy  who runs off with him   The Judgement of Paris is featured in the 2003 TV miniseries Helen of Troy  The event is brief  and only Hera and Aphrodite offer bribes  All three goddesses remain fully clothed  Aphrodite gives Paris a vision of Helen  while Helen has a reciprocal vision of Paris   In the Hercules  The Legendary Journeys series  the contest is altered somewhat with Aphrodite and Athena entering but Artemis is the third goddess contestant instead of Hera  offering the one who chooses her the chance to be renowned as a great warrior   The Golden Apple appears as a gift from Aphrodite with the ability to make any mortal woman fall in love with the man holding it and to make a mortal man and woman soul mates if they simultaneously touch it  The other major differences beside the presence of Artemis and the role of the apple are the fact that it is Iolaus who is the judge and the goddesses appear in swimsuits and not nude   8  See also  Trojan War  9  Notes  10  References  Malcolm Bull  The Mirror of the Gods  How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods  Oxford UP  2005  ISBN 0
