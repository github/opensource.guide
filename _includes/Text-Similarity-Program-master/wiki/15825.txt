John Ernst Steinbeck  Jr   February 27  1902 – December 20  1968  was an American author of twenty seven books  including sixteen novels  six non fiction books  and five collections of short stories  He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat  1935  and Cannery Row  1945   the multi generation epic East of Eden  1952   and the novellas Of Mice and Men  1937  and The Red Pony  1937   The Pulitzer Prize winning The Grapes of Wrath  1939   widely attributed to be part of the American literary canon  is considered Steinbeck s masterpiece  In the first 75 years since it was published  it sold 14 million copies   The winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature  he has been called  a giant of American letters   His works are widely read abroad and many of his works are considered classics of Western literature  His leftist political tendencies and the relatively provincial setting of his works has made him a very polarizing writer  both in the United States and in international literary circles  Until recently  the mandated teaching of his works in the British educational system has been controversial   Most of Steinbeck s work is set in southern and central California  particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region  His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice  especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists   1  Early life  John Ernst Steinbeck  Jr  was born on February 27  1902  in Salinas  California  He was of German  English  and Irish descent  Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck  Steinbeck s paternal grandfather  had shortened the family name to Steinbeck when he emigrated to the United States  The family farm in Heiligenhaus  Mettmann  North Rhine Westphalia  Germany  is still today named  Großsteinbeck    His father  John Ernst Steinbeck  served as Monterey County treasurer  John s mother  Olive Hamilton  a former school teacher  shared Steinbeck s passion for reading and writing  The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church  although Steinbeck would later become an agnostic  Steinbeck lived in a small rural town  no more than a frontier settlement  set in some of the world s most fertile land  He spent his summers working on nearby ranches and later with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms  There he became aware of the harsher aspects of migrant life and the darker side of human nature  which supplied him with material expressed in such works as Of Mice and Men  He also explored his surroundings  walking across local forests  fields  and farms  While working at Spreckels Sugar Company  he would sometimes work in their laboratory  which gave him time to write  He also had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for making his own repairs to things he owned   Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went from there to study English Literature at Stanford University in Palo Alto  leaving  without a degree  in 1925  He travelled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write  When he failed to have his work published  he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at Lake Tahoe  where he met Carol Henning  his first wife  The two were married in January 1930 in Los Angeles  where  with friends  he attempted to make money manufacturing plaster mannequins   When their money ran out six months later  Steinbeck and Carol moved back to Pacific Grove  California  to a cottage owned by his father  on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks from the border of the city of Monterey  California  The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing  paper for his manuscripts  and from 1928  loans that allowed him to write without looking for work  During this period of the Great Depression  Steinbeck bought a small boat  and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea  as well as fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms  When that didn t work  Steinbeck and his wife were not above getting welfare  or rarely even stealing bacon from the local produce market  Whatever food they had  they would share with their friends  Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck s novel Cannery Row   In 1930  Steinbeck met Ed Ricketts  who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology  Ricketts  usually very quiet  yet likable  with an inner self sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects  became a focus of Steinbeck s attention  Ricketts had taken a college class from Warder C  Allee  a biologist and ecological theorist  who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology  Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking  in which man was only one part of a great chain of being  caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand  Meanwhile  Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey  selling biological samples of small animals  fish  rays  starfish  turtles  and other marine forms to schools and colleges   Between the years 1930 to 1936  Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends  Steinbeck s wife began working at the lab as secretary bookkeeper  Steinbeck himself began helping out on an informal basis  They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art  and John learned biology and Ricketts  ecological philosophy  When Steinbeck had emotional upsets  Ricketts would sometimes play music for him   2  Career  2 1  Writing  Steinbeck s first novel  Cup of Gold  published in 1929  is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan  It centers on Morgan s assault and sacking of the city of Panama  sometimes referred to as the  Cup of Gold   and on the women  fairer than the sun  who were said to be found there   After Cup of Gold  between 1930 and 1933 Steinbeck produced three shorter works  The Pastures of Heaven  published in 1932  consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey  which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves  In 1933 Steinbeck published The Red Pony  a 100 page  four chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck s childhood  To a God Unknown  named after a Vedic hymn  follows the life of a homesteader and his family in California  depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works  Although he still had not achieved the status of a well known writer  he never doubted that he would achieve greatness   Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with Tortilla Flat  1935   a novel set in post war Monterey  California  that won the California Commonwealth Club s Gold Medal  It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I  just before U S  prohibition  They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life centered around wine  lust  camaraderie and petty theft  In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck  the Swedish Academy cited  spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos  asocial individuals who  in their wild revels  are almost caricatures of King Arthur s Knights of the Round Table  It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression   Tortilla Flat was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name  starring Spencer Tracy  Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield  a friend of Steinbeck s  With some of the proceeds he built a summer ranch home in Los Gatos   Steinbeck began to write a series of  California novels  and Dust Bowl fiction  set among common people during the Great Depression  These included In Dubious Battle  Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath   Of Mice and Men was a drama about the dreams of a pair of migrant agricultural laborers in California  It was critically acclaimed and Steinbeck s 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a  little masterpiece   Its stage production was a hit  starring Wallace Ford as George and starring Broderick Crawford as George s companion   the mentally childlike but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie  Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run  telling director George S  Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind was  perfect  and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment  Steinbeck would write two more stage plays  The Moon Is Down and Burning Bright    Of Mice and Men was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film  with Lon Chaney  Jr  as Lennie  he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production  and Burgess Meredith as George  Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades  Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie   Steinbeck followed this wave of success with The Grapes of Wrath  1939   based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco  It is commonly considered his greatest work  According to The New York Times  it was the best selling book of 1939 and 430 000 copies had been printed by February 1940  In that month it won the National Book Award  favorite fiction book of 1939  voted by members of the American Booksellers Association  Later that year it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and it was adapted as a film directed by John Ford  starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad  Fonda was nominated for the best actor Academy Award   Grapes was controversial  Steinbeck s New Deal political views  negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism  and sympathy for the plight of workers  led to a backlash against the author  especially close to home  Claiming the book was both obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county  the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county s publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939  This ban lasted until January 1941   Of the controversy  Steinbeck wrote   The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad  The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them  I m frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing  It is completely out of hand  I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy    The film versions of The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men  by two different movie studios  were in production simultaneously  allowing Steinbeck to spend a full day on the set of The Grapes of Wrath and the next day on the set of Of Mice and Men   2 2  Ed Ricketts  In the 1930s and 1940s  Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck s writing  Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens  which Ricketts sold for a living  Their joint book about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940  which was part travelogue and part natural history  published just as the U S  entered World War II  never found an audience and did not sell well  However  in 1951  Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as The Log from the Sea of Cortez  under his name only  though Ricketts had written some of it   This work remains in print today   Although Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip  their marriage was beginning to suffer  and ended a year later  in 1941  even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book  In 1942  after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn  Gwyn  Conger  With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons—Thomas   Thom   Myles Steinbeck  born 1944  and John Steinbeck IV  1946–1991    Ricketts was Steinbeck s model for the character of  Doc  in Cannery Row  1945  and Sweet Thursday  1954    Friend Ed  in Burning Bright  and characters in In Dubious Battle  1936  and The Grapes of Wrath  1939   Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck s novels of the period   Steinbeck s close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol  Ricketts  biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that  except for East of Eden  1952   Steinbeck s writing declined after Ricketts  untimely death in 1948   2 3  1940s–1960s work  Steinbeck s novel The Moon Is Down  1942   about the Socrates inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe  was made into a film almost immediately  It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and the occupiers the Nazis  and in 1945 Steinbeck received the Haakon VII Cross of freedom for his literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement   In 1943  Steinbeck served as a World War II war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and worked with the Office of Strategic Services  predecessor of the CIA   It was at that time he became friends with Will Lang  Jr  of Time Life magazine  During the war  Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks  Jr  s Beach Jumpers program  which launched small unit diversion operations against German held islands in the Mediterranean  At one point  he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and helped capture Italian and German prisoners  using a Tommy Gun  Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary Once There Was a War  1958    Steinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma  He treated himself  as ever  by writing  He wrote Alfred Hitchcock s Lifeboat  1944   and the film A Medal for Benny  1945  with screenwriter Jack Wagner about paisanos from Tortilla Flat going to war  He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of Lifeboat because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones  In 1944  suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove Monterey life of the 1930s  he wrote Cannery Row  1945  which became so famous that Ocean View Avenue in Monterey  the location of the book  was eventually renamed Cannery Row in 1958   After the end of the war  he wrote The Pearl  1947   already knowing it would be filmed  The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of Woman s Home Companion magazine as  The Pearl of the World   It was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell  The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940  as related in The Log From the Sea of Cortez  which he described in Chapter 11 as being  so much like a parable that it almost can t be   Steinbeck traveled to Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script  on this trip he would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata  and subsequently wrote a film script  Viva Zapata   directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn   In 1947  Steinbeck made the first of many trips to the Soviet Union  this one with photographer Robert Capa  They visited Moscow  Kiev  Tbilisi  Batumi and Stalingrad  some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution  Steinbeck s 1948 book about their experiences  A Russian Journal  was illustrated with Capa s photos  In 1948  the year the book was published  Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters   In 1952 Steinbeck s longest novel  East of Eden  was published  According to his third wife  Elaine  he considered it his magnum opus  his greatest novel   In 1952  John Steinbeck appeared as the on screen narrator of 20th Century Fox s film  O  Henry s Full House  Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera  he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O  Henry  About the same time  Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records  despite some stiffness  the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck s deep  resonant voice   Following the success of Viva Zapata   Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on East of Eden  James Dean s film debut   Travels with Charley  subtitle  In Search of America  is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley  Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots  while dispensing both criticism and praise for America  According to Steinbeck s son Thom  Steinbeck went on the trip because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time   Steinbeck s last novel  The Winter of Our Discontent  1961   examines moral decline in America  The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him  The book is very different in tone from Steinbeck s amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row  It was not a critical success  Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel but were disappointed that it was not another Grapes of Wrath  In the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year  however  the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably   Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath  Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American  be it good or bad    Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel  and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962  Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death   2 4  Nobel Prize  In 1962  Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his  realistic and imaginative writing  combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception   The selection was heavily criticized  and described as  one of the Academy s biggest mistakes  in one Swedish newspaper  The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh  The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose  limited talent is  in his best books  watered down by tenth rate philosophising   noting that   T he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing      W e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer     whose significance  influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age   Steinbeck himself  when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel  replied   Frankly  no   Biographer Jackson Benson notes    T his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver  It was precisely because the committee made its judgment     on its own criteria  rather than plugging into  the main currents of American writing  as defined by the critical establishment  that the award had value   In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm  he said   In 2012   50 years later   the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a  compromise choice  among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck  British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell  French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen  The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot   There aren t any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation   wrote committee member Henry Olsson  Although the committee believed Steinbeck s best work was behind him by 1962  committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his new novel The Winter of Our Discontent in 1961 showed that  after some signs of slowing down in recent years   Steinbeck has  regained his position as a social truth teller  and is an  authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway    Although modest about his own talent as a writer  Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers  In 1953  he wrote that he considered cartoonist Al Capp  creator of the satirical Li l Abner   possibly the best writer in the world today   At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied   Hemingway s short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote    In September 1964  Steinbeck was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B  Johnson   In 1967  at the behest of Newsday magazine  Steinbeck went to Vietnam to report on the war there  Thinking of the Vietnam War as a heroic venture  he was considered a hawk for his position on that war  His sons both served in Vietnam prior to his death  and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield  at one point being allowed to man a machine gun watch position at night at a firebase  while his son and other members of his platoon slept    3  Personal life  In May 1948  Steinbeck went back to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts  who had been seriously injured when his car was struck by a train  Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived  Upon returning home  Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn  who asked for a divorce  which became final in August  Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts  death in deep depression   In June 1949  Steinbeck met stage manager Elaine Scott at a restaurant in Carmel  California  Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship and in December 1950 Steinbeck and Scott married  within a week of the finalizing of Scott s own divorce from actor Zachary Scott  This third  and final  marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968   In 1966  Steinbeck traveled to Tel Aviv to visit the site of Mount Hope  a farm community established in Israel by his grandfather  whose brother  Friedrich Grosssteinbeck  was murdered by Arab marauders in 1858 in what became known as the Outrages at Jaffa   4  Death and legacy  John Steinbeck died in New York City on December 20  1968  of heart disease and congestive heart failure  He was 66  and had been a lifelong smoker  An autopsy showed nearly complete occlusion of the main coronary arteries   In accordance with his wishes  his body was cremated  and interred on March 4  1969 at the Hamilton family gravesite in Salinas  with those of his parents and maternal grandparents  His third wife  Elaine  was buried in the plot in 2004  He had earlier written to his doctor that he felt deeply  in his flesh  that he would not survive his physical death  and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it   The day after Steinbeck s death in New York City  reviewer Charles Poore wrote in the New York Times   John Steinbeck s first great book was his last great book  But Good Lord  what a book that was and is  The Grapes of Wrath   Poore noted a  preachiness  in Steinbeck s work   as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of Mark Twain— and the other half from the worst of Cotton Mather   But he asserted that  Steinbeck didn t need the Nobel Prize— the Nobel judges needed him    Steinbeck s incomplete novel based on the King Arthur legends of Malory and others  The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights  was published in 1976   Many of Steinbeck s works are on required reading lists in American high schools  In the United Kingdom  Of Mice and Men is one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE  A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that Of Mice and Men was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools   At the same time  The Grapes of Wrath has been banned by school boards  in August 1939  Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county s publicly funded schools and libraries  It was burned in Salinas on two different occasions  In 2003  a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity  According to the American Library Association Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004  with Of Mice and Men ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States   4 1  Opinions on Nobel Prize  The award of the 1962 Nobel Prize for Literature to Steinbeck was controversial in the United States  The award citation lauded Steinbeck  for his realistic and imaginative writings  combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception   Many critics of the award of the Nobel to Steinbeck complained that the author s best work were behind him  The New York Times ran an article by Arthur Mizener entitled “Does a Writer with a Moral Vision of the 1930s Deserve the Nobel Prize ” that claimed Steinbeck was undeserving of the prestigious prize as he was a “limited talent” whose works were “watered down by tenth rate philosophizing   Many American critics now consider these attacks to be politically motivated   The British newspaper The Guardian  in a 2013 article that revealed that Steinbeck had been a compromise choice for the Nobel Prize  called him a  Giant of American Letters   Despite ongoing attacks on his literary reputation  Steinbeck s works continue to sell well and he is widely taught in American and British schools as a bridge to more complex literature  Works such as Of Mice and Men are short and easy to read  and compassionately illustrate universal themes that are still relevant in the 21st Century   4 2  Literary influences  Steinbeck grew up in California s Salinas Valley  a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history  This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing  giving many of his works a distinct sense of place  Salinas  Monterey and parts of the San Joaquin Valley were the setting for many of his stories  The area is now sometimes referred to as  Steinbeck Country   Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years  An exception was his first novel  Cup of Gold  which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan  whose adventures had captured Steinbeck s imagination as a child   In his subsequent novels  Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California  His childhood friend  Max Wagner  a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor  served as inspiration for The Red Pony  Later he used real American historical conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century  which he had experienced first hand as a reporter  Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters  his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression   His later work reflected his wide range of interests  including marine biology  politics  religion  history and mythology  One of his last published works was Travels with Charley  a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America   4 3  Commemoration  Steinbeck s boyhood home  a turreted Victorian building in downtown Salinas  has been preserved and restored by the Valley Guild  a nonprofit organization  Fixed menu lunches are served Monday through Saturday  and the house is open for tours during the summer on Sunday afternoons   The National Steinbeck Center  two blocks away at 1 Main Street is the only museum in the U S  dedicated to a single author  Dana Gioia  chair of the National Endowment for the Arts  told an audience at the center   This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country  and I ve seen them all   Its  Steinbeckiana  includes  Rocinante   the camper truck in which Steinbeck made the cross country trip described in Travels with Charley   His father s cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove  where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books  also survives   In Monterey  Ed Ricketts  laboratory survives  though it is not yet open to the public  and at the corner which Steinbeck describes in Cannery Row  also the store which once belonged to Lee Chong  and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hobos of Cannery Row  The site of the Hovden Sardine Cannery next to Doc s laboratory is now occupied by the Monterey Bay Aquarium  However  the street that Steinbeck described as  Cannery Row  in the novel  once named Ocean View Avenue  was renamed Cannery Row in honor of the novel  in 1958  The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck s work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from Cannery Row  historical plaques  and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts   On February 27  1979  the 77th anniversary of the writer s birth   the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck  starting the Postal Service’s Literary Arts series honoring American writers   On December 5  2007  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Steinbeck into the California Hall of Fame  located at the California Museum for History  Women and the Arts  His son  author Thomas Steinbeck  accepted the award on his behalf   To commemorate the 112th anniversary of Mr  Steinbeck s birthday on February 27  2014  Google displayed an interactive doodle utilizing animation which included illustrations portraying scenes and quotes from several novels by the author   5  Political views  Steinbeck s contacts with leftist authors  journalists  and labor union figures may have influenced his writing and he joined the League of American Writers  a Communist organization  in 1935  Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter  Through Francis Whitaker  a member of the Communist Party USA’s John Reed Club for writers  Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the Cannery and Agricultural Workers  Industrial Union  In 1939  he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Soviet established puppet government   Documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952  while planning a European tour  and the Director of Central Intelligence himself  Walter Bedell Smith  was eager to take him up on the offer  What work  if any  Steinbeck may have performed for the CIA during the Cold War is unknown   Steinbeck was a close associate of playwright Arthur Miller  In June 1957  Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by standing up for him when Miller refused to name names in the House Un American Activities Committee trials  Steinbeck called the period one of the  strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced    In 1967  when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the war  his sympathetic portrayal of the United States Army led the New York Post to denounce him for betraying his liberal past  Steinbeck s biographer  Jay Parini  says Steinbeck s friendship with President Lyndon B  Johnson influenced his views on Vietnam  Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam   5 1  Government harassment  Steinbeck complained publicly about government harassment  Thomas Steinbeck  the author s eldest son  said that J  Edgar Hoover  director of the FBI at the time  could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the U S  Internal Revenue Service to audit Steinbeck s taxes every single year of his life  just to annoy him  According to Thomas  a true artist is one who  without a thought for self  stands up against the stones of condemnation  and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice  or the halls of government  By doing so these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo    In a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General Francis Biddle  John Steinbeck wrote   Do you suppose you could ask Edgar s boys to stop stepping on my heels  They think I am an enemy alien  It is getting tiresome   The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation   6  Major works  6 1  In Dubious Battle  In 1936  Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dustbowl trilogy  which included Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath  This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers  strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of  the Party   generally taken to be the Communist Party  although this is never spelled out in the book   6 2  Of Mice and Men  Of Mice and Men is a tragedy that was written in the form of a play in 1937  The story is about two traveling ranch workers  George and Lennie  trying to work up enough money to buy their own farm ranch  As it is set in 1930s America  it provides an insight into The Great Depression  encompassing themes of racism  loneliness  prejudice against the mentally ill  and the struggle for personal independence  Along with The Grapes of Wrath  East of Eden  The Pearl  and Of Mice and Men is one of Steinbeck s best known works  It was made into a movie three times  in 1939 starring Burgess Meredith  Lon Chaney Jr   and Betty Field  in 1982 starring Randy Quaid  Robert Blake and Ted Neeley  and in 1992 starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich   6 3  The Grapes of Wrath  The Grapes of Wrath is set in the Great Depression and describes a family of sharecroppers  the Joads  who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the Dust Bowl  The title is a reference to the Battle Hymn of the Republic  Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers  plight and too critical of capitalism but it found quite a large audience in the working class  It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction  novels  and was adapted as a film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford   6 4  East of Eden  Steinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this Salinas Valley saga  The story follows two families  the Hamiltons – based on Steinbeck s own maternal ancestry – and the Trasks  reprising stories about the Biblical Adam and his progeny  The book was published in 1952  It was made into a movie in 1955 directed by Elia Kazan starring James Dean   6 5  Travels with Charley  In 1960  Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom built camper top – which was rare at the time – and drove across the United States with his faithful  blue
