Pope Urban VI    c  1318 – 15 October 1389   born Bartolomeo Prignano     was Pope from 8 April 1378 to his death in 1389  He was the last Pope to be elected from outside the College of Cardinals   1  Early life  Born in Itri  Prignano was a devout monk and learned casuist  trained at Avignon  On 21 March 1364 he was consecrated Archbishop of Acerenza in the Kingdom of Naples  He became Archbishop of Bari in 1377   Prignano had developed a reputation for simplicity and frugality and a head for business when acting Vice Chancellor  He also demonstrated a penchant for learning  and  according to Cristoforo di Piacenza  he was without famiglia in an age of nepotism  although once in the papal chair he elevated four cardinal nephews and sought to place one of them in control of Naples  His great faults undid his virtues  Ludwig Pastor summed up his character   He lacked Christian gentleness and charity  He was naturally arbitrary and extremely violent and imprudent  and when he came to deal with the burning ecclesiastical question of the day  that of reform  the consequences were disastrous    2  Election as Pope  On the death of Pope Gregory XI in 1378  a Roman mob surrounded the papal conclave to demand a Roman pope  The cardinals being under some haste and great pressure to avoid the return of the Papal seat to Avignon  Prignano was unanimously chosen Pope on 8 April 1378 as acceptable to the disunited majority of French cardinals  taking the name Urban VI  Not being a Cardinal  he was not well known  Immediately following the conclave  most of the cardinals fled Rome before the mob could learn that not a Roman  though not a Frenchman either   but a subject of Queen Joan I of Naples  had been chosen   Though the coronation was carried out in scrupulous detail  leaving no doubt as to the legitimacy of the new pontiff  the French were not particularly happy with this move and began immediately to conspire against this Pope  Urban VI did himself no favors  whereas the cardinals had expected him pliant  he was considered arrogant and angry by many of his contemporaries  Dietrich of Nieheim reported the opinion of the cardinals that his elevation had turned his head  and Froissart  Leonardo Aretino  Tommaso de Acerno and St  Antoninus of Florence recorded similar conclusions   3  Crisis of control  Immediately following his election  Urban began preaching intemperately to the cardinals  some of whom thought the delirium of power had made Urban mad and unfit for rule   insisting that the business of the Curia should be carried on without gratuities and gifts  forbidding the cardinals to accept annuities from rulers and other lay persons  condemning the luxury of their lives and retinues  and the multiplication of benefices and bishoprics in their hands  Nor would he remove again to Avignon  thus alienating King Charles V of France   The cardinals were mortally offended  Five months after his election  the French cardinals met at Anagni  inviting Urban  who realized that he would be seized and perhaps slain  In his absence they issued a manifesto of grievances on 9 August that declared his election invalid since they had been cowed by the mob into electing an Italian  Letters to the missing Italian cardinals followed on 20 August declaring the papal throne vacant  sede vacante   Then at Fondi  secretly supported by the king of France  the French cardinals proceeded to elect Robert of Geneva as Pope on 20 September  Robert  a militant cleric who had succeeded Albornoz as commander of the papal troops  took the title of Clement VII  beginning the Western Schism  which divided Catholic Christendom until 1417   Urban was declared excommunicated by the French antipope and was called  the Antichrist   while Catherine of Siena  defending Pope Urban  called the cardinals  devils in human form   Coluccio Salutati identified the political nature of the withdrawal   Who does not see   the Chancellor openly addressed the French cardinals   that you seek not the true pope  but opt solely for a Gallic pontiff   Opening rounds of argument were embodied in John of Legnano s defense of the election  De fletu ecclesiæ  written and incrementally revised between 1378 and 1380  which Urban caused to be distributed in multiple copies  and in the numerous rebuttals that soon appeared  Events overtook the rhetoric  however  26 new cardinals were created in a single day  and by an arbitrary alienation of the estates and property of the church  funds were raised for open war  At the end of May 1379 Clement went to Avignon  where he was more than ever at the mercy of the king of France  Louis I  Duke of Anjou  was granted a phantom kingdom of Adria to be carved out of papal Emilia and Romagna  if he could unseat the pope at Rome   4  War of the Eight Saints  Meanwhile the War of the Eight Saints  carried on with spates of unprecedented cruelty to civilians  was draining the resources of Florence  though the city ignored the interdict placed upon it by Gregory  declared its churches open  and sold ecclesiastical property for 100 000 florins to finance the war  Bologna had submitted to the Church in August 1377  and Florence signed a treaty at Tivoli on 28 July 1378 at a cost of 200 000 florins indemnity extorted by Urban for the restitution of church properties  receiving in return the papal favor and the lifting of the disregarded interdict   Urban s erstwhile patroness  Queen Joan I of Naples  deserted him in the late summer of 1378  in part because her former archbishop had become her feudal suzerain  Urban now lost sight of the larger issues and began to commit a series of errors  He turned upon his powerful neighbor Joan  excommunicated her as an obstinate partisan of Clement  and permitted a crusade to be preached against her  Soon her enemy and cousin  the  crafty and ambitious  Charles of Durazzo  representing the Sicilian Angevin line  was made sovereign over the Kingdom of Naples on 1 June 1381   and was crowned by Urban  Joan s authority was declared forfeit  and Charles murdered her in 1382   In return for these favours  Charles had to promise to hand over Capua  Caserta  Aversa  Nocera  and Amalfi to the pope s nephew  a thoroughly worthless and immoral man   Once ensconced at Naples  Charles found his new kingdom invaded by Louis of Anjou and Amadeus VI of Savoy  hard pressed  he reneged on his promises  In Rome  the Castel Sant Angelo was besieged and taken  and Urban was forced to flee  In the fall of 1383 he was determined to go to Naples and press Charles in person  There he found himself virtually a prisoner  After a first reconciliation  with the death of Louis  20 September 1384   Charles found himself freer to resist Urban s feudal pretensions  and relations took a turn for the worse  Urban was shut up in Nocera  from the walls of which he daily fulminated his anathemas against his besiegers  with bell  book and candle  a price was set on his head   Rescued by two Neapolitan barons who had sided for Louis  Raimondello Orsini and Tommaso di Sanseverino  after six months of siege he succeeded in making his escape to Genoa with six galleys sent him by doge Antoniotto Adorno  Several among his cardinals who had been shut up in Nocera with him and had followed him in Genoa determined to make a stand  they determined that a Pope  who by his incapacity or blind obstinacy might be put in the charge of one of the cardinals  Urban had them seized  tortured and put to death   a crime unheard of through the centuries  the chronicler Egidio da Viterbo remarked   Urban s support had dwindled to the northern Italian states  Portugal  England  and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV  who brought with him the support of most of the princes and abbots of Germany   On the death of Charles of Naples on 24 February 1386  Urban moved to Lucca in December of the same year  The Kingdom of Naples was contended between a party favouring his son Ladislaus and Louis II of Anjou  Urban contrived to take advantage of the anarchy which had ensued  as well as of the presence of the feeble Maria as Queen of Sicily  to seize Naples for his nephew Francesco Moricotti Prignani  In the meantime he was able to have Viterbo and Perugia return to the Papal control   5  Injury and death  In August 1388 Urban moved from Perugia with thousands of troops  To raise funds he had proclaimed a Jubilee to be held in 1390  At the time of the proclamation  only 38 years had elapsed since the previous Jubilee  which was celebrated under Clement VI  During the march  Urban fell from his mule at Narni and had to recover in early October in Rome  where he was able to oust the communal rule of the banderesi and restore the Papal authority  He died soon afterwards  likely of injuries caused by the fall  but not without rumors of poisoning  It is noteworthy that during the reconstruction of Saint Peter s Basilica  Urban s remains were almost dumped out to be destroyed so his sarcophagus could be used to water horses  The sarcophagus was saved only when church historian Giacomo Grimaldi arrived and  realizing its importance  ordered it preserved   Pope Urban VI s successor was Pope Boniface IX   6  Notes  7  References  8  External links   Urban VI
