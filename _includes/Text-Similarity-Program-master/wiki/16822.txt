The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade  The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years  from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession  Acre  was destroyed by the Mamluks  but its history is divided into two distinct periods  The first kingdom lasted from 1099 to 1187  when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin  After the subsequent Third Crusade  the kingdom was re established in Acre in 1192  and lasted until that city s destruction in 1291  This second kingdom is sometimes called the Kingdom of Acre   1  Geographic boundaries  At first the kingdom was little more than a loose collection of towns and cities captured during the crusade  but at its height in the mid 12th century the kingdom roughly encompassed the territory of modern day Israel  Palestine and the southern parts of Lebanon  From the Mediterranean Sea  the kingdom extended in a thin strip of land from Beirut in the north to the Sinai Desert in the south  into modern Jordan and Syria in the east  and towards Fatimid Egypt in the west  Three other crusader states founded during and after the First Crusade were located further north  the County of Edessa  1097–1144   the Principality of Antioch  1098–1268   and the County of Tripoli  1109–1289   While all three were independent  they were closely tied to Jerusalem  Beyond these to the north and east lay the states of Armenian Cilicia and the Byzantine Empire  with which Jerusalem had a close relationship in the twelfth century  Further east  various Muslim emirates were located which were ultimately allied with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad  The fragmentation of the Muslim east allowed for the initial success of the crusade  but as the 12th century progressed  the kingdom s Muslim neighbours were united by Nur ad Din Zangi and Saladin  who vigorously began to recapture lost territory  Jerusalem itself fell to Saladin in 1187  and in the 13th century the kingdom was reduced to a few cities along the Mediterranean coast  In this period  the kingdom was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty of the Kingdom of Cyprus  another crusader state founded during the Third Crusade  Dynastic ties also strengthened with Tripoli  Antioch  and Armenia  The kingdom was soon increasingly dominated by the Italian city states of Venice and Genoa  as well as the imperial ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperors  Emperor Frederick II  reigned 1220 1250  claimed the kingdom by marriage  but his presence sparked a civil war  1228 1243  among the kingdom s nobility  The kingdom became little more than a pawn in the politics and warfare of the Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties in Egypt  as well as the Khwarezmian and Mongol invaders  As a relatively minor kingdom  it received little financial or military support from Europe  despite numerous small expeditions  Europeans generally proved unwilling to undertake an expensive journey to the east for an apparently losing cause  The Mamluk sultans Baibars  reigned 1260 1277  and al Ashraf Khalil  reigned 1290 1293  eventually reconquered all the remaining crusader strongholds  culminating in the destruction of Acre in 1291   2  People  The kingdom was ethnically  religiously  and linguistically diverse  although the crusaders themselves and their descendants were an elite Catholic minority  They imported many customs and institutions from their homelands in Western Europe  and there were close familial and political connections with the West throughout the kingdom s existence  The kingdom also inherited  oriental  qualities  influenced by the pre existing customs and populations  The majority of the kingdom s inhabitants were native Christians  especially Greek and Syrian Orthodox  as well as Sunni and Shi a Muslims  There were also a small number of Jews and Samaritans  The native Christians and Muslims  who were a marginalized lower class  tended to speak Greek and Arabic  while the crusaders spoke Latin  French  and other Western European languages   3  History  3 1  The First Crusade and the foundation of the kingdom  The First Crusade was preached at the Council of Clermont in 1095 by Pope Urban II  with the goal of assisting the Byzantine Empire against the invasions of the Seljuk Turks  However  the main objective quickly became the control of the Holy Land  The Byzantines were frequently at war with the Seljuqs and other Turkish dynasties for control of Anatolia and Syria  The Sunni Seljuqs had formerly ruled the Great Seljuq Empire  but this empire had collapsed into several smaller states after the death of Malik Shah I in 1092  Malik Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian Sultanate of Rûm by Kilij Arslan I  and in Syria by his brother Tutush I  who died in 1095  Tutush s sons Fakhr al Mulk Radwan and Duqaq inherited Aleppo and Damascus respectively  further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other  as well as Kerbogha  the atabeg of Mosul  This disunity among the Anatolian and Syrian emirs allowed the crusaders to overcome any military opposition they faced on the way to Jerusalem   Egypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the Arab Shi ite Fatimid Caliphate  which had extended further into Syria before the arrival of the Seljuqs  Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims  The Fatimids  under the nominal rule of caliph al Musta li but actually controlled by vizier al Afdal Shahanshah  had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073  they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids  a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs  just before the arrival of the crusaders   The crusaders arrived at Jerusalem in June 1099  a few of the neighbouring towns  Ramla  Lydda  Bethlehem  and others  were taken first  and Jerusalem itself was captured on July 15  On 22 July  a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to establish a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem  Raymond IV of Toulouse and Godfrey of Bouillon were recognized as the leaders of the crusade and the siege of Jerusalem  Raymond was the wealthier and more powerful of the two  but at first he refused to become king  perhaps attempting to show his piety and probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway  The more popular Godfrey did not hesitate like Raymond  and accepted a position as secular leader  Although it is widely claimed that he took the title Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri   advocate  or  defender  of the Holy Sepulchre   this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey  Instead  Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term princeps  or simply retained his title of dux from Lower Lorraine  According to William of Tyre  writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey had become a legendary hero  he refused to wear  a crown of gold  where Christ had worn  a crown of thorns   Robert the Monk is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title  king   Raymond was incensed and took his army to forage away from the city  The new kingdom  and Godfrey s reputation  was secured with the defeat of the Fatimid Egyptian army under al Afdal Shahanshah at the Battle of Ascalon one month after the conquest  on August 12  but Raymond and Godfrey s continued antagonism prevented the crusaders from taking control of Ascalon itself   There was still some uncertainty about what to do with the new kingdom  The papal legate Daimbert of Pisa convinced Godfrey to hand over Jerusalem to him as Latin Patriarch  with the intention to set up a theocratic state directly under papal control  According to William of Tyre  Godfrey may have supported Daimbert s efforts  and he agreed to take possession of  one or two other cities and thus enlarge the kingdom  if Daimbert were permitted to rule Jerusalem  Godfrey did indeed increase the boundaries of the kingdom  by capturing Jaffa  Haifa  Tiberias  and other cities  and reducing many others to tributary status  He set the foundations for the system of vassalage in the kingdom  establishing the Principality of Galilee and the County of Jaffa  But his reign was short  and he died of an illness in 1100  His brother Baldwin of Boulogne successfully outmanoeuvred Daimbert and claimed Jerusalem for himself as  king of the Latins of Jerusalem   Daimbert compromised by crowning Baldwin in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem  but the path for a secular state had been laid  Within this secular framework  a Catholic church hierarchy was established  overtop of the local Eastern Orthodox and Syrian Orthodox authorities  who retained their own hierarchies  the Catholics considered them schismatics and thus illegitimate  and vice versa   Under the Latin Patriarch there were four suffragan archdioceses and numerous dioceses   3 2  Expansion  During Baldwin I s reign the kingdom expanded even further  The numbers of Latin inhabitants increased  as the minor crusade of 1101 brought reinforcements to the kingdom  Baldwin repopulated Jerusalem with Franks and native Christians  after his expedition across the Jordan in 1115  With help from the Italian city states and other adventurers  notably King Sigurd I of Norway  Baldwin captured the port cities of Acre  1104   Beirut  1110   and Sidon  1111   while exerting his suzerainty over the other crusader states to the north – Edessa  which he had founded in 1097 during the crusade   Antioch  and Tripoli  which he helped capture in 1109  He successfully defended against Muslim invasions  from the Fatimids at the numerous battles at Ramla and elsewhere in the southwest of the kingdom  and from Damascus and Mosul at the Battle of al Sannabra in the northeast in 1113  As Thomas Madden says  Baldwin was  the true founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem   who  had transformed a tenuous arrangement into a solid feudal state  With brilliance and diligence  he established a strong monarchy  conquered the Palestinian coast  reconciled the crusader barons  and built strong frontiers against the kingdom s Muslim neighbours   Baldwin brought with him an Armenian wife  traditionally named Arda  although never named such by contemporaries   whom he had married to gain political support from the Armenian population in Edessa  and whom he quickly set aside when he no longer needed Armenian support in Jerusalem  He bigamously married Adelaide del Vasto  regent of Sicily  in 1113  but was convinced to divorce her as well in 1117  Adelaide s son from her first marriage  Roger II of Sicily  never forgave Jerusalem  and for decades withheld much needed Sicilian naval support   Baldwin died without heirs in 1118  during a campaign against Egypt  and the kingdom was offered to his brother Eustace III of Boulogne  who had accompanied Baldwin and Godfrey on the crusade  Eustace was uninterested  and instead the crown passed to Baldwin s relative  probably a cousin  Baldwin of Le Bourg  who had previously succeeded him in Edessa  Baldwin II was an able ruler  and he too successfully defended against Fatimid and Seljuk invasions  Although Antioch was severely weakened after the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119  and Baldwin himself was held captive by the emir of Aleppo from 1122–1124  Baldwin led the crusader states to victory at the Battle of Azaz in 1125  His reign saw the establishment of the first military orders  the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar  the earliest surviving written laws of the kingdom  compiled at the Council of Nablus in 1120  and the first commercial treaty with Venice  the Pactum Warmundi  in 1124  The increase of naval and military support from Venice led to the capture of Tyre that year  The influence of Jerusalem was further extended over Edessa and Antioch  where Baldwin II acted as regent when their own leaders were killed in battle  although there were regency governments in Jerusalem as well during Baldwin s captivity  Baldwin was married to the Armenian noblewoman Morphia of Melitene  and had four daughters  Hodierna and Alice  who married into the families of the Count of Tripoli and Prince of Antioch  Ioveta  who became an influential abbess  and the eldest  Melisende  who was his heir and succeeded him upon his death in 1131  with her husband Fulk V of Anjou as king consort  Their son  the future Baldwin III  was named co heir by his grandfather   3 3  Edessa  Damascus  and the Second Crusade  Fulk was an experienced crusader  who had brought military support to the kingdom during a pilgrimage in 1120  He brought Jerusalem into the sphere of the Angevin Empire  as the father of Geoffrey V of Anjou and grandfather of the future Henry II of England  Not everyone appreciated the imposition of a foreigner as king  In 1132 Antioch  Tripoli  and Edessa all asserted their independence and conspired to prevent Fulk from exercising the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them  He defeated Tripoli in battle  and settled the regency in Antioch by arranging a marriage between the countess  Melisende s niece Constance  and his own relative Raymond of Poitiers  Meanwhile  in Jerusalem  the native crusader nobles opposed Fulk s preference for his Angevin retinue  In 1134 Hugh II of Jaffa revolted against Fulk  allying with the Muslim garrison at Ascalon  for which he was convicted of treason in absentia  The Latin Patriarch intervened to settle the dispute  but an assassination attempt was then made on Hugh  for which Fulk was blamed  This scandal allowed Melisende and her supporters to gain control of the government  just as her father had intended  Accordingly  Fulk  became so uxorious that   not even in unimportant cases did he take any measures without her knowledge and assistance    Fulk was then faced with a new and more dangerous enemy  the atabeg Zengi of Mosul  who had taken control of Aleppo and had set his sights on Damascus as well  the union of these three states would have been a serious blow to the growing power of Jerusalem  A brief intervention in 1137–1138 by the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus  who wished to assert imperial suzerainty over all the crusader states  did nothing to stop the threat of Zengi  in 1139 Damascus and Jerusalem recognized the severity of the threat to both states  and an alliance was concluded which halted Zengi s advance  Fulk used this time to construct numerous castles  including Ibelin and Kerak  After the death of both Fulk and Emperor John in separate hunting accidents in 1143  Zengi invaded and conquered Edessa in 1144  Queen Melisende  now regent for her elder son Baldwin III  appointed a new constable  Manasses of Hierges  to head the army after Fulk s death  but Edessa could not be recaptured  despite Zengi s own assassination in 1146  The fall of Edessa shocked Europe  and a Second Crusade arrived in 1148   After meeting in Acre in June  the crusading kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany agreed with Melisende  Baldwin III and the major nobles of the kingdom to attack Damascus  Zengi s territory had been divided amongst his sons after his death  and Damascus no longer felt threatened  so an alliance had been made with Zengi s son Nur ad Din  the emir of Aleppo  Perhaps remembering attacks launched on Jerusalem from Damascus in previous decades  Damascus seemed to be the best target for the crusade  rather than Aleppo or another city to the north which would have allowed for the recapture of Edessa  The subsequent Siege of Damascus was a complete failure  when the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse  the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls  and were driven back  The crusaders retreated within three days  There were rumours of treachery and bribery  and Conrad III felt betrayed by the nobility of Jerusalem  Whatever the reason for the failure  the French and German armies returned home  and a few years later Damascus was firmly under Nur ad Din s control   3 4  Civil war  The failure of the Second Crusade had dire long term consequences for the kingdom  The West was hesitant to send large scale expeditions  for the next few decades  only small armies came  headed by minor European nobles who desired to make a pilgrimage  The Muslim states of Syria were meanwhile gradually united by Nur ad Din  who defeated the Principality of Antioch at the Battle of Inab in 1149 and gained control of Damascus in 1154  Nur ad Din was extremely pious and during his rule the concept of jihad came to be interpreted as a kind of counter crusade against the kingdom  which was an impediment to Muslim unity  both political and spiritual   In Jerusalem  the crusaders were distracted by a conflict between Melisende and Baldwin III  Melisende continued to rule as regent long after Baldwin came of age  She was supported by  among others  Manasses of Hierges  who essentially governed for her as constable  her son Amalric  whom she set up as Count of Jaffa  Philip of Milly  and the Ibelin family  Baldwin asserted his independence by mediating disputes in Antioch and Tripoli  and gained the support of the Ibelin brothers when they began to oppose Manasses  growing power  thanks to his marriage to their widowed mother Helvis of Ramla  In 1153 Baldwin had himself crowned as sole ruler  and a compromise was reached by which the kingdom was divided in two  with Baldwin taking Acre and Tyre in the north and Melisende remaining in control of Jerusalem and the cities of the south  Baldwin was able to replace Manasses with one of his own supporters  Humphrey II of Toron  Baldwin and Melisende knew that this situation was untenable  Baldwin soon invaded his mother s possessions  defeated Manasses  and besieged his mother in the Tower of David in Jerusalem  Melisende surrendered and retired to Nablus  but Baldwin appointed her his regent and chief advisor  and she retained some of her influence  especially in appointing ecclesiastical officials  In 1153  Baldwin launched an offensive against Ascalon  the fortress in the south from which Fatimid Egyptian armies had continually raided Jerusalem since the foundation of the kingdom  The fortress was captured and was added to the County of Jaffa  still in the possession of his brother Amalric   3 5  Byzantine alliance and invasion of Egypt  With the capture of Ascalon the southern border of the kingdom was now secure  and Egypt  formerly a major threat to the kingdom but now destabilized under the reign of several underaged caliphs  was reduced to a tributary state  Nur ad Din remained a threat in the east  and Baldwin had to contend with the advances of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus  who claimed suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch  In order to bolster the defences of the kingdom against the growing strength of the Muslims  Baldwin III made the first direct alliance with the Byzantine Empire  by marrying Theodora Comnena  a niece of emperor Manuel  Manuel married Baldwin s cousin Maria  As William of Tyre put it  it was hoped that Manuel would be able  to relieve from his own abundance the distress under which our realm was suffering and to change our poverty into superabundance    When Baldwin died childless in 1162  a year after his mother Melisende  the kingdom passed to his brother Amalric  who renewed the alliance negotiated by Baldwin  In 1163 the chaotic situation in Egypt led to a refusal to pay tribute to Jerusalem  and requests were sent to Nur ad Din for assistance  in response  Amalric invaded  but was turned back when the Egyptians flooded the Nile at Bilbeis  The Egyptian vizier Shawar again requested help from Nur ad Din  who sent his general Shirkuh  but Shawar quickly turned against him and allied with Amalric  Amalric and Shirkuh both besieged Bilbeis in 1164  but both withdrew due to Nur ad Din s campaigns against Antioch  where Bohemond III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli were defeated at the Battle of Harim  It seemed likely that Antioch itself would fall to Nur ad Din  but he withdrew when Emperor Manuel sent a large Byzantine force to the area  Nur ad Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt in 1166  and Shawar again allied with Amalric  who was defeated at the Battle of al Babein  Despite the defeat  both sides withdrew  but Shawar remained in control with a crusader garrison in Cairo  Amalric cemented his alliance with Manuel by marrying Manuel s niece Maria Komnene in 1167  and an embassy led by William of Tyre was sent to Constantinople to negotiate a military expedition  but in 1168 Amalric pillaged Bilbeis without waiting for the naval support promised by Manuel  Amalric accomplished nothing else  but his actions prompted Shawar to switch sides again and seek help from Shirkuh  Shawar was promptly assassinated  and when Shirkuh died in 1169  he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf  better known as Saladin  That year  Manuel sent a large Byzantine fleet of some 300 ships to assist Amalric  and the town of Damietta was placed under siege  However  the Byzantine fleet sailed with enough provisions for only three months  By the time that the crusaders were ready supplies were already running out and the fleet retired  Each side sought to blame the other for the failure  but both knew that they could not take Egypt without the other s assistance  the alliance was maintained  and plans for another campaign in Egypt were made  which ultimately were to come to naught   In the end  Nur ad Din was victorious and Saladin established himself as Sultan of Egypt  Saladin soon began to assert his independence from Nur ad Din  and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad Din in 1174  he was well placed to begin exerting control over Nur ad Din s Syrian possessions as well  Upon the death of the pro western Emperor Manuel in 1180  the Kingdom of Jerusalem lost its most powerful ally   3 6  Baldwin IV and the succession crisis  Amalric was succeeded by his young son  Baldwin IV  who was discovered at a very young age to be a leper  The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions  the  court party   made up of Baldwin s mother  Amalric s first wife Agnes of Courtenay  her immediate family  and recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and who were in favour of war with Saladin  and the  noble party   led by Raymond of Tripoli and the lesser nobility of the kingdom  who favoured peaceful co existence with the Muslims  This is the interpretation offered by William of Tyre  who was firmly placed in the  noble  camp  and his view was taken up by subsequent historians  in the 20th century  Marshall W  Baldwin  Steven Runciman  and Hans E  Mayer favoured this interpretation  Peter W  Edbury  on the other hand  argues that William  as well as the thirteenth century authors who continued William s chronicle in French and were allied to Raymond s supporters in the Ibelin family  cannot be considered impartial  Although the events were clearly a dynastic struggle   the division was not between native barons and newcomers from the West  but between the king s maternal and paternal kin    Miles of Plancy was briefly bailli or regent during Baldwin IV s minority  Miles was assassinated in October 1174  and Count Raymond III of Tripoli  Amalric s first cousin  became regent  It is highly probable that Raymond or his supporters engineered the assassination  Baldwin reached his majority in 1176  and despite his illness he no longer had any legal need for a regent  Since Raymond was his nearest relative in the male line with a strong claim to the throne  there was concern about the extent of his ambitions  although he had no direct heirs of his own  To balance this  the king turned from time to time to his uncle  Joscelin III of Edessa  who was appointed seneschal in 1176  Joscelin was more closely related to Baldwin than Raymond was  but had no claim to the throne himself   As a leper  Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer  so the focus of his succession passed to his sister Sibylla and his younger half sister Isabella  Baldwin and his advisors recognised that it was essential for Sibylla to be married to a Western nobleman in order to access support from Europe in a military crisis  while Raymond was still regent  a marriage was arranged for Sibylla and William of Montferrat  a cousin of Louis VII of France and of Frederick Barbarossa  Holy Roman Emperor  It was hoped that by allying with a relative of the western emperor  Frederick would come to the kingdom s aid  Jerusalem looked again towards the Byzantine Empire for help  and Emperor Manuel was looking for a way to restore his empire s prestige after his defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176  this mission was undertaken by Raynald of Châtillon  After William of Montferrat arrived in 1176  he fell ill and died in June 1177  leaving Sibylla widowed and pregnant with the future Baldwin V  Raynald was then named regent   Soon afterwards  Philip of Flanders arrived in Jerusalem on pilgrimage  he was Baldwin IV s cousin  and the king offered him the regency and command of the army  both of which Philip refused  although he objected to the appointment of Raynald as regent  Philip then attempted to intervene in the negotiations for Sibylla s second husband  and suggested one of his own retinue  but the native barons refused his suggestion  In addition  Philip seemed to think he could carve out a territory of his own in Egypt  but he refused to participate with the planned Byzantine Jerusalem expedition  The expedition was delayed and finally cancelled  and Philip took his army away to the north   Most of the army of Jerusalem marched north with Philip  Raymond III  and Bohemond III to attack Hama  and Saladin took the opportunity to invade the kingdom  Baldwin proved to be an effective and energetic king as well as being a brilliant military commander  he defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard in September 1177 despite being greatly outnumbered and having to rely on a levee en masse  Although Baldwin s presence despite his illness was inspirational  direct military decisions were actually made by Raynald   Hugh III of Burgundy was expected to come to Jerusalem and marry Sibylla  but Hugh was unable to leave France due to the political unrest there in 1179–1180 following the death of Louis VII  Meanwhile  Baldwin IV s stepmother Maria  mother of Isabella and stepmother of Sibylla  married Balian of Ibelin  At Easter in 1180  Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Balian s brother Baldwin of Ibelin  Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin s nearest male relatives in the paternal line  and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement  Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived  Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer  Guy of Lusignan  whose older brother Amalric of Lusignan was already an established figure at court  Internationally  the Lusignans were useful as vassals of Baldwin and Sibylla s cousin Henry II of England  Baldwin betrothed eight year old Isabella to Humphrey IV of Toron  stepson of the powerful Raynald of Châtillon  thereby removing her from the influence of the Ibelin family and that of her mother   The dispute between the two factions in the kingdom affected the election of a new Patriarch in 1180  When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180  the two most obvious choices for his successor were William of Tyre and Heraclius of Caesarea  They were fairly evenly matched in background and education  but politically they were allied with opposite parties  as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay s supporters  The canons of the Holy Sepulchre asked the king for advice  and Heraclius was chosen through Agnes  influence  There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers  but this information comes from the partisan 13th century continuations of William of Tyre s history  and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim   At the end of 1181  Raynald of Châtillon raided south into Arabia  in the direction of Medina  although he did not make it that far  It was probably around this time that Raynald also attacked a Muslim caravan  The kingdom had a truce with Saladin at the time  and Raynald s actions have been seen as an independent act of brigandage  it is possible that he was trying to prevent Saladin from moving his forces north to take control of Aleppo  which would have strengthened Saladin s position  In response  Saladin attacked the kingdom in 1182  but was defeated at Belvoir Castle  King Baldwin  although quite ill  was still able to command the army in person  Saladin attempted to besiege Beirut from land and sea  and Baldwin raided Damascene territory  but neither side did significant damage  In December 1182  Raynald launched a naval expedition on the Red Sea  which made it as far south as Rabigh  The expedition was defeated and two of Raynald s men were actually taken to Mecca to be executed in public  Like his earlier raids  Raynald s expedition is usually seen as selfish and ultimately fatal for Jerusalem  but according to Bernard Hamilton it was actually shrewd strategy  meant to damage Saladin s prestige and reputation   In 1183 a general tax was levied throughout the kingdom  which was unprecedented in Jerusalem and almost all of medieval Europe to that point  The tax helped pay for larger armies for the next few years  More troops were certainly needed  since Saladin was finally able to gain control of Aleppo  and with peace in his northern territories he could focus on Jerusalem in the south  King Baldwin was so incapacitated by his leprosy that it was necessary to appoint a regent  and Guy of Lusignan was chosen  as he was Baldwin s legal heir and the king was not expected to live  The inexperienced Guy led the Frankish army against Saladin s incursions into the kingdom  but neither side made any real gains  and Guy was criticized by his opponents for not striking against Saladin when he had the chance   In October 1183 Isabella married Humphrey of Toron at Kerak  during a siege by Saladin  who perhaps hoped to take some valuable prisoners  As King Baldwin  although now blind and crippled  had recovered enough to resume his reign and his command of the army  Guy was removed from the regency and his five year old step son  King Baldwin s nephew and namesake Baldwin  was crowned as co king in November  King Baldwin himself then went to relieve the castle  carried on a litter  and attended by his mother  He was reconciled with Raymond of Tripoli and appointed him military commander  The siege was lifted in December and Saladin retreated to Damascus  Saladin attempted another siege in 1184  but Baldwin repelled that attack as well  and Saladin raided Nablus and other towns on the way home   In October 1184  Guy of Lusignan led an attack on the Bedouin nomads from his base in Ascalon  Unlike Raynald s attacks on caravans  which may have had some military purpose  Guy attacked a group that was usually loyal to Jerusalem and provided intelligence about the movements of Saladin s troops  At the same time  King Baldwin contracted his final illness and Raymond of Tripoli  rather than Guy  was appointed as his regent  His nephew Baldwin was paraded in public  wearing his crown as Baldwin V  Baldwin IV finally succumbed to his leprosy in May 1185   Meanwhile  the succession crisis had prompted a mission to the west to seek assistance  In 1184  Patriarch Heraclius travelled throughout the courts of Europe  but no help was forthcoming  Heraclius offered the  keys of the Holy Sepulchre  those of the Tower of David and the banner of the Kingdom of Jerusalem   but not the crown itself  to both Philip II of France and Henry II of England  the latter  as a grandson of Fulk  was a first cousin of the royal family of Jerusalem  and had promised to go on crusade after the murder of Thomas Becket  Both kings preferred to remain at home to defend their own territories  rather than act as regent for a child in Jerusalem  The few European knights who did travel to Jerusalem did not even see any combat  since the truce with Saladin had been re established  William V of Montferrat was one of the few who came to his grandson Baldwin V s aid   Baldwin V s rule  with Raymond of Tripoli as regent and his great uncle Joscelin of Edessa as his guardian  was short  He was a sickly child and died in the summer of 1186  Raymond and his supporters went to Nablus  presumably in an attempt to prevent Sibylla from claiming the throne  but Sibylla and her supporters went to Jerusalem  where it was decided that the kingdom should pass to her  on the condition that her marriage to Guy be annulled  She agreed but only if she could choose her own husband and king  and after being crowned  she immediately crowned Guy with her own hands  Raymond had refused to attend the coronation  and in Nablus he suggested that Isabella and Humphrey should be crowned instead  but Humphrey refused to agree to this plan which would have certainly started a civil war  Humphrey went to Jerusalem and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla  as did most of Raymond s other supporters  Raymond himself refused to do so and left for Tripoli  Baldwin of Ibelin also refused  gave up his fiefs  and left for Antioch   3 7  Loss of Jerusalem and the Third Crusade  Raymond of Tripoli allied with Saladin against Guy and allowed a Muslim garrison to occupy his fief in Tiberias  probably hoping that Saladin would help him overthrow Guy  Saladin  meanwhile  had pacified his Mesopotamian territories  and was now eager to attack the crusader kingdom  he did not intend to renew the truce when it expired in 1187  Before the truce expired  Raynald of Chatillon  the lord of Oultrejourdain and of Kerak and one of Guy s chief supporters  recognized that Saladin was massing his troops  and attacked Muslim caravans in an attempt to disrupt this  Guy was on the verge of attacking Raymond  but realized that the kingdom would need to be united in the face of the threat from Saladin  and Balian of Ibelin effected a reconciliation between the two during Easter in 1187  Saladin attacked Kerak again in April  and in May  a Muslim raiding party ran into the much smaller embassy on its way to negotiate with Raymond  and defeated it at the Battle of Cresson near Nazareth  Raymond and Guy finally agreed to attack Saladin at Tiberias  but could not agree on a plan  Raymond thought a pitched battle should be avoided  but Guy probably remembered the criticism he faced for avoiding battle in 1183  and it was decided to march out against Saladin directly  On July 4  1187  the army of the kingdom was utterly destroyed at the Battle of Hattin  Raymond of Tripoli  Balian of Ibelin  and Reginald of Sidon escaped  but Raynald was executed by Saladin and Guy was imprisoned in Damascus   Over the next few months Saladin easily overran the entire kingdom  Only the port of Tyre remained in Frankish hands  defended by Conrad of Montferrat  the paternal uncle of Baldwin V  who had coincidentally arrived just in time from Constantinople  The fall of Jerusalem essentially ended the first Kingdom of Jerusalem  Much of the population  swollen with refugees fleeing Saladin s conquest of the surrounding territory  was allowed to flee to Tyre  Tripoli  or Egypt  whence they were sent back to Europe   but those who could not pay for their freedom were sold into slavery  and those who could were often robbed by Christians and Muslims alike on their way into exile  The capture of the city led to the Third Crusade  launched in 1189 and led by Richard the Lionheart  Philip Augustus and Frederick Barbarossa  though the last drowned en route   Guy of Lusignan  who had been refused entry to Tyre by Conrad  began to besiege Acre in 1189  During the lengthy siege  which lasted until 1191  Patriarch Heraclius  Queen Sibylla and her daughters  and many others died of disease  With the death of Sibylla in 1190  Guy now had no legal claim to the kingship  and the succession passed to Sibylla s half sister Isabella  Isabella s mother Maria and the Ibelins  now closely allied to Conrad  argued that Isabella and Humphrey s marriage was illegal  as she had been underage at the time  underlying this was the fact that Humphrey had betrayed his wife s cause in 1186  The marriage was annulled amid some controversy  Conrad  who was now the nearest kinsman to Baldwin V in the male line  and had already proved himself a capable military leader  then married Isabella  but Guy refused to concede the crown   When Richard arrived in 1191  he and Philip took different sides in the succession dispute  Richard backed Guy  his vassal from Poitou  while Philip supported Conrad  a cousin of his late father Louis VII  After much ill feeling and ill health  Philip returned home in 1191  soon after the fall of Acre  Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192  recovering most of the coast  but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom  It has been suggested that this may have actually been a strategic decision by Richard rather than a failure as such  as he may have recognized that Jerusalem in particular was in fact a strategic liability as long as the crusaders were obligated to defend it  as it was isolated from the sea where Western reinforcements could arrive  Conrad was unanimously elected king in April 1192  but was murdered by the Hashshashin only days later  Eight days after that  the pregnant Isabella was married to Count Henry II of Champagne  nephew of Richard and Philip  but politically allied to Richard  As compensation  Richard sold Guy the island of Cyprus  which Richard had captured on the way to Acre  although Guy continued to claim the throne of Jerusalem until his death in 1194   The crusade came to an end peacefully  with the Treaty of Ramla negotiated in 1192  Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem  allowing the crusaders to fulfill their vows  after which they all returned home  The native crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities   3 8  The Kingdom of Acre  For the next hundred years  the Kingdom of Jerusalem clung to life as a tiny kingdom hugging the Syrian coastline  Its capital was moved to Acre and controlled most of the coastline of present day Israel and southern and central Lebanon  including the strongholds and towns of Jaffa  Arsuf  Caesarea  Tyre  Sidon  and Beirut  At best  it included only a few other significant cities  such as Ascalon and some interior fortresses  as well as suzerainty over Tripoli and Antioch  The new king  Henry of Champagne  died accidentally in 1197  and Isabella married for a fourth time  to Aimery of Lusignan  Guy s brother  Aimery had already inherited Cyprus from Guy  and had been crowned king by Frederick Barbarossa s son  Emperor Henry VI  Henry led a crusade in 1197 but died along the way  Nevertheless  his troops recaptured Beirut and Sidon for the kingdom before returning home in 1198  A five year truce was then concluded with the Ayyubids in Syria in 1198   The Ayyubid empire had fallen into civil war after the death of Saladin in 1193  His sons claimed various parts of his empire  az Zahir took control of Aleppo  al Aziz Uthman held Cairo  while his eldest son  al Afdal  retained Damascus  Saladin s brother Al Adil Sayf ad Din  often called  Saphadin  by the crusaders  acquired al Jazira  northern Mesopotamia   and al Adil s son al Mu azzam took possession of Karak and Transjordan  In 1196  al Afdal was driven out of Damascus by Uthman  He returned when Uthman died in 1198  but was opposed by al Adil  who occupied the Citadel of Damascus  Al Adil also conquered Cairo in 1200 and banished al Afdal from Damascus in 1201  He proclaimed himself Sultan of Egypt and Syria  entrusting Damascus to al Mu azzam and al Jazira to his other son al Kamil   Meanwhile  schemes were hatched to reconquer Jerusalem through Egypt  A Fourth Crusade was planned after the failure of the Third  but it resulted in the sack of Constantinople in 1204  and most of the crusaders involved never arrived in the kingdom  Aimery  however  not knowing of the diversion to Constantinople  raided Egypt in advance of the expected invasion  Both Isabella and Aimery died in 1205 and again an underage girl  Isabella and Conrad s daughter Maria of Montferrat  became queen of Jerusalem  Isabella s half brother John of Ibelin  the Old Lord of Beirut governed as regent until 1210 when Maria married an experienced French knight  John of Brienne  Maria died in childbirth in 1212  and John of Brienne continued to rule as regent for their daughter Isabella II   3 9  Fifth Crusade and Frederick II  The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 called for a new  better organized crusade against Egypt  In late 1217 Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI  Duke of Austria arrived in Acre and  along with John of Brienne  raided territory further inland  including Mount Tabor  but without success  After the departure of the Hungarians  the remaining crusaders set about refortifying Caesarea and the Templar fortress of Château Pèlerin throughout the winter of 1217 and spring of 1218   In the spring of 1218 the Fifth Crusade began in earnest when German crusader fleets landed at Acre  Along with King John  who was elected leader of the crusade  the fleets sailed to Egypt and besieged Damietta at the mouth of the Nile in May  The siege progressed slowly  and the Egyptian sultan al Adil died in August 1218  supposedly of shock after the crusaders managed to capture one of Damietta s towers  He was succeeded by his son al Kamil  In the autumn of 1218 reinforcements arrived from Europe  including the papal legate Pelagius of Albano  In the winter the crusaders were affected by floods and disease  and the siege dragged on throughout 1219  when Francis of Assisi arrived to attempt to negotiate a truce  Neither side could agree to terms  despite the Ayyubid offer of a thirty year truce and the restoration of Jerusalem and most of the rest of the former kingdom  The crusaders finally managed to starve out the city and captured it in November  Al Kamil retreated to the nearby fortress of al Mansurah  but the crusaders remained in Damietta throughout 1219 and 1220  awaiting the arrival of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II  while King John returned to Acre briefly to defend against al Mu azzam  who was raiding the kingdom from Damascus in John s absence  Still expecting the emperor s imminent arrival  in July 1221  the crusaders set off towards Cairo  but they were stopped by the rising Nile  which al Kamil allowed to flood by breaking the dams along its course  The sultan easily defeated the trapped crusader army and regained Damietta  Emperor Frederick had  in fact  never left Europe at all   After the failure of the crusade  John travelled throughout Europe seeking assistance  but found support only from Frederick  who then married John and Maria s daughter Isabella II in 1225  The next year  Isabella died giving birth to their son Conrad IV  who succeeded his mother to the throne although he never appeared in the east  Frederick had reneged on his promise to lead the Fifth Crusade  but was now eager to cement his claim to the throne through Conrad  There were also plans to join with al Kamil in attacking al Mu azzam in Damascus  an alliance which had been discussed with Egyptian envoys in Italy  But after continually delaying his departure for the Holy Land  including suffering an outbreak of disease in his fleet  he was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX in 1227  The crusaders  led not by Frederick but by his representatives Richard Filangieri  Henry IV  Duke of Limburg  and Hermann of Salza  Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights  arrived in the east late in 1227  and while waiting for the emperor they set about refortifying Sidon  where they built the sea castle  and Montfort  which later became the headquarters of the Teutonic Knights  The Ayyubids of Damascus did not dare attack  as al Mu azzam had suddenly died not long before  Frederick finally arrived on the Sixth Crusade in September 1228  and claimed the regency of the kingdom in the name of his infant son   Frederick immediately came into conflict with the native nobles of Outremer  some of whom resented his attempts to impose Imperial authority over both Cyprus and Jerusalem  The Cypriot nobles were already quarrelling amongst themselves about the regency for Henry I of Cyprus  who was still a child  The High Court of Cyprus had elected John of Ibelin as regent  but Henry s mother Alice of Champagne wished to appoint one of her supporters  Alice and her party  members or supporters of the Lusignan dynasty  sided with Frederick  whose father had crowned Aimery of Lusignan king in 1197  At Limassol  Frederick demanded that John give up not only the regency of Cyprus  but also John s own lordship of Beirut on the mainland  John argued that Frederick had no legal authority to make such demands and refused to give up either title  Frederick then imprisoned John s sons as hostages to guarantee John s support for his crusade   John did accompany Frederick to the mainland  but Frederick was not well received there  one of his few supporters was Balian  Lord of Sidon  who had welcomed the crusaders the year before and now acted as an ambassador to the Ayyubids  The death of al Mu azzam negated the proposed alliance with al Kamil  who along with his brother al Ashraf had taken possession of Damascus  as well as Jerusalem  from their nephew  al Mu azzam s son an Nasir Dawud  However  al Kamil presumably did not know of the small size of Frederick s army  nor the divisions within it caused by his excommunication  and wished to avoid defending his territories against another crusade  Frederick s presence alone was sufficient to regain Jerusalem  Bethlehem  Nazareth  and a number of surrounding castles without a fight  these were recovered in February 1229  in return for a ten year truce with the Ayyubids and freedom of worship for Jerusalem s Muslim inhabitants  The terms of the treaty were unacceptable to the Patriarch of Jerusalem Gerald of Lausanne  who placed the city under interdict  In March  Frederick crowned himself in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre  but because of his excommunication and the interdict Jerusalem was never truly reincorporated into the kingdom  which continued to be ruled from Acre   Meanwhile  in Italy  the Pope had used Frederick s excommunication as an excuse to invade his Italian territories  the papal armies were led by Frederick s former father in law John of Brienne  Frederick was forced to return home in 1229  leaving the Holy Land  not in triumph  but showered with offal  by the citizens of Acre   3 10  War of the Lombards and the Barons  Crusade  Nevertheless  Frederick sent an Imperial army in 1231  under Richard Filangieri  who occupied Beirut and Tyre  but was unable to gain control of Acre  John s supporters formed a commune in Acre  of which John himself was elected mayor in 1232  With the help of the Genoese merchants  the commune recaptured Beirut  John also attacked Tyre  but was defeated by Filangieri at the Battle of Casal Imbert in May 1232   On Cyprus  King Henry I came of age in 1232 and John s regency was no longer necessary  Both John and Filangieri raced back to Cyprus to assert their authority  and the imperial forces were defeated at the Battle of Agridi on June 15  Henry became undisputed king of Cyprus  but continued to support the Ibelins over the Lusignans and the imperial party  On the mainland  Filangieri had the support of Bohemund IV of Antioch  the Teutonic Knights  the Knights Hospitaller  and the Pisan merchants  John was supported by his nobles on Cyprus  and by his continental holdings in Beirut  Caesarea  and Arsuf  as well as by the Knights Templar and the Genoese  Neither side could make any headway  and in 1234 Gregory IX excommunicated John and his supporters  This was partly revoked in 1235  but still no peace could be made  John died in 1236 and the war was taken up by his son Balian of Beirut and his nephew Philip of Montfort   Meanwhile  the treaty with the Ayyubids was set to expire in 1239  Plans for a new crusade to be led by Frederick came to nothing  and Frederick himself was excommunicated by Gregory IX again in 1239  However  other European nobles took up the cause  including Theobald IV  Count of Champagne and King of Navarre  Peter of Dreux  and Amaury VI of Montfort  who arrived in Acre in September 1239  Theobald was elected leader of the crusade at a council in Acre  attended by the most of the important nobles of the kingdom  including Walter of Brienne  John of Arsuf  and Balian of Sidon  The arrival of the crusade was a brief respite from the Lombard War  Filangieri remained in Tyre and did not participate  The council decided to refortify Ascalon in the south and attack Damascus in the north   The crusaders may have been aware of the new divisions among the Ayyubids  al Kamil had occupied Damascus in 1238 but had died soon afterwards  and his territory was inherited by his family  His sons al Adil abu Bakr and as Salih Ayyub inherited Egypt and Damascus  Ayyub marched on Cairo in an attempt to drive out al Adil  but during his absence al Kamil s brother as Salih Isma il took over Damascus  and Ayyub was taken prisoner by an Nasir Dawud  The crusaders  meanwhile  marched to Ascalon  Along the way  Walter of Brienne captured livestock intended to resupply Damascus  as the Ayyubids had probably learned of the crusaders  plans to attack it  The victory was short lived  however  as the crusaders were then defeated by the Egyptian army at Gaza in November of 1239  Henry II  Count of Bar was killed and Amaury of Montfort captured  The crusaders returned to Acre  possibly because the native barons of the kingdom were suspicious of Filangieri in Tyre  Dawud took advantage of the Ayyubid victory to recapture Jerusalem in December  the ten year truce having expired   Although Ayyub was Dawud s prisoner  the two now allied against al Adil in Egypt  which Ayyub seized in 1240  In Damascus  Isma il recognized the threat of Dawud and Ayyub against his own possessions  and turned to the crusaders for assistance  Theobald concluded a treaty with Isma il  in return for territorial concessions that restored Jerusalem to Christian control  as well as much of the rest of the former kingdom  even more territory than Frederick had recovered in 1229  Theobald  however  was frustrated by the Lombard War  and returned home in September 1240  Almost immediately after Theobald s departure  Richard of Cornwall arrived  He completed the rebuilding of Ascalon  and also made peace with Ayyub in Egypt  Ayyub confirmed Isma il s concessions in 1241  and prisoners taken at Gaza were exchanged by both sides  Richard returned to Europe in 1241   Although the kingdom had essentially been restored  the Lombard War continued to occupy the kingdom s nobility  As the Templars and Hospitallers supported opposite sides  they also attacked each other  and the Templars broke the treaty with the Ayyubids by attacking Nablus in 1241  Conrad proclaimed that he had come of age in 1242  eliminating both Frederick s claim to the regency and the need for an imperial guardian to govern in his place  although he had not yet turned 15  the age of majority according to the customs of Jerusalem  Through Conrad  Frederick tried to send an imperial regent  but the anti imperial faction in Acre argued that Jerusalem s laws allowed them to appoint their own regent  In June the Haute Cour granted the regency to Alice of Champagne  who  as the daughter of Isabella I  was Conrad s great aunt and his closest relative living in the kingdom  Alice ordered Filangieri to be arrested  and along with the Ibelins and Venetians  besieged Tyre  which fell in July 1243  The Lombard War was over  but the king was still absent  as Conrad never came to the east  Alice was prevented from exercising any real power as regent by Philip of Montfort  who took control of Tyre  and Balian of Beirut  who continued to hold Acre   3 11  Crusade of Louis IX  The Ayyubids were still divided between Ayyub in Egypt  Isma il in Damascus  and Dawud in Kerak  Isma il  Dawud  and al Mansur Ibrahim of Homs went to war with Ayyub  who hired the Khwarazmians to fight for him  The Khwarazmians were nomadic Turks from central Asia  who had recently been displaced by the Mongols further to the east and were now residing in Mesopotamia  With Ayyub s support they sacked Jerusalem in the summer of 1244  leaving it in ruins and useless to both Christians and Muslims  In October  the Khwarazmians  along with the Egyptian army under the command of Baibars  were met by the Frankish army  led by Philip of Montfort  Walter of Brienne  and the masters of the Templars  Hospitallers  and Teutonic Knights  along with al Mansur and Dawud  On October 17 the Egyptian Khwarazmian army destroyed the Frankish Syrian coalition  and Walter of Brienne was taken captive and later executed  By 1247  Ayyub had reoccupied most of the territory that had been conceded in 1239  and had also gained control of Damascus   A new crusade was discussed at the Council of Lyon in 1245 by Pope Innocent IV  The council deposed Frederick II  so no help could be expected from the empire  but King Louis IX of France had already vowed to go on crusade  Louis arrived in Cyprus in 1248  where he gathered an army of his own men  including his brothers Robert of Artois  Charles of Anjou  and Alphonse of Poitiers  and those of Cyprus and Jerusalem  led by the Ibelin family John of Jaffa  Guy of Ibelin  and Balian of Beirut  Once again the target was Egypt  Damietta was captured without resistance when the crusaders landed in June 1249  but the crusade halted there until November  by which time the Egyptian sultan Ayyub had died and had been succeeded by his son Turanshah  In February  the crusaders were defeated at the Battle of al Mansurah  where Robert of Artois was killed  The crusaders were unable to cross the Nile  and  suffering from disease and lack of supplies  retreated towards Damietta in April  They were defeated along the way at the Battle of Fariskur  with Louis being taken captive by Turanshah  During Louis  captivity  Turanshah was overthrown by his Mamluk soldiers  led by the general Aybak  who then released Louis in May in return for Damietta and a large ransom  For the next four years Louis resided in Acre  and helped refortify that city along with Caesarea  Jaffa  and Sidon  He also made truces with the Ayyubids in Syria  and sent embassies to negotiate with the Mongols  who were beginning to threaten the Muslim world  before returning home in 1254  He left behind a large garrison of French soldiers in Acre  under the command of Geoffrey of Sergines   In the midst of these events  Alice of Champagne had died in 1246 and had been replaced as regent by her son King Henry I of Cyprus  for whom John of Jaffa served as bailli in Acre  During Louis IX s stay in Acre  Henry I died in 1253  and was succeeded in Cyprus by his infant son Hugh II  Hugh was technically regent of Jerusalem as well  both for Conrad and for Conrad s son Conradin after Conrad died in 1254  Both Cyprus and Jerusalem were governed by Hugh s mother Plaisance of Antioch  but John remained bailli for Hugh in Acre  John made peace with Damascus and attempted to regain Ascalon  the Egyptians  now ruled by the Mamluk sultanate  besieged Jaffa in 1256 in response  John defeated them  and afterwards gave up the bailliage to his cousin John of Arsuf   3 12  The War of Saint Sabas  In 1256 the commercial rivalry between the Venetian and Genoese merchant colonies broke out into open warfare  In Acre  the two colonies disputed possession of the monastery of Saint Sabas  The Genoese  assisted by the Pisan merchants  attacked the Venetian quarter and burned their ships  but the Venetians drove them out  The Venetians were then expelled from Tyre by Philip of Monfort  John of Arsuf  John of Jaffa  John II of Beirut  the Templars  and the Teutonic Knights supported the Venetians  who also convinced the Pisans to join them  while the Hospitallers supported the Genoese  In 1257 the Venetians conquered the monastery and destroyed its fortifications  although they were unable to expel the Genoese completely  They blockaded the Genoese quarter  but the Genoese were supplied by the Hospitallers  whose complex was nearby  and by Philip of Montfort who sent food from Tyre  In August 1257  John of Arsuf tried to end the war by granting commercial rights in Acre to Ancona  an Italian ally of Genoa  but aside from Philip of Montfort and the Hospitallers  the rest of the nobles continued to support Venice  In June of 1258  Philip and the Hospitallers marched on Acre while a Genoese fleet attacked the city by sea  The naval battle was won by Venice  and the Genoese were forced to abandon their quarter and flee to Tyre with Philip  The war also spread to Tripoli and Antioch  where the Embriaco family  descended from Genoese crusaders  were pitted against Bohemond VI of Antioch  who supported the Venetians  In 1261 the Patriarch  Jacques Pantaleon  organised a council to re establish order in the kingdom  though the Genoese did not return to Acre   3 13  The Mongols  It was during this period that the Mongols arrived in the Near East  Their presence further east had already displaced the Khwarazmians  and embassies had been sent by various popes as well as Louis IX to ally or negotiate with them  but they were uninterested in alliances  They sacked Baghdad in 1258  and Aleppo and Damascus in 1260  destroying both the Abbasid caliphate and the last vestiges of the Ayyubid dynasty  Hethum I of Armenia and Bohemond VI of Antioch had already submitted to the Mongols as vassals  Some of the Mongols were Nestorian Christians  including Kitbuqa  one of the generals at the sieges of Baghdad and Damascus  but despite this  the nobles of Acre refused to submit  As the kingdom was by now a relatively unimportant state  the Mongols paid little attention to it  but there were a few skirmishes in 1260  the forces of Julian of Sidon killed the nephew of Kitbuqa  who responded by sacking Sidon  and John II of Beirut was also captured by the Mongols during another raid  The apparently inevitable Mongol conquest was stalled when Hulagu  the Mongol commander in Syria  returned home after the death of his brother Möngke Khan  leaving Kitbuqa with a small garrison  The Mamluks of Egypt then sought  and were granted  permission to advance through Frankish territory  and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260  Kitbuqa was killed and all of Syria fell under Mamluk control  On the way back to Egypt  the Mamluk sultan Qutuz was assassinated by the general Baibars  who was far less favourable than his predecessor to alliances with the Franks   3 14  Fall of Acre  John of Arsuf had died in 1258 and was replaced as bailli by Geoffrey of Sergines  Louis IX s lieutenant in Acre  Plaisance died in 1261  but as her son Hugh II was still underage  Cyprus passed to his cousin Hugh of Antioch Lusignan  whose mother Isabella of Cyprus  Alice of Champagne and Hugh I of Cyprus  daughter and Hugh II s aunt  took over the regency in Acre  She appointed as bailli her husband Henry of Antioch  who was also Plaisance s uncle   but died in 1264  The regency in Acre was then claimed by Hugh of Antioch Lusignan and his cousin Hugh of Brienne  and Hugh II died in 1267 before he reached the age of majority  Hugh of Antioch Lusignan won the dispute and succeeded Hugh II on Cyprus as Hugh III  When Conradin was executed in Sicily in 1268  there was no other Hohenstaufen heir to succeed him  and Hugh III inherited the Kingdom of Jerusalem as well in 1269  This was disputed by another branch of the Lusignan family  Maria of Antioch  daughter of Bohemond IV of Antioch and Melisende of Lusignan  herself a daughter of Isabella I and Amalric II   claimed the throne as the oldest living relative of Isabella I  but for the moment her claim was ignored  By this time  the Mamluks under Baibars were taking advantage of the kingdom s constant disputes  and began conquering the remaining crusader cities along the coast  In 1265  Baibars took Caesarea  Haifa and Arsuf  and Safad and Toron in 1266  In 1268 he captured Jaffa and Beaufort  and then besieged and destroyed Antioch   Hugh III and Baibars made a one year truce after these conquests  Baibars knew that Louis IX was planning another crusade from Europe  and assumed that the target would once again be Egypt  But instead the crusade was diverted to Tunis  where Louis died  Baibars was free to continue his campaigns  in 1270 he had the Assassins kill Philip of Montfort  and in 1271 he captured the Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights strongholds of Krak des Chevaliers and Montfort Castle  He also besieged Tripoli  but abandoned it in May when Prince Edward of England arrived  the only part of Louis IX s crusade to arrive in the east  Edward could do nothing except arrange a ten year truce with Baibars  who nevertheless attempted to have him assassinated as well  Edward left in 1272  and despite the Second Council of Lyon s plans for another crusade in 1274  no further large scale expedition ever arrived  Hugh III s authority on the mainland began to break down  he was an unpopular king  and Beirut  the only territory left outside of Acre and Tyre  started to act independently  Its heiress  Isabella of Ibelin  widow of Hugh II   actually placed it under Baibars  protection  Finding the mainland ungovernable  Hugh III left for Cyprus  leaving Balian of Arsuf as bailli  Then in 1277  Maria of Antioch sold her claim to the kingdom to Charles of Anjou  who sent Roger of San Severino to represent him  The Venetians and Templars supported the claim  and Balian was powerless to oppose him  Baibars died in 1277 and was succeeded by Qalawun  In 1281 the ten year truce expired and was renewed by Roger  Roger returned to Europe after the Sicilian Vespers in 1282  and was replaced by Odo Poilechien  Hugh III attempted to re assert his authority on the mainland by landing at Beirut in 1283  but this was ineffective and he died in Tyre in 1284  He was succeeded briefly by his son John II  who died soon after in 1285  and was succeeded by his brother  Hugh III s other son Henry II  That year Qalawun captured the Hospitaller fortress of Marqab  Charles of Anjou also died in 1285  and the military orders and the commune of Acre accepted Henry II as king  Odo Poilechen refused to recognize him  but was allowed to hand Acre over to the Templars rather than Henry directly  and the Templars then handed it to the king  War broke out between the Venetians and Genoese again in 1287  and Tripoli fell to Qalawun in 1289  Although it was only a matter of time before Acre also fell  the end of the crusader kingdom was actually instigated in 1290 by newly arrived crusaders  who rioted in Acre and attacked the city s Muslim merchants  Qalawun died before he could retaliate  but his son al Ashraf Khalil arrived to besiege Acre in April 1291  Acre was defended by Henry II s brother Amalric of Tyre  the Hospitallers  Templars  and Teutonic Knights  the Venetians and Pisans  the French garrison led by Jean I de Grailly  and the English garrison led by Otton de Grandson  but they were vastly outnumbered  Henry II himself arrived in May during the siege  but the city fell on May 18  Henry  Amalric  Otton  and Jean escaped  as did a young Templar named Roger de Flor  but most of the other defenders did not  including the master of the Templars Guillaume de Beaujeu  Tyre fell without a fight the next day  Sidon fell in June  and Beirut in July   The crusaders moved their headquarters north to cities such as Tortosa  but lost that too  and were forced to relocate their headquarters offshore to Cyprus  Some naval raids and attempts to retake territory were made over the next ten years  but with the loss of the island of Arwad in 1302 1303  the Kingdom of Jerusalem ceased to exist on the mainland  The kings of Cyprus for many decades hatched plans to regain the Holy Land  but without success  For the next seven centuries  up to today  a veritable multitude of European monarchs have used the title of King of Jerusalem   4  Life in the early kingdom  The Latin population of the kingdom was always small  although a steady stream of settlers and new crusaders continually arrived  most of the original crusaders who fought in the First Crusade simply went home  According to William of Tyre   barely three hundred knights and two thousand foot soldiers could be found  in the kingdom in 1100 during Godfrey s siege of Arsuf  From the very beginning  the Latins were little more than a colonial frontier exercising rule over the native Muslim  Greek and Syrian population  who were more numerous  But Jerusalem came to be known as Outremer  the French word for  overseas   and as new generations grew up in the kingdom  they began to think of themselves as natives  rather than immigrants  Although they never gave up their core identity as Western Europeans or Franks  their clothing  diet  and commercialism integrated much Oriental  particularly Byzantine  influence  As the chronicler Fulcher of Chartres wrote around 1124    For we who were Occidentals now have been made Orientals  He who was a Roman or Frank has in this land been made into a Galilean or a Palestinian  He who was of Rheims or Chartres has now become a citizen of Tyre or Antioch  We have already forgotten the places of our birth  already these are unknown to many of us or not mentioned any more   The crusaders and their descendants often learned to speak Greek  Arabic  and other eastern languages  and intermarried with the native Christians  whether Greek  Syrian  or Armenian  and sometimes with converted Muslims  Nonetheless  the Frankish principalities remained a distinctive Occidental colony in the heart of Islam   Fulcher  a participant in the First Crusade and chaplain of Baldwin I  continued his chronicle up to 1127  Fulcher s chronicle was very popular and was used as a source by other historians in the west  such as Orderic Vitalis and William of Malmesbury  Almost as soon as Jerusalem had been captured  and continuing throughout the 12th century  many pilgrims arrived and left accounts of the new kingdom  among them are the English Saewulf  the Russian Abbot Daniel  the Frank Fretellus  the Byzantine Johannes Phocas  and the Germans John of Würzburg and Theoderich  Aside from these  thereafter there is no eyewitness to events in Jerusalem until William of Tyre  archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of Jerusalem  who began writing around 1167 and died around 1184  although he includes much information about the First Crusade and the intervening years from the death of Fulcher to his own time  drawn mainly from the writings of Albert of Aix and Fulcher himself  From the Muslim perspective  a chief source of information is Usamah ibn Munqidh  a soldier and frequent ambassador from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt  whose memoirs  Kitab al i tibar  include lively accounts of crusader society in the east  Further information can be gathered from travellers such as Benjamin of Tudela and Ibn Jubayr   4 1  Crusader society and demographics  The Kingdom at first was virtually bereft of a loyal subject population and had few knights to implement the laws and orders of the realm  With the arrival of Italian trading firms  the creation of the military orders  and immigration by European knights  artisans  and farmers  the affairs of the Kingdom improved and a feudal society developed  similar to but distinct from the society the crusaders knew in Europe  The nature of this society has long been a subject of debate among crusade historians   In the 19th and early 20th centuries  French scholars  such as E  G  Rey  Gaston Dodu  and René Grousset believed that the crusaders and the native Muslims and Christians lived in a totally integrated society  Ronnie Ellenblum claims this view was influenced by French imperialism and colonialism  if medieval French crusaders could integrate themselves into local society  then certainly modern French colonies in the Levant could thrive  In the mid 20th century  scholars such as Joshua Prawer  R  C  Smail  Meron Benvenisti  and Claude Cahen argued instead that the crusaders lived totally segregated from the native inhabitants  who were thoroughly Arabicized and or Islamicized and were a constant threat to the foreign crusaders  Prawer argued further that the kingdom was an early attempt at colonization  in which the crusaders were a small ruling class  who were dependent on the native population for survival but made no attempt to integrate with them  For this reason  the rural European society to which the crusaders were accustomed was replaced by a more secure urban society in the pre existing cities of the Levant   According to Ellenblum s interpretation the inhabitants of the Kingdom  Latin Christians living alongside native Greek and Syrian Christians  Shia and Sunni Arabs  Sufis  Bedouin  Turks  Druze  Jews  and Samaritans  all had major differences between each other as well as with the crusaders  Relations between eastern Christians and the Latin crusaders were  complex and ambiguous   not simply friendly or hostile  The Turks were the common enemy for everyone  as they were only very recent arrivals in the Levant  and although they had imposed their rule prior to the arrival of the crusaders  it is unlikely that they were thoroughly Islamicized as Prawer and others believed  The eastern Christians  at least  probably felt closer ties to their fellow Christian crusaders than to either Turkic overlords or Muslim Arabs   Although the crusaders came upon an ancient urban society  Ellenblum argues that they neither completely abandoned their rural European lifestyle  nor was European society completely rural to begin with  Crusader settlement in the Levant resembled the types of colonization and settlement that were already being practiced in Europe  a mixture of urban and rural civilization centred around fortresses  The crusaders were neither totally integrated with the native population  nor did they segregate themselves in the cities away from the rural natives  but rather that they settled in both urban and rural areas  specifically  they settled in areas that had traditionally been inhabited by the eastern Christians  Areas that were traditionally Muslim had very little crusader settlement  just as they already had very few native Christian inhabitants   Into this mixed society the crusaders adapted existing institutions and introduced their own familiar customs from Europe  As in Europe the nobles had their own vassals and were themselves vassals to the king  Agricultural production was regulated by the iqta  a Muslim system of land ownership and payments roughly  though far from exactly  equivalent to the feudal system of Europe  and this system was not heavily disrupted by the crusaders   As Hans Mayer says   the Muslim inhabitants of the Latin Kingdom hardly ever appear in the Latin chronicles   so information on their role in society is difficult to find  The crusaders  had a natural tendency to ignore these matters as simply without interest and certainly not worthy of record   Although Muslims  as well as Jews and Eastern Christians  had virtually no rights in the countryside  where they were essentially the property of the crusader lord who owned the land  tolerance for other faiths was in general no higher or lower than that found elsewhere in the Middle East  Greeks  Syrians  and Jews continued to live as they had before  subject to their own laws and courts  with their former Muslim overlords simply replaced by the crusaders  Muslims now joined them at the lowest level of society  The ra is  the leader of a Muslim or Syrian community  was a kind of vassal to whatever noble owned his land  but as the crusader nobles were absentee landlords the ra is and their communities had a high degree of autonomy   Arab Andalusian geographer and traveler Ibn Jubayr  who was hostile to the Franks  described the Muslims living under the Christian crusaders  Kingdom of Jerusalem in the late 12th century   In the cities  Muslims and Eastern Christians were free  although no Muslims were permitted to live in Jerusalem itself  They were second class citizens and played no part in politics or law  and owed no military service to the crown  although in some cities they may have been the majority of the population  Likewise  citizens of the Italian city states owed nothing as they lived in autonomous quarters in the port cities   There were an unknown number of Muslim slaves living in the Kingdom  There was a very large slave market in Acre which functioned throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  Although Christians  both Western and Eastern  were by law prohibited from being sold into slavery  the native Christians were often indistinguishable from the Muslim population and the Italian merchants were sometimes accused of selling them along with Muslim slaves  Slavery was less common than ransom  especially for prisoners of war  the large numbers of prisoners taken during raids and battles every year ensured that ransom money flowed freely between the Christian and Muslim states  Escape for prisoners and slaves was probably not difficult  as the inhabitants of the countryside were majority Muslim  and fugitive slaves were always a problem  The only legal means of manumission was conversion to  Catholic  Christianity  No Christian  whether Western or Eastern  was permitted by law to be sold into slavery   The nomadic Bedouin tribes were considered to be the property of the king and under his protection  They could be sold or alienated just like any other property  and later in the 12th century they were often under the protection of a lesser noble or one of the military orders   21st century positions on the question of cultural integration or cultural apartheid remains debated  Interactions between the Franks and the native Muslims and Christians  though muddled  prevailed on practical coexistence  Though likely overstated  the accounts of Usamah Ibn Munqidh of Shaizar’s travels through Antioch and Jerusalem described a level of aristocratic exchange elevated above ethnic prejudice  Contact between Muslims and Christians came on the administrative or personal level  on the basis of taxes or translation   not communal or cultural  representative of a hierarchical lord over subject relationship  Evidence of inter cultural integration remains scarce  but evidence of inter cultural cooperation and complex social interaction proves more common  Key use of the word dragoman  literally translator  with Syrian administrators and Arabic headsmen represented the direct need for negotiation of interests on both sides  Comments on households with Arabic speaking Christians and a few Arabized Jews and Muslims represent a less dichotomous relationship than the mid 20th century historians depicted  Rather  the commonality of Frankish Christians having non Frankish priests  doctors  and other roles within households and inter cultural communities presents the lack of standardized discrimination  Jersulamite William of Tyre complained about a trend to hire Jewish or Muslim medical practitioners over their Latin and Frankish counterparts  Evidence even indicates alterations to Frankish cultural and social customs regarding hygiene  notorious amongst Arabs for their lack of washing and knowledge of bathhouse culture   going so far as to ensure water supplies for domestic use in addition to irrigation   4 2  Population  It is impossible to give an accurate estimate of the population of the kingdom  Josiah Russell calculates that all of Syria had about 2 3 million people at the time of the crusades  with perhaps eleven thousand villages  most of these  of course  were outside of crusader rule even at the greatest extent of all four crusader states  It has been estimated by scholars such as Joshua Prawer and Meron Benvenisti that there were at most 120 000 Franks and 100 000 Muslims living in the cities  with another 250 000 Muslim and Eastern Christian peasants in the countryside  The crusaders accounted for 15–25% of the total population  Benjamin Z  Kedar estimates that there were between three hundred thousand and three hundred and sixty thousand non Franks in the Kingdom  two hundred and fifty thousand of whom were villagers in the countryside  and  one may assume that Muslims were in the majority in some  possibly most parts of the kingdom of Jerusalem…  As Ronnie Ellenblum points out  there simply is not enough existing evidence to accurately count the population and any estimate is inherently unreliable  Contemporary chronicler William of Tyre recorded the census of 1183  which was intended to determine the number of men available to defend against an invasion  and to determine the amount of tax money that could be obtained from the inhabitants  Muslim or Christian  If the population was actually counted  William did not record the number  In the 13th century  John of Ibelin drew up a list of fiefs and the number of knights owed by each  but this gives no indication of the non noble  non Latin population   The Mamluks  led by Baibars  eventually made good their pledge to cleanse the entire Middle East of the Franks  With the fall of Antioch  1268   Tripoli  1289   and Acre  1291   those Christians unable to leave the cities were massacred or enslaved and the last traces of Christian rule in the Levant disappeared   4 3  Economy  The urban composition of the area  combined with the presence of the Italian merchants  led to the development of an economy that was much more commercial than it was agricultural  Palestine had always been a crossroads for trade  now  this trade extended to Europe as well  European goods  such as the woolen textiles of northern Europe  made their way to the Middle East and Asia  while Asian goods were transported back to Europe  Jerusalem was especially involved in the silk  cotton and spice trade  other items that first appeared in Europe through trade with crusader Jerusalem included oranges and sugar  the latter of which chronicler William of Tyre called  very necessary for the use and health of mankind   In the countryside  wheat  barley  legumes  olives  grapes  and dates were grown  The Italian city states made enormous profits from this trade  thanks to commercial treaties like the Pactum Warmundi  and it influenced their Renaissance in later centuries   Jerusalem collected money through tribute payments  first from the coastal cities which had not yet been captured  and later from other neighbouring states such as Damascus and Egypt  which the crusaders could not conquer directly  After Baldwin I extended his rule over Oultrejordain  Jerusalem gained revenue from the taxation of Muslim caravans passing from Syria to Egypt or Arabia  The money economy of Jerusalem meant that their manpower problem could be partially solved by paying for mercenaries  an uncommon occurrence in medieval Europe  Mercenaries could be fellow European crusaders  or  perhaps more often  Muslim soldiers  including the famous Turcopoles   4 4  Education  Jerusalem was the center of education in the kingdom  There was a school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre  where the basic skills of reading and writing Latin were taught  the relative wealth of the merchant class meant that their children could be educated there along with the children of nobles – it is likely that William of Tyre was a classmate of future king Baldwin III  Higher education had to be undertaken at one of the universities in Europe  the development of a university was impossible in the culture of crusader Jerusalem  where warfare was far more important than philosophy or theology  Nonetheless  the nobility and general Frankish population were noted for the high literacy  lawyers and clerks were in abundance  and the study of law  history  and other academic subjects was a beloved pastime of the royal family and the nobility  Jerusalem had an extensive library not only of ancient and medieval Latin works but of Arabic literature  much of which was apparently captured from Usamah ibn Munqidh and his entourage after a shipwreck in 1154  The Holy Sepulchre contained the kingdom s scriptorium and the city had a chancery where royal charters and other documents were produced  Aside from Latin  the standard written language of medieval Europe  the populace of crusader Jerusalem communicated in vernacular forms of French and Italian  Greek  Armenian  and even Arabic were used by Frankish settlers   4 5  Art and architecture  In Jerusalem itself the greatest architectural endeavour was the expansion of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in western Gothic style  This expansion consolidated all the separate shrines on the site into one building  and was completed by 1149  Outside of Jerusalem  castles and fortresses were the major focus of construction  Kerak and Montreal in Oultrejordain and Ibelin near Jaffa are among the numerous examples of crusader castles   Crusader art was a mix of Western  Byzantine  and Islamic styles  The major cities featured baths  interior plumbing  and other advanced hygienic tools which were lacking in most other cities and towns throughout the world  The foremost example of crusader art are perhaps the Melisende Psalter  an illuminated manuscript commissioned between 1135 and 1143 and now located in the British Library  and the sculpted Nazareth Capitals  Paintings and mosaics were popular forms of art in the kingdom  but many of these were destroyed by the Mamluks in the 13th century  only the most durable fortresses survived the reconquest   4 6  Government and legal system  Immediately after the First Crusade  land was distributed to loyal vassals of Godfrey  forming numerous feudal lordships within the kingdom  This was continued by Godfrey s successors  The number and importance of the lordships varied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  and many cities were part of the royal domain  The king was assisted by a number of officers of state  The king and the royal court were normally located in Jerusalem  but due to the prohibition on Muslim inhabitants  the capital was small and underpopulated  The king just as often held court at Acre  Nablus  Tyre  or wherever else he happened to be  In Jerusalem  the royal family lived firstly on the Temple Mount  before the foundation of the Knights Templar  and later in the palace complex surrounding the Tower of David  there was another palace complex in Acre   Because the nobles tended to live in Jerusalem rather than on estates in the countryside  they had a larger influence on the king than they would have had in Europe  The nobles  along with the bishops  formed the haute cour  high court   which was responsible for confirming the election of a new king  or a regent if necessary   collecting taxes  minting coins  allotting money to the king  and raising armies  The haute cour was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom  hearing criminal cases such as murder  rape  and treason  and simpler feudal disputes such as recovery of slaves  sales and purchases of fiefs  and default of service  Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile  or in extreme cases death  The first laws of the kingdom were  according to tradition  established during Godfrey of Bouillon s short reign  but were more probably established by Baldwin II at the Council of Nablus in 1120  Benjamin Z  Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but had fallen out of use by the thirteenth  Marwan Nader questions this and suggests that the canons may not have applied to the whole kingdom at all times  The most extensive collection of laws  together known as Assizes of Jerusalem  were written in the mid 13th century  although many of them are purported to be twelfth century in origin   There were other  lesser courts for non nobles and non Latins  the Cour des Bourgeois provided justice for non noble Latins  dealing with minor criminal offences such as assault and theft  and provided rules for disputes between non Latins  who had fewer legal rights  Special courts such as the Cour de la Fond  for commercial disputes in the markets  and the Cour de la Mer  an admiralty court  existed in the coastal cities  The extent to which native Islamic and Eastern Christian courts continued to function is unknown  but the ra is probably exercised some legal authority on a local level  The Cour des Syriens judged non criminal matters among the native Christians  the  Syrians    For criminal matters non Latins were to be tried in the Cour des Bourgeois  or even the Haute Cour if the crime was sufficiently severe    The Italian communes were granted almost complete autonomy from the very early days of the Kingdom  thanks to their military and naval support in the years following the First Crusade  This autonomy included the right to administer their own justice  although the kinds of cases that fell under their jurisdiction varied at different times   The king was recognised as head of the Haute Cour  although he was legally only primus inter pares   5  Arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  The coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  which has gone through several different varieties of a cross Or  gold  on an argent  silver  field  is a famous violation of or exception to the rule of tincture in heraldry  which prohibits the placement of metal on metal   It is one of the earliest known coats of arms  The main cross is a cross potent  called a Jerusalem cross for its use here   whereas the smaller crosses are Greek crosses  one of the many Byzantine influences on the kingdom   6  Later claimants to the Throne of Jerusalem  After the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  various European dynasties and royal houses claimed its throne and formally registered it among their titles  though none of them made any attempt to actually regain rule over its territory  At present  claimants include King Felipe VI of Spain as well as several claimants to European thrones in countries where the monarchy had been abolished   7  See also  Assizes of Jerusalem  Crusade  Haute Cour of Jerusalem  History of Palestine  Jerusalem during the Crusader period  Kings of Jerusalem family tree  List of Kings of Jerusalem
