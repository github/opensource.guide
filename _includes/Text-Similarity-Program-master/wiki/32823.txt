Very large scale integration  VLSI  is the process of creating an integrated circuit  IC  by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip  VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed  The microprocessor is a VLSI device  Before the introduction of VLSI technology  most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform  An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU  ROM  RAM and other glue logic  VLSI lets IC makers add all of these into one chip   1  History  During the mid 1920s  several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid state diodes and convert them into triodes  Success had to wait until after WWII  during which the attempt to improve silicon and germanium crystals for use as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and in the understanding of quantum mechanical states of carriers in semiconductors  Then scientists who had been diverted to radar development returned to solid state device development  With the invention of transistors at Bell Labs in 1947  the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid state devices   With the small and effective transistor at their hands  electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits  As the complexity of circuits grew  problems arose   One problem was the size of the circuit  A complex circuit  like a computer  was dependent on speed  If the components of the computer were too large or the wires interconnecting them too long  the electric signals couldn t travel fast enough through the circuit  thus making the computer too slow to be effective   Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments found a solution to this problem in 1958  Kilby s idea was to make all the components and the chip out of the same block  monolith  of semiconductor material  Kilby presented his idea to his superiors  and was allowed to build a test version of his circuit  In September 1958  he had his first integrated circuit ready  Although the first integrated circuit was crude and had some problems  the idea was groundbreaking  By making all the parts out of the same block of material and adding the metal needed to connect them as a layer on top of it  there was no need for discrete components  No more wires and components had to be assembled manually  The circuits could be made smaller  and the manufacturing process could be automated  From here  the idea of integrating all components on a single silicon wafer came into existence  which led to development in small scale integration  SSI  in the early 1960s  medium scale integration  MSI  in the late 1960s  and then large scale integration  LSI  as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s  with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip  later hundreds of thousands  then millions  and now billions  109     2  Top Secret US Navy Project  In order to produce the guidance computers for its Polaris missiles  the US Navy is rumored to have financed the miniaturization of electronic circuits  This work is still classified  but the Polaris A1 was launched in 1960 and the long range Polaris A2 went into service in 1962  We know about the computer D 17B developed for the guidance system of the Minuteman I  but nothing has come out about the guidance system of the Polaris A1  A2 or A3  There are stories of job interviewees at Texas Instruments being shown an IBM 7094 equivalent the size of a desktop ornament in the 1960s  Also unknown is whether any of this knowledge found its way into the commercial world  We do know that the Soviets also developed a submarine launched ballistic missile R 29 Vysota   3  Developments  The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each  Subsequent advances added more transistors  and as a consequence  more individual functions or systems were integrated over time  The first integrated circuits held only a few devices  perhaps as many as ten diodes  transistors  resistors and capacitors  making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device  Now known retrospectively as small scale integration  SSI   improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates  known as medium scale integration  MSI   Further improvements led to large scale integration  LSI   i e  systems with at least a thousand logic gates  Current technology has moved far past this mark and today s microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors   At one time  there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large scale integration above VLSI  Terms like ultra large scale integration  ULSI  were used  But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot  Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use   As of early 2008  billion transistor processors are commercially available  This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then current generation of 65 nm processes  Current designs  unlike the earliest devices  use extensive design automation and automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors  enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality  Certain high performance logic blocks like the SRAM  static random access memory  cell  are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency  VLSI technology may be moving toward further radical miniaturization with introduction of NEMS technology   4  Structured design  Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area  This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using wiring by abutment  An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells  In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting   Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s  but lost its popularity later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing  which is tolerated because of the progress of Moore s Law  When introducing the hardware description language KARL in the mid  1970s  Reiner Hartenstein coined the term  structured VLSI design   originally as  structured LSI design    echoing Edsger Dijkstra s structured programming approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic spaghetti structured programs   5  Challenges  Process variation – As photolithography techniques tend closer to the fundamental laws of optics  achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires is becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation  Designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication process corners before a chip is certified ready for production   Stricter design rules – Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling  design rules for layout have become increasingly stringent  Designers must keep ever more of these rules in mind while laying out custom circuits  The overhead for custom design is now reaching a tipping point  with many design houses opting to switch to electronic design automation  EDA  tools to automate their design process   Timing design closure – As clock frequencies tend to scale up  designers are finding it more difficult to distribute and maintain low clock skew between these high frequency clocks across the entire chip  This has led to a rising interest in multicore and multiprocessor architectures  since an overall speedup can be obtained by lowering the clock frequency and distributing processing   First pass success – As die sizes shrink  due to scaling   and wafer sizes go up  due to lower manufacturing costs   the number of dies per wafer increases  and the complexity of making suitable photomasks goes up rapidly  A mask set for a modern technology can cost several million dollars  This non recurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several  spin cycles  to find errors in silicon  and encourages first pass silicon success  Several design philosophies have been developed to aid this new design flow  including design for manufacturing  DFM   design for test  DFT   and Design for X   6  See also  Application specific integrated circuit  Caltech Cosmic Cube  Design rules checking  Electronic design automation
