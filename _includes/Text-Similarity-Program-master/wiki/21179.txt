The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain  Scandinavia  Germany  the Netherlands  Belgium  and France  An epeiric  or  shelf   sea on the European continental shelf  it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north  It is more than long and wide  with an area of around    The North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major fishery  The sea is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries and more recently has developed into a rich source of energy resources including fossil fuels  wind  and early efforts in wave power   Historically  the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs  particularly in Northern Europe but also globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era  The North Sea was the centre of the Vikings  rise  Subsequently  the Hanseatic League  the Netherlands  and the British each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus the access to the markets and resources of the world  As Germany s only outlet to the ocean  the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars   The coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features  In the north  deep fjords and sheer cliffs mark the Norwegian and Scottish coastlines  whereas in the south it consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide mudflats  Due to the dense population  heavy industrialization  and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it  there have been a number of environmental issues affecting the sea s ecosystems  Environmental concerns — commonly including overfishing  industrial and agricultural runoff  dredging  and dumping among others — have led to a number of efforts to prevent degradation of the sea while still making use of its economic potential   1  Geography  The North Sea is bounded by the Orkney Islands and east coast of Great Britain to the west and the northern and central European mainland to the east and south  including Norway  Denmark  Germany  the Netherlands  Belgium  and France  In the southwest  beyond the Straits of Dover  the North Sea becomes the English Channel connecting to the Atlantic Ocean  In the east  it connects to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak and Kattegat  narrow straits that separate Denmark from Norway and Sweden respectively  In the north it is bordered by the Shetland Islands  and connects with the Norwegian Sea  which lies in the very north eastern part of the Atlantic   The North Sea is more than long and wide  with an area of and a volume of   Around the edges of the North Sea are sizeable islands and archipelagos  including Shetland  Orkney  and the Frisian Islands  The North Sea receives freshwater from a number of European continental watersheds  as well as the British Isles  A large part of the European drainage basin empties into the North Sea including water from the Baltic Sea  The largest and most important rivers flowing into the North Sea are the Elbe and the Rhine – Meuse watershed  Around 185 million people live in the catchment area of the rivers discharging into the North Sea encompassing some highly industrialized areas   1 1  Major features  For the most part  the sea lies on the European continental shelf with a mean depth of   The only exception is the Norwegian trench  which extends parallel to the Norwegian shoreline from Oslo to an area north of Bergen  It is between wide and has a maximum depth of    The Dogger Bank  a vast moraine  or accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris  rises to a mere 15 to 30 metres  50–100 ft  below the surface  This feature has produced the finest fishing location of the North Sea  The Long Forties and the Broad Fourteens are large areas with roughly uniform depth in fathoms   forty fathoms and fourteen fathoms or 73 and 26 m deep respectively   These great banks and others make the North Sea particularly hazardous to navigate  which has been alleviated by the implementation of satellite navigation systems  The Devil s Hole lies east of Dundee  Scotland  The feature is a series of asymmetrical trenches between long  wide and up to deep   1 2  Extent  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the North Sea as follows   On the Southwest  A line joining the Walde Lighthouse  France  1°55 E  and Leathercoat Point  England  51°10 N   On the Northwest  From Dunnet Head  3°22 W  in Scotland to Tor Ness  58°47 N  in the Island of Hoy  thence through this island to the Kame of Hoy  58°55 N  on to Breck Ness on Mainland  58°58 N  through this island to Costa Head  3°14 W  and to Inga Ness  59 17 N  in Westray through Westray  to Bow Head  across to Mull Head  North point of Papa Westray  and on to Seal Skerry  North point of North Ronaldsay  and thence to Horse Island  South

Gloup Ness  1°04 W  and across to Spoo Ness  60°45 N  in Unst island  through Unst to Herma Ness  60°51 N   on to the SW point of the Rumblings and to Muckle Flugga    all these being included in the North Sea area  thence up the meridian of 0°53  West to the parallel of 61°00  North and eastward along this parallel to the coast of Norway  the whole of Viking Bank being thus included in the North Sea   On the East  The Western limit of the Skagerrak  A line joining Hanstholm    and the Naze  Lindesnes       1 3  Hydrology  1 3 1  Temperature and salinity  The average temperature in summer is and in the winter  The average temperatures have been trending higher since 1988  which has been attributed to climate change  Air temperatures in January range on average between and in July between   The winter months see frequent gales and storms   The salinity averages between 34 to 35 grams of salt per litre of water  The salinity has the highest variability where there is fresh water inflow  such as at the Rhine and Elbe estuaries  the Baltic Sea exit and along the coast of Norway   1 3 2  Water circulation and tides  The main pattern to the flow of water in the North Sea is an anti clockwise rotation along the edges   The North Sea is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean receiving the majority of ocean current from the northwest opening  and a lesser portion of warm current from the smaller opening at the English Channel  These tidal currents leave along the Norwegian coast  Surface and deep water currents may move in different directions  Low salinity surface coastal waters move offshore  and deeper  denser high salinity waters move in shore   The North Sea located on the continental shelf has different waves than those in deep ocean water  The wave speeds are diminished and the wave amplitudes are increased  In the North Sea there are two amphidromic systems and a third incomplete amphidromic system  In the North Sea the average tide difference in wave amplitude is between   The Kelvin tide of the Atlantic ocean is a semidiurnal wave that travels northward  Some of the energy from this wave travels through the English Channel into the North Sea  The wave still travels northward in the Atlantic Ocean  and once past the northern tip of Great Britain  the Kelvin wave turns east and south and once again enters into the North Sea   1 3 2 1  Selected tide ranges around North Sea  1 4  Coasts  The eastern and western coasts of the North Sea are jagged  formed by glaciers during the ice ages  The coastlines along the southernmost part are covered with the remains of deposited glacial sediment  The Norwegian mountains plunge into the sea creating deep fjords and archipelagos  South of Stavanger  the coast softens  the islands become fewer  The eastern Scottish coast is similar  though less severe than Norway  From north east of England  the cliffs become lower and are composed of less resistant moraine  which erodes more easily  so that the coasts have more rounded contours  In Holland  Belgium and in the east of England  East Anglia  the littoral is low and marshy  The east coast and south east of the North Sea  Wadden Sea  have coastlines that are mainly sandy and straight owing to longshore drift  particularly along Belgium and Denmark   2  Coastal management  The southern coastal areas were originally amphibious flood plains and swampy land  In areas especially vulnerable to storm tides  people settled behind elevated levees and on natural areas of high ground such as spits and Geestland  As early as 500 BC  people were constructing artificial dwelling hills higher than the prevailing flood levels  It was only around the beginning of the High Middle Ages  in 1200 AD  that inhabitants began to connect single ring dikes into a dike line along the entire coast  thereby turning amphibious regions between the land and the sea into permanent solid ground   The modern form of the dikes supplemented by overflow and lateral diversion channels  began to appear in the 17th and 18th centuries  built in the Netherlands  The North Sea Floods of 1953 and 1962 were impetus for further raising of the dikes as well as the shortening of the coast line so as to present as little surface area as possible to the punishment of the sea and the storms  Currently  27% of the Netherlands is below sea level protected by dikes  dunes  and beach flats   Coastal management today consists of several levels  The dike slope reduces the energy of the incoming sea  so that the dike itself does not receive the full impact  Dikes that lie directly on the sea are especially reinforced  The dikes have  over the years  been repeatedly raised  sometimes up to and have been made flatter to better reduce wave erosion  Where the dunes are sufficient to protect the land behind them from the sea  these dunes are planted with beach grass to protect them from erosion by wind  water  and foot traffic   2 1  Storm tides  Storm tides threaten  in particular  the coasts of the Netherlands  Belgium  Germany  and Denmark and low lying areas of eastern England particularly around The Wash and Fens  Storm surges are caused by changes in barometric pressure combined with strong wind created wave action   The first recorded storm tide flood was the Julianenflut  on 17 February 1164  In its wake the Jadebusen   a bay on the coast of Germany   began to form  A storm tide in 1228 is recorded to have killed more than 100 000 people  In 1362  the Second Marcellus Flood  also known as the Grote Manndränke  hit the entire southern coast of the North Sea  Chronicles of the time again record more than 100 000 deaths as large parts of the coast were lost permanently to the sea  including the now legendary lost city of Rungholt  In the 20th century  the North Sea flood of 1953 flooded several nations  coasts and cost more than 2 000 lives  315 citizens of Hamburg died in the North Sea flood of 1962   2 1 1  Tsunamis  Though rare  the North Sea has been the site of a number of historically documented tsunamis  The Storegga Slides were a series of underwater landslides  in which a piece of the Norwegian continental shelf slid into the Norwegian Sea  The immense landslips occurred between 8150 BCE and 6000 BCE  and caused a tsunami up to high that swept through the North Sea  having the greatest effect on Scotland and the Faeroe Islands  The Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 is among the first recorded earthquakes in the North Sea measuring between 5 6 and 5 9 on the Richter Scale  This event caused extensive damage in Calais both through its tremors and possibly triggered a tsunami  though this has never been confirmed  The theory is a vast underwater landslide in the English Channel was triggered by the earthquake  which in turn caused a tsunami  The tsunami triggered by the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake reached Holland  although the waves had lost their destructive power  The largest earthquake ever recorded in the United Kingdom was the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake  which measured 6 1 on the Richter Scale and caused a small tsunami that flooded parts of the British coast   3  Geology  Shallow epicontinental seas like the current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf  The rifting that formed the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods  from about   caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles  Since then  a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the highs of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles  This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time  Sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas  such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south west  the Paratethys Sea to the south east  or the Tethys Ocean to the south  During the Late Cretaceous  about   all of modern mainland Europe except for Scandinavia was a scattering of islands  By the Early Oligocene    the emergence of Western and Central Europe had almost completely separated the North Sea from the Tethys Ocean  which gradually shrank to become the Mediterranean as Southern Europe and South West Asia became dry land  The North Sea was cut off from the English Channel by a narrow land bridge until that was breached by at least two catastrophic floods between 450 000 and 180 000 years ago  Since the start of the Quaternary period about   the eustatic sea level has fallen during each glacial period and then risen again  Every time the ice sheet reached its greatest extent  the North Sea became almost completely dry  The present day coastline formed after the Last Glacial Maximum when the sea began to flood the European continental shelf   In 2006 a bone fragment was found while drilling for oil in the north sea  Analysis indicated that it was a Plateosaurus from 199 to 216 million years ago  This was the deepest dinosaur fossil ever found and the first find for Norway   4  Natural history  4 1  Fish and shellfish  Copepods and other zooplankton are plentiful in the North Sea  These tiny organisms are crucial elements of the food chain supporting many species of fish  Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea  Cod  haddock  whiting  saithe  plaice  sole  mackerel  herring  pouting  sprat  and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially  Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity  temperature  and water movement  some fish such as blue mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea   Crustaceans are also commonly found throughout the sea  Norway lobster  deep water prawns  and brown shrimp are all commercially fished  but other species of lobster  shrimp  oyster  mussels and clams all live in the North Sea  Recently non indigenous species have become established including the Pacific oyster and Atlantic jackknife clam   4 2  Birds  The coasts of the North Sea are home to nature reserves including the Ythan Estuary  Fowlsheugh Nature Preserve  and Farne Islands in the UK and the Wadden Sea National Parks in Denmark  Germany and the Netherlands  These locations provide breeding habitat for dozens of bird species  Tens of millions of birds make use of the North Sea for breeding  feeding  or migratory stopovers every year  Populations of Black legged Kittiwakes  Atlantic Puffins  Northern fulmars  and species of petrels  gannets  seaducks  loons  divers   cormorants  gulls  auks  and terns  and many other seabirds make these coasts popular for birdwatching   4 3  Marine mammals  The North Sea is also home to marine mammals  Common seals  and Harbour porpoises can be found along the coasts  at marine installations  and on islands  The very northern North Sea islands such as the Shetland Islands are occasionally home to a larger variety of pinnipeds including bearded  harp  hooded and ringed seals  and even walrus  North Sea cetaceans include various porpoise  dolphin and whale species   4 4  Flora  Plant species in the North Sea include species of wrack  among them bladder wrack  knotted wrack  and serrated wrack  Algae  macroalgal  and kelp  such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria  and species of maerl are found as well  Eelgrass  formerly common in the entirety of the Wadden Sea  was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease  Similarly  sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor  but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return  Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance   4 5  Biodiversity and conservation  Due to the heavy human populations and high level of industrialization along its shores  the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution  overhunting  and overfishing  Flamingos  pelicans  and Great Auk were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea  but went extinct over the 2nd millennium  Gray whale also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th century Other species have dramatically declined in population  though they are still found  Right whales  sturgeon  shad  rays  skates  salmon  and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th century  when numbers declined due to overfishing  Other factors like the introduction of non indigenous species  industrial and agricultural pollution  trawling and dredging  human induced eutrophication  construction on coastal breeding and feeding grounds  sand and gravel extraction  offshore construction  and heavy shipping traffic have also contributed to the decline   The OSPAR commission manages the OSPAR convention to counteract the harmful effects of human activity on wildlife in the North Sea  preserve endangered species  and provide environmental protection  All North Sea border states are signatories of the MARPOL 73 78 Accords  which preserve the marine environment by preventing pollution from ships  Germany  Denmark  and the Netherlands also have a trilateral agreement for the protection of the Wadden Sea  or mudflats  which run along the coasts of the three countries on the southern edge of the North Sea   5  History  5 1  Name  Through history various names have been used for the North Sea  One of the earliest recorded names was Septentrionalis Oceanus  or  Northern Ocean   which was cited by Pliny  The name  North Sea  probably came into English  however  via the Dutch  Noordzee   who named it thus either in contrast with the Zuiderzee   South Sea    located south of Frisia  or simply because the sea is generally to the north of the Netherlands  Before the adoption of  North Sea   the names used in English were  German Sea  or  German Ocean   the latter referred to the Latin name  Oceanus Germanicus   and they persisted even into the 1830s   Other common names in use for long periods were the Latin terms Mare Frisicum  as well as their English equivalents   Frisian Sea    5 2  Early history  The North Sea has provided waterway access for commerce and conquest  Many areas have access to the North Sea with its long coastline and European rivers that empty into it  The British Isles had been protected from invasion by the North Sea waters until the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE  The Romans established organised ports  shipping increased and sustained trade began  When the Romans abandoned Britain in 410 the Germanic Angles  Saxons  and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea during the Migration Period invading England   The Viking Age began in 793 with the attack on Lindisfarne and for the next quarter millennium the Vikings ruled the North Sea  In their superior longships  they raided  traded  and established colonies and outposts on the Sea s coasts  From the Middle Ages through the 15th century  the northern European coastal ports exported domestic goods  dyes  linen  salt  metal goods and wine  The Scandinavian and Baltic areas shipped grain  fish  naval necessities  and timber  In turn the North Sea countries imported high grade cloths  spices  and fruits from the Mediterranean region Commerce during this era was mainly undertaken by maritime trade due to underdeveloped roadways   In the 13th century the Hanseatic League  though centred on the Baltic Sea  started to control most of the trade through important members and outposts on the North Sea  The League lost its dominance in the 16th century  as neighbouring states took control of former Hanseatic cities and outposts and internal conflict prevented effective cooperation and defence  Furthermore  as the League lost control of its maritime cities  new trade routes emerged that provided Europe with Asian  American  and African goods   5 3  Age of sail  The 17th century Dutch Golden Age during which Dutch herring  cod and whale fisheries reached an all time high saw Dutch power at its zenith  Important overseas colonies  a vast merchant marine  powerful navy and large profits made the Dutch the main challengers to an ambitious England  This rivalry led to the first three Anglo Dutch Wars between 1652 and 1673  which ended with Dutch victories  After the Glorious Revolution the Dutch prince William ascended to the English throne  With both countries united  commercial  military  and political power shifted from Amsterdam to London  The British did not face a challenge to their dominance of the North Sea until the 20th century   5 4  Modern era  Tensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the Dogger Bank incident  During the Russo Japanese War  several ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet  which was on its way to the Far East  mistook British fishing boats for Japanese ships and fired on them  and then upon each other  near the Dogger Bank  nearly causing Britain to enter the war on the side of Japan   During the First World War  Great Britain s Grand Fleet and Germany s Kaiserliche Marine faced each other in the North Sea  which became the main theatre of the war for surface action  Britain s larger fleet and North Sea Mine Barrage were able to establish an effective blockade for most of the war  which restricted the Central Powers  access to many crucial resources  Major battles included the Battle of Heligoland Bight  the Battle of the Dogger Bank  and the Battle of Jutland  World War I also brought the first extensive use of submarine warfare  and a number of submarine actions occurred in the North Sea   The Second World War also saw action in the North Sea  though it was restricted more to aircraft reconnaissance  and action by fighter bomber aircraft  submarines  and smaller vessels such as minesweepers and torpedo boats   In the aftermath the war  hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons were disposed of by being dumped in the North Sea   After the war  the North Sea lost much of its military significance because it is bordered only by NATO member states  However  it gained significant economic importance in the 1960s as the states around the North Sea began full scale exploitation of its oil and gas resources  The North Sea continues to be an active trade route   6  Economy  6 1  Political status  Countries that border the North Sea all claim the of territorial waters  within which they have exclusive fishing rights  The Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union  EU  exists to coordinate fishing rights and assist with disputes between EU states and the EU border state of Norway   After the discovery of mineral resources in the North Sea  the Convention on the Continental Shelf established country rights largely divided along the median line  The median line is defined as the line  every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured   The ocean floor border between Germany  the Netherlands  and Denmark was only reapportioned after protracted negotiations and a judgement of the International Court of Justice   6 2  Oil and gas  As early as 1859  oil was discovered in onshore areas around the North Sea and natural gas as early as 1910   Test drilling began in 1966 and then  in 1969  Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the Ekofisk oil field distinguished by valuable  low sulphur oil  Commercial exploitation began in 1971 with tankers and  after 1975  by a pipeline  first to Teesside  England and then  after 1977  also to Emden  Germany   The exploitation of the North Sea oil reserves began just before the 1973 oil crisis  and the climb of international oil prices made the large investments needed for extraction much more attractive   Although the production costs are relatively high  the quality of the oil  the political stability of the region  and the nearness of important markets in western Europe has made the North Sea an important oil producing region  The largest single humanitarian catastrophe in the North Sea oil industry was the destruction of the offshore oil platform Piper Alpha in 1988 in which 167 people lost their lives   Besides the Ekofisk oil field  the Statfjord oil field is also notable as it was the cause of the first pipeline to span the Norwegian trench  The largest natural gas field in the North Sea  Troll gas field  lies in the Norwegian trench dropping over requiring the construction of the enormous Troll A platform to access it   The price of Brent Crude  one of the first types of oil extracted from the North Sea  is used today as a standard price for comparison for crude oil from the rest of the world  The North Sea contains western Europe s largest oil and natural gas reserves and is one of the world s key non OPEC producing regions   In the UK sector of the North Sea  the oil industry invested £14 4 billion in 2013  and was on track to spend £13 billion in 2014  Industry body Oil & Gas UK put the decline down to rising costs  lower production  high tax rates  and less exploration   6 3  Fishing  The North Sea is Europe s main fishery accounting for over 5% of international commercial fish caught  Fishing in the North Sea is concentrated in the southern part of the coastal waters  The main method of fishing is trawling  In 1995  the total volume of fish and shellfish caught in the North Sea was approximately 3 5 million tonnes  Besides fish  it is estimated that one million tonnes of unmarketable by catch is caught and discarded each year   In recent decades  overfishing has left many fisheries unproductive  disturbing marine food chain dynamics and costing jobs in the fishing industry  Herring  cod and plaice fisheries may soon face the same plight as mackerel fishing  which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing  The objective of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy is to minimize the environmental impact associated with resource use by reducing fish discards  increasing productivity of fisheries  stabilising markets of fisheries and fish processing  and supplying fish at reasonable prices for the consumer   6 4  Mineral resources  In addition to oil  gas  and fish  the states along the North Sea also take millions of cubic metres per year of sand and gravel from the ocean floor  These are used for beach nourishment  land reclamation and construction  Rolled pieces of amber may be picked up on the east coast of England   6 5  Renewable energy  Due to the strong prevailing winds  countries on the North Sea  particularly Germany and Denmark  have used the shore for wind power since the 1990s  The North Sea is the home of one of the first large scale offshore wind farms in the world  Horns Rev 1  completed in 2002  Since then many other wind farms have been commissioned in the North Sea  and elsewhere   including the two largest windfarms in the world as of September 2010  Thanet in the UK and Horns Rev 2 in Denmark   The expansion of offshore wind farms has met with some resistance  Concerns have included shipping collisions and environmental effects on ocean ecology and wildlife such as fish and migratory birds  however  these concerns were found to be negligible in a long term study in Denmark released in 2006 and again in a UK government study in 2009  There are also concerns about reliability  and the rising costs of constructing and maintaining offshore wind farms  Despite these  development of North Sea wind power is continuing  with plans for additional wind farms off the coasts of Germany  the Netherlands  and the UK  There have also been proposals for a transnational power grid in the North Sea to connect new offshore wind farms   Energy production from tidal power is still in a pre commercial stage  The European Marine Energy Centre has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday  Since 2003  a prototype Wave Dragon energy converter has been in operation at Nissum Bredning fjord of northern Denmark   6 6  Tourism  The beaches and coastal waters of the North Sea are popular destinations for tourists  The Belgian  Dutch  German and Danish coasts are especially developed for tourism  The North Sea coast of the United Kingdom is also a well developed tourist destination with beach resorts and is particularly famous for its golfing resorts  The Kingdom of Fife in Scotland being particularly famous for its Golfing coastal links courses  The coastal City of St  Andrews being renowned as the  Home of Golf   The coast of North East England has several tourist towns such as Scarborough  Bridlington  Seahouses  Whitby  Robin Hood s Bay & Seaton Carew  The coast of North East England has long sandy beaches and famous links golfing locations such as Seaton Carew Golf Club and Goswick Golf Club  The North Sea Trail is a long distance trail linking seven countries around the North Sea  Windsurfing and sailing are popular sports because of the strong winds  Mudflat hiking  recreational fishing and birdwatching are among other popular activities   The climatic conditions on the North Sea coast are often claimed to be especially healthful  As early as the 19th century  travellers used their stays on the North Sea coast as curative and restorative vacations  The sea air  temperature  wind  water  and sunshine are counted among the beneficial conditions that are said to activate the body s defences  improve circulation  strengthen the immune system  and have healing effects on the skin and the respiratory system   6 7  Marine traffic  The North Sea is important for marine transport and its shipping lanes are among the busiest in the world  Major ports are located along its coasts  Rotterdam  the busiest port in Europe and the fourth busiest port in the world by tonnage   Antwerp  was 16th  and Hamburg  was 27th   Bremen Bremerhaven and Felixstowe  both in the top 30 busiest container seaports  as well as the Port of Bruges Zeebrugge  Europe s leading RoRo port   Fishing boats  service boats for offshore industries  sport and pleasure craft  and merchant ships to and from North Sea ports and Baltic ports must share routes on the North Sea  The Dover Strait alone sees more than 400 commercial vessels a day  Because of this volume  navigation in the North Sea can be difficult in high traffic zones  so ports have established elaborate vessel traffic services to monitor and direct ships into and out of port   The North Sea coasts are home to numerous canals and canal systems to facilitate traffic between and among rivers  artificial harbours  and the sea  The Kiel Canal  connecting the North Sea with the Baltic Sea  is the most heavily used artificial seaway in the world reporting an average of 89 ships per day not including sporting boats and other small watercraft in 2009  It saves an average of   instead of the voyage around the Jutland Peninsula  The North Sea Canal connects Amsterdam with the North Sea   7  See also
