Mozambique is located on the east coast of southern Africa  Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons  a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September   1  Physical Features  The coastline extends from 26° 52  S  to 10° 40  S   and from south to north makes a double curve with a general trend outward to the east  It has a length of   Some north of the South African frontier is the deep indentation of Delagoa Bay  The land then turns outward to Cape Corrientes  a little north of which is Inhambane Bay  Bending westward again and passing the Bazaruto Archipelago of several small islands  of which the chief is Bazaruto  Sofala Bay is reached   Northward the Zambezi River with a wide delta pours its waters into the ocean  From this point onward the coast is studded with small islands  mainly of coral formation  On one of these islands is Mozambique  and immediately north of that port is Conducia Bay  Somewhat farther north are two large bays  Fernao Veloso and Memba  There is a great difference in the character of the coast north and south of Mozambique  To the north the coast is much indented  abounds in rocky headlands and rugged cliffs while  as already stated  there is an almost continuous fringe of islands   In southern Mozambique the coastline is low  sandy and contains swamps of East African mangroves  Harbours are few and poor  The difference in character of these two regions arises from the fact that in the northern half the ocean current which flows south between Madagascar and the mainland is close to the coast  and scours out all the softer material  while at the same time the corals are building in deep waters  North of Fernao Veloso and Memba the largest bays are Pemba  where there is commodious anchorage for heavy draught vessels   Montepuesi and Tunghi  the last named having for its northern arm Cape Delgado  the northernmost point on Mozambique s coast   Orographically the backbone of the country is the mountain chain which forms the eastern escarpment of the continental plateau  It does not present a uniformly abrupt descent to the plains  but in places  as in the lower Zambezi district  slopes gradually to the coast  The Lebombo Mountains  behind Delagoa Bay  nowhere exceed in height  the Manica Plateau  farther north  is higher  Mt Doe rises to and Mt Panga to The Gorongoza massif with Mt Miranga     Enhatete     and Gogogo    lies north east of the Manica plateau  and is  like it  of granitic formation  Gorongoza  rising isolated with precipitous outer slopes  has been likened in its aspect to a frowning citadel   The chief mountain range lies north of the Zambezi  and east of Lake Chilwa  namely  the Namuli Mountains  in which Namuli Peak rises to   and Molisani  Mruli and Mresi attain altitudes of These mountains are covered with magnificent forests  Farther north the river basins are divided by well marked ranges with heights of and over  Near the south east shore of Lake Malawi there is a high range   with an abrupt descent to the lake   some in   The country between Malawi and Ibo is remarkable for the number of fantastically shaped granite peaks which rise from the plateau   The plateau lands west of the escarpment are of moderate elevation   perhaps averaging It is  however  only along the Zambezi and north of that river that Mozambique s territory reaches to the continental plateau  This northern plain has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Eastern Miombo woodlands ecoregion   Besides the Zambezi  the most considerable river in Mozambique is the Limpopo which enters the Indian Ocean about north of Delagoa Bay  The Komati  Save  Busi and Pungwe south of the Zambezi  the Lukugu  Lurio  Montepuesi  Mtepwesi  and Msalu  with the Rovuma and its affluent the Lujenda  to the north of it  are the other rivers of the province with considerable drainage areas  The Save  Sabi  rises in Zimbabwe at an altitude of over   and after flowing south for over turns east and pierces the mountains some from the coast  being joined near the Zimbabwe Mozambique frontier by the Lundi  Cataracts entirely prevent navigation above this point   Below the Lundi confluence the bed of the Sabi becomes considerably broader  varying from half a mile to two miles  3 km   In the rainy season the Save is a large stream and even in the   dries   it can be navigated from its mouth by shallow draught steamers for over 150 m  Its general direction through Portuguese territory is east by north  At its mouth it forms a delta in extent  The Busi  220 m  and Pungwe  180 m  are streams north of and similar in character to the Save  They both rise in the Manica plateau and enter the ocean in Pungwe Bay  their mouths a mile or two apart   The lower reaches of both streams are navigable  the Busi for   the Pungwe for about   At the mouth of the Pungwe is the port of Beira  Of the north Zambezi streams the Lukugu  rising in the hills south east of Lake Chilwa  flows south and enters the ocean not far north of Quelimane  The Lurio  rising in the Namuli Mountains  flows north east  having a course of some   The Montepuesi and the Msalu drain the country between the Lurio and Rovuma basins  Their banks are in general well defined and the wet season rise seems fairly constant   2  Climate  Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons  a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September  Climatic conditions vary depending on altitude  Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south   Annual precipitation varies from depending on the region with an average of   Cyclones are also common during the wet season  Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from in July to in February   3
