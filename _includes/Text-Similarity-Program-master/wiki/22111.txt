The nuvistor is a type of vacuum tube announced by RCA in 1959  Most nuvistors are basically thimble shaped  but somewhat smaller than a thimble  and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day  Triodes and a few tetrodes were made  The tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic  Making nuvistors requires special equipment  since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope  Instead  the entire structure is assembled  inserted into its metal envelope  sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices   Nuvistors are among the highest performing small signal receiving tubes  They feature excellent VHF and UHF performance plus low noise figures  and were widely used throughout the 1960s in television sets  beginning with RCA s  New Vista  line of color sets in 1961 with the CTC 11 chassis  and radio equipment and high fidelity equipment  primarily in RF sections  They competed with the solid state revolution  and along with GE s Compactron  probably held it at bay for a few years  RCA discontinued their use in television tuners for its product line in late 1971  One famous application was in the Ampex MR 70  a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors  Another limited application of this very small tube was in studio grade microphones from that era  the AKG Norelco C12a  which employed the 7586  being a good example  It was also later found that  with minor circuit modification  the nuvistor made a sufficient replacement for the obsolete Telefunken VF14 tube  used in the famed Neumann U 47 studio microphone   1  Types  7586   First one released  medium mu triode  7587   Sharp cutoff tetrode  8056   triode for low plate voltages  8058   triode  with plate cap & grid on shell  for UHF performance  7895   7586 with higher mu  2CW4   Same as type 6CW4  but with a 2 1 volt   450 milliampere heater  Used in television receivers with series heater strings  6CW4   high mu triode  most common one in consumer electronics  6DS4   remote cutoff 6CW4  6DV4   medium mu  intended as UHF oscillator  shell sometimes gold plated  2  References  3  External links  The Nuvistor
