Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites  The different areas of web design include web graphic design  interface design  authoring  including standardised code and proprietary software  user experience design  and search engine optimization  Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process  although some designers will cover them all  The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front end  client side  design of a website including writing mark up  Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development  Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines   1  History  1 1  1988—2001  Although web design has a fairly recent history  it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design  However web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint  It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives  It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics  different styles of typography  background and music   1 1 1  The start of the web and web design  In 1989  whilst working at CERN Tim Berners Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project  which later became known as the World Wide Web  During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born  Text only pages could be viewed using a simple line mode browser  In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina  created the Mosaic browser  At the time there were multiple browsers  however the majority of them were Unix based and naturally text heavy  There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds  The Mosaic browser broke this mould  The W3C was created in October 1994 to  lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability   This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language  which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole  The W3C continues to set standards  which can today be seen with JavaScript  In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp  that later became known as Netscape Communications  the Netscape 0 9 browser  Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process  For example  Netscape 1 1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages  Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began  as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance  During this time there were many new technologies in the field  notably Cascading Style Sheets  JavaScript  and Dynamic HTML  On the whole  the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace   1 1 2  Evolution of web design  In 1996  Microsoft released its first competitive browser  which was complete with its own features and tags  It was also the first browser to support style sheets  which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique  The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data  However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex  multi column layouts that were otherwise not possible  At this time  as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark up structure  and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility  HTML sites were limited in their design options  even more so with earlier versions of HTML  To create complex designs  many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer  GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing  CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout  This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational  and improved web accessibility  see tableless web design   In 1996  Flash  originally known as FutureSplash  was developed  At the time  the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now  using basic layout and drawing tools  a limited precursor to ActionScript  and a timeline  but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML  animated GIFs and JavaScript  However  because Flash required a plug in  many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility  Instead  designers reverted to gif animations  if they didn t forego using motion graphics altogether  and JavaScript for widgets  But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers  and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites   1 1 3  End of the first browser wars  During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence  enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software  However  they decided to start from the beginning  which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform  The Web Standards Project was formed and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1  Acid2  and Acid3 tests  2000 was a big year for Microsoft  Internet Explorer was released for Mac  this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4 01 and CSS 1  raising the bar in terms of standards compliance  It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format  During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars   1 2  2001—2012  Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives  As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on  There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web  and this has changed how sites are designed   1 2 1  Modern browsers  Since the end of the browsers wars there have been new browsers coming onto the scene  Many of these are open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards  The new options are considered by many to be better than Microsoft s Internet Explorer   1 2 2  New standards  The W3C has released new standards of HTML  HTML5  and CSS  CSS3   as well as new JavaScript API s  each as a new but individual standard  However  while the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and some of the JavaScript API s  it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards  HTML5  CSS3 and JavaScript    2  Tools and technologies  Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in  These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same  Web graphic designers use vector and raster graphics packages to create web formatted imagery or design prototypes  Technologies used to create websites include standardised mark up  which can be hand coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software  There is also proprietary software based on plug ins that bypasses the client’s browser versions  These are often WYSIWYG but with the option of using the software’s scripting language  Search engine optimisation tools may be used to check search engine ranking and suggest improvements   Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their web sites meet web accessibility guidelines   3  Skills and techniques  3 1  Marketing and communication design  Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market  This can be an age group or particular strand of culture  thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience  Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing  meaning  for example  that  B2B  business to business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website  Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation  especially on a B2B website  Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably   3 2  User experience design and interactive design  User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works  This is part of the user experience design  User experience is related to layout  clear instructions and labeling on a website  How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site  If a user perceives the usefulness of the website  they are more likely to continue using it  Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more unique  yet less intuitive or less user friendly website interface useful nonetheless  However  users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface  This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill  Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design   Advanced interactive functions may require plug ins if not advanced coding language skills  Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug ins is a critical decision in user experience design  If the plug in doesn t come pre installed with most browsers  there s a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug in just to access the content  If the function requires advanced coding language skills  it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience  There s also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations  Publishing a function that doesn t work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt  It depends on the target audience if it s likely to be needed or worth any risks   3 3  Page layout  Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout  For example  a designer may consider whether the site s page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design  The most popular fixed width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window  at the current most popular screen resolution  on the current most popular monitor size  Most pages are also center aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens   Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML table based layouts and grid based design in both page layout design principle and in coding technique  but were very slow to be adopted  This was due to considerations of screen reading devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over  Accordingly  a design may be broken down into units  sidebars  content blocks  embedded advertising areas  navigation areas  that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser  as best it can  As the browser does recognize the details of the reader s screen  window size  font size relative to window etc   the browser can make user specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts  but not fixed width layouts  Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units  sidebars may be displaced below body text rather than to the side of it  This is a more flexible display than a hard coded grid based layout that doesn t fit the device window  In particular  the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected  This also minimizes the user s need to horizontally scroll the page   Responsive Web Design is a newer approach  based on CSS3  and a deeper level of per device specification within the page s stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS @media pseudo selector   3 4  Typography  Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style  instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles  Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts  which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications   Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3 1  Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3 5  This has subsequently increased interest in web typography  as well as the usage of font downloading   Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center aligned text   3 5  Motion graphics  The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics  The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website  Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment oriented website  However  a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest  such as business  community  or government  might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes  This doesn t mean that more serious content couldn t be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content  In either case  motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals   3 6  Quality of code  Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards  This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing  Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone  but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately  This includes errors in code  more organized layout for code  and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly  Poorly coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup  Validating via W3C can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made  which is used to highlight errors in code  The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards  This information can then be corrected by the user   4  Homepage design  Usability experts  including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy  have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website  However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage  going directly to internal content pages through search engines  e newsletters and RSS feeds  Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think  Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site s homepage was actually the least important page on a website   In 2012 and 2013  carousels  also called  sliders  and  rotating banners   have become an extremely popular design element on homepages  often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space  Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website s search engine optimisation and usability   5  Occupations  There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website  the web designer and web developer  who often work closely together on a website  The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect  which includes the layout  coloring and typography of a web page  Web designers will also have a working knowledge of using a variety of languages such as HTML  CSS  JavaScript  PHP and Flash to create a site  although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another  Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page  while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone   Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include   Graphic designers to create visuals for the site such as logos  layouts and buttons  Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site  by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet  SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines  Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site  User experience  UX  designer incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture  user centered design  user testing  interaction design  and occasionally visual design   6  See also  6 1  See also  6 2  Related disciplines  7  Notes  8  References and further reading
