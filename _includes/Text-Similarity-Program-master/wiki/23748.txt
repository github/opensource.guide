Photolithography  also termed optical lithography or UV lithography  is a process used in microfabrication to pattern parts of a thin film or the bulk of a substrate  It uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask to a light sensitive chemical  photoresist   or simply  resist   on the substrate  A series of chemical treatments then either engraves the exposure pattern into  or enables deposition of a new material in the desired pattern upon  the material underneath the photo resist  For example  in complex integrated circuits  a modern CMOS wafer will go through the photolithographic cycle up to 50 times   Photolithography shares some fundamental principles with photography in that the pattern in the etching resist is created by exposing it to light  either directly  without using a mask  or with a projected image using an optical mask  This procedure is comparable to a high precision version of the method used to make printed circuit boards  Subsequent stages in the process have more in common with etching than with lithographic printing  It is used because it can create extremely small patterns  down to a few tens of nanometers in size   it affords exact control over the shape and size of the objects it creates  and because it can create patterns over an entire surface cost effectively  Its main disadvantages are that it requires a flat substrate to start with  it is not very effective at creating shapes that are not flat  and it can require extremely clean operating conditions   1  History  The words  photo    litho   and  graphy  all have Greek origins with the meanings  light    stone  and  writing   As suggested by the name  lithography is a printing method where photo suggests the method uses the properties of light to create the prints  Joseph Nicephore Niepce was one of the first people to produce a photograph using such properties  In 1826  Niepce used Bitumen of Judea  a form of asphalt  on a pewter plate to create the image and then mixed lavender oil and minerals to keep the image in place  Years later in 1935  Louis Minsk developed the first negative photoresist  which relied on the solubility of chemicals to determine what part of the surface would remain raised and what parts would dissolve away where the dissolved areas created the image  Five years later  Otto Suess developed the positive photoresist  which worked in the opposite manner   all the remaining raised surfaces created the image  It wasn t until 1954  when Louis Plambeck Jr  developed the Dycryl polymeric letterpress plate  that the process of photo making became quicker   2  Basic procedure  A single iteration of photolithography combines several steps in sequence  Modern cleanrooms use automated  robotic wafer track systems to coordinate the process  The procedure described here omits some advanced treatments  such as thinning agents or edge bead removal   2 1  Cleaning  If organic or inorganic contaminations are present on the wafer surface  they are usually removed by wet chemical treatment  e g  the RCA clean procedure based on solutions containing hydrogen peroxide  Other solutions made with trichloroethylene  acetone or methanol can also be used to clean   2 2  Preparation  The wafer is initially heated to a temperature sufficient to drive off any moisture that may be present on the wafer surface  150°C for ten minutes is sufficient  Wafers that have been in storage must be chemically cleaned to remove contamination  A liquid or gaseous  adhesion promoter   such as Bis trimethylsilyl amine   hexamethyldisilazane   HMDS   is applied to promote adhesion of the photoresist to the wafer  The surface layer of silicon dioxide on the wafer reacts with HMDS to form tri methylated silicon dioxide  a highly water repellent layer not unlike the layer of wax on a car s paint  This water repellent layer prevents the aqueous developer from penetrating between the photoresist layer and the wafer s surface  thus preventing so called lifting of small photoresist structures in the  developing  pattern  In order to ensure the development of the image  it is best covered and placed over a hot plate and let it dry while stabilizing the temperature at 120°C   2 3  Photoresist application  The wafer is covered with photoresist by spin coating  A viscous  liquid solution of photoresist is dispensed onto the wafer  and the wafer is spun rapidly to produce a uniformly thick layer  The spin coating typically runs at 1200 to 4800 rpm for 30 to 60 seconds  and produces a layer between 0 5 and 2 5 micrometres thick  The spin coating process results in a uniform thin layer  usually with uniformity of within 5 to 10 nanometres  This uniformity can be explained by detailed fluid mechanical modelling  which shows that the resist moves much faster at the top of the layer than at the bottom  where viscous forces bind the resist to the wafer surface  Thus  the top layer of resist is quickly ejected from the wafer s edge while the bottom layer still creeps slowly radially along the wafer  In this way  any  bump  or  ridge  of resist is removed  leaving a very flat layer  Final thickness is also determined by the evaporation of liquid solvents from the resist  For very small  dense features    125 or so nm   lower resist thicknesses    0 5 micrometres  are needed to overcome collapse effects at high aspect ratios  typical aspect ratios are   4 1   The photo resist coated wafer is then prebaked to drive off excess photoresist solvent  typically at 90 to 100 °C for 30 to 60 seconds on a hotplate   2 4  Exposure and developing  After prebaking  the photoresist is exposed to a pattern of intense light  The exposure to light causes a chemical change that allows some of the photoresist to be removed by a special solution  called  developer  by analogy with photographic developer  Positive photoresist  the most common type  becomes soluble in the developer when exposed  with negative photoresist  unexposed regions are soluble in the developer   A post exposure bake  PEB  is performed before developing  typically to help reduce standing wave phenomena caused by the destructive and constructive interference patterns of the incident light  In deep ultraviolet lithography  chemically amplified resist  CAR  chemistry is used  This process is much more sensitive to PEB time  temperature  and delay  as most of the  exposure  reaction  creating acid  making the polymer soluble in the basic developer  actually occurs in the PEB   The develop chemistry is delivered on a spinner  much like photoresist  Developers originally often contained sodium hydroxide  NaOH   However  sodium is considered an extremely undesirable contaminant in MOSFET fabrication because it degrades the insulating properties of gate oxides  specifically  sodium ions can migrate in and out of the gate  changing the threshold voltage of the transistor and making it harder or easier to turn the transistor on over time   Metal ion free developers such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide  TMAH  are now used   The resulting wafer is then  hard baked  if a non chemically amplified resist was used  typically at 120 to 180 °C for 20 to 30 minutes  The hard bake solidifies the remaining photoresist  to make a more durable protecting layer in future ion implantation  wet chemical etching  or plasma etching   2 5  Etching  In etching  a liquid   wet   or plasma   dry   chemical agent removes the uppermost layer of the substrate in the areas that are not protected by photoresist  In semiconductor fabrication  dry etching techniques are generally used  as they can be made anisotropic  in order to avoid significant undercutting of the photoresist pattern  This is essential when the width of the features to be defined is similar to or less than the thickness of the material being etched  i e  when the aspect ratio approaches unity   Wet etch processes are generally isotropic in nature  which is often indispensable for microelectromechanical systems  where suspended structures must be  released  from the underlying layer   The development of low defectivity anisotropic dry etch process has enabled the ever smaller features defined photolithographically in the resist to be transferred to the substrate material   2 6  Photoresist removal  After a photoresist is no longer needed  it must be removed from the substrate  This usually requires a liquid  resist stripper   which chemically alters the resist so that it no longer adheres to the substrate  Alternatively  photoresist may be removed by a plasma containing oxygen  which oxidizes it  This process is called ashing  and resembles dry etching  1 Methyl 2 pyrrolidon  NMP  solvent is another method used to remove an image  NMP is soluble with photoresist and has a high boiling point  thus when the resist has dissolved off the solution and wafer can be heated up to 80°C without leaving any residue   3  Exposure   printing   systems  Exposure systems typically produce an image on the wafer using a photomask  The light shines through the photomask  which blocks it in some areas and lets it pass in others   Maskless lithography projects a precise beam directly onto the wafer without using a mask  but it is not widely used in commercial processes   Exposure systems may be classified by the optics that transfer the image from the mask to the wafer   3 1  Contact and proximity  A contact printer  the simplest exposure system  puts a photomask in direct contact with the wafer and exposes it to a uniform light  A proximity printer puts a small gap between the photomask and wafer  In both cases  the mask covers the entire wafer  and simultaneously patterns every die   Contact printing is liable to damage both the mask and the wafer  and this was the primary reason it was abandoned for high volume production  Both contact and proximity lithography require the light intensity to be uniform across an entire wafer  and the mask to align precisely to features already on the wafer  As modern processes use increasingly large wafers  these conditions become increasingly difficult   Research and prototyping processes often use contact or proximity lithography  because it uses inexpensive hardware and can achieve high optical resolution  The resolution in proximity lithography is approximately the square root of the product of the wavelength and the gap distance  Hence  except for projection lithography  see below   contact printing offers the best resolution  because its gap distance is approximately zero  neglecting the thickness of the photoresist itself   In addition  nanoimprint lithography may revive interest in this familiar technique  especially since the cost of ownership is expected to be low  however  the shortcomings of contact printing discussed above remain as challenges   3 2  Projection  Very large scale integration  VLSI  lithography uses projection systems  Unlike contact or proximity masks  which cover an entire wafer  projection masks  known as  reticles   show only one die or an array of dice  known as a  field    Projection exposure systems  steppers or scanners  project the mask onto the wafer many times to create the complete pattern   4  Photomasks  The image for the mask originates from a computerized data file  This data file is converted to a series of polygons and written onto a square fused quartz substrate covered with a layer of chromium using a photolithographic process  A laser beam  laser writer  or a beam of electrons  e beam writer  is used to expose the pattern defined by the data file and travels over the surface of the substrate in either a vector or raster scan manner  Where the photoresist on the mask is exposed  the chrome can be etched away  leaving a clear path for the illumination light in the stepper scanner system to travel through   5  Resolution in projection systems  The ability to project a clear image of a small feature onto the wafer is limited by the wavelength of the light that is used  and the ability of the reduction lens system to capture enough diffraction orders from the illuminated mask  Current state of the art photolithography tools use deep ultraviolet  DUV  light from excimer lasers with wavelengths of 248 and 193 nm  the dominant lithography technology today is thus also called  excimer laser lithography    which allow minimum feature sizes down to 50 nm  Excimer laser lithography has thus played a critical role in the continued advance of the so called Moore’s Law for the last 20 years  see below    The minimum feature size that a projection system can print is given approximately by   where  is the minimum feature size  also called the critical dimension  target design rule   It is also common to write 2 times the half pitch    commonly called k1 factor  is a coefficient that encapsulates process related factors  and typically equals 0 4 for production  The minimum feature size can be reduced by decreasing this coefficient through Computational lithography   is the wavelength of light used  is the numerical aperture of the lens as seen from the wafer  According to this equation  minimum feature sizes can be decreased by decreasing the wavelength  and increasing the numerical aperture  to achieve a tighter focused beam and a smaller spot size   However  this design method runs into a competing constraint  In modern systems  the depth of focus is also a concern   Here  is another process related coefficient  The depth of focus restricts the thickness of the photoresist and the depth of the topography on the wafer  Chemical mechanical polishing is often used to flatten topography before high resolution lithographic steps   6  Light sources  Historically  photolithography has used ultraviolet light from gas discharge lamps using mercury  sometimes in combination with noble gases such as xenon  These lamps produce light across a broad spectrum with several strong peaks in the ultraviolet range  This spectrum is filtered to select a single spectral line  From the early 1960s through the mid 1980s  Hg lamps had been used in lithography for their spectral lines at 436 nm   g line    405 nm   h line   and 365 nm   i line    However  with the semiconductor industry’s need for both higher resolution  to produce denser and faster chips  and higher throughput  for lower costs   the lamp based lithography tools were no longer able to meet the industry’s requirements   This challenge was overcome when in a pioneering development in 1982  excimer laser lithography was proposed and demonstrated at I B M  by Kanti Jain  and now excimer laser lithography machines  steppers and scanners  are the primary tools used worldwide in microelectronics production  With phenomenal advances made in tool technology in the last two decades  it is the semiconductor industry view that excimer laser lithography has been a crucial factor in the continued advance of Moore’s Law  enabling minimum features sizes in chip manufacturing to shrink from 0 5 micrometer in 1990 to 45 nanometers and below in 2010  This trend is expected to continue into this decade for even denser chips  with minimum features approaching 10 nanometers  From an even broader scientific and technological perspective  in the 50 year history of the laser since its first demonstration in 1960  the invention and development of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones   The commonly used deep ultraviolet excimer lasers in lithography systems are the krypton fluoride laser at 248 nm wavelength and the argon fluoride laser at 193 nm wavelength  The primary manufacturers of excimer laser light sources in the 1980s were Lambda Physik  now part of Coherent  Inc   and Lumonics  Since the mid 1990s Cymer Inc  has become the dominant supplier of excimer laser sources to the lithography equipment manufacturers  with Gigaphoton Inc  as their closest rival  Generally  an excimer laser is designed to operate with a specific gas mixture  therefore  changing wavelength is not a trivial matter  as the method of generating the new wavelength is completely different  and the absorption characteristics of materials change  For example  air begins to absorb significantly around the 193 nm wavelength  moving to sub 193 nm wavelengths would require installing vacuum pump and purge equipment on the lithography tools  a significant challenge   Furthermore  insulating materials such as silicon dioxide  when exposed to photons with energy greater than the band gap  release free electrons and holes which subsequently cause adverse charging   Optical lithography has been extended to feature sizes below 50 nm using the 193 nm ArF excimer laser and liquid immersion techniques  Also termed immersion lithography  this enables the use of optics with numerical apertures exceeding 1 0  The liquid used is typically ultra pure  deionised water  which provides for a refractive index above that of the usual air gap between the lens and the wafer surface  The water is continually circulated to eliminate thermally induced distortions  Water will only allow NA s of up to ~1 4  but materials with higher refractive indices will allow the effective NA to be increased further   Experimental tools using the 157 nm wavelength from the F2 excimer laser in a manner similar to current exposure systems have been built  These were once targeted to succeed 193 nm lithography at the 65 nm feature size node but have now all but been eliminated by the introduction of immersion lithography  This was due to persistent technical problems with the 157 nm technology and economic considerations that provided strong incentives for the continued use of 193 nm excimer laser lithography technology  High index immersion lithography is the newest extension of 193 nm lithography to be considered  In 2006  features less than 30 nm were demonstrated by IBM using this technique   UV excimer lasers have been demonstrated to about 126 nm  for Ar2*   Excimer lasers are generally preferred to more than the mercury arc lamps because they have a higher resolution  Mercury arc lamps are designed to maintain a steady DC current of 50 to 150 Volts  however the resolution is not optimal  Excimer lasers are gas based light systems that are usually filled with inert and halide gases  Kr  Ar  Xe  F and Cl  that are charged by an electric field  The faster the frequency the greater the resolution of the image  KrF lasers are able to function at a frequency of 4 kHz which is why they are so optimal  In addition to running at a higher frequency  excimer lasers are compatible with more advanced machines than mercury arc lamps are  They are also able to operate from greater distances  up to 25 meters  and are able to maintain their accuracy with a series of mirrors and antireflective coated lenses  By setting up multiple lasers and mirrors  the amount of energy loss is minimized  also since the lenses are coated with antireflective material  the light intensity remains relatively the same from when it left the laser to when it hits the wafer   Lasers have been used to indirectly generate non coherent extreme UV  EUV  light at 13 5 nm for extreme ultraviolet lithography  The EUV light is not emitted by the laser  but rather by a tin or xenon plasma which is excited by an eximer laser  Fabrication of feature sizes of 10 nm has been demonstrated in production environments  but not yet at rates needed for commercialization  However  this is expected by 2016  This technique does not require a synchrotron and EUV sources  as noted  do not produce coherent light  However vacuum systems and a number of novel technologies  including much higher EUV powers than are now produced  are needed to work with UV at the edge of the X ray spectrum  which begins at 10 nm    An option  especially if and when wavelengths continue to decrease to extreme UV or X ray  is the free electron laser  or one might say xaser for an X ray device   These can produce high quality beams at arbitrary wavelengths   7  Experimental methods  Photolithography has been defeating predictions of its demise for many years  For instance  by the early 1980s  many in the semiconductor industry had come to believe that features smaller than 1 micrometer could not be printed optically  Modern techniques using excimer laser lithography already print features with dimensions a fraction of the wavelength of light used – an amazing optical feat  New tricks such as immersion lithography  dual tone resist and multiple patterning continue to improve the resolution of 193 nm lithography  Meanwhile  current research is exploring alternatives to conventional UV  such as electron beam lithography  X ray lithography  extreme ultraviolet lithography and ion projection lithography   8  See also  Alternative types of lithography  Extreme ultraviolet lithography  Nanoimprint lithography  Dip pen nanolithography  Chemical lithography  Soft lithography
