Victoria Claflin Woodhull  later Victoria Woodhull Martin  September 23  1838 – June 9  1927   was an American leader of the woman s suffrage movement   In 1872  Woodhull was the first female candidate for President of the United States  She was also the first woman to start a weekly newspaper and an activist for women s rights and labor reforms  Woodhull was an advocate of free love  by which she meant the freedom to marry  divorce  and bear children without government interference   Woodhull went from rags to riches twice  her first fortune being made on the road as a highly successful magnetic healer before she joined the spiritualist movement in the 1870s  While authorship of many of her articles is disputed  many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull  her backers  and her second husband Colonel James Blood   her role as a representative of these movements was powerful  Together with her sister  she was the first woman to operate a brokerage firm on Wall Street  and they were the first women to found a newspaper  Woodhull & Claflin s Weekly   At her peak of political activity in the early 1870s  Woodhull is best known as the first woman candidate for the United States presidency  which she ran for in 1872 from the Equal Rights Party  supporting women s suffrage and equal rights  Her arrest on obscenity charges a few days before the election for publishing an account of the alleged adulterous affair between the prominent minister Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Tilton added to the sensational coverage of her candidacy  She did not receive any electoral votes  and there is conflicting evidence about popular votes   Many of the reforms and ideals Woodhull espoused for the working class  against what she saw as the corrupt capitalist elite  were extremely controversial in her time  Generations later many of these reforms have been implemented and are now taken for granted  Some of her ideas and suggested reforms are still debated today   1  Early life and education  She was born Victoria California Claflin  the seventh of ten children  six of whom survived to maturity   in the rural frontier town of Homer  Licking County  Ohio  Her mother  Roxanna  Roxy  Hummel Claflin  was illiterate and was illegitimate  She had become a follower of the Austrian mystic Franz Mesmer and the new spiritualist movement  Her father  Reuben  Old Buck  Buckman Claflin  was a con man and snake oil salesman  He came from an impoverished branch of the Massachusetts based Scots American Claflin family  semi distant cousins to Governor William Claflin  Victoria became close to her sister  Tennessee Celeste Claflin  called Tennie   seven years her junior and the last child born to the family  As adults they collaborated in founding a stock brokerage and newspaper in New York City   By age 11  Woodhull had only three years of formal education  but her teachers found her to be extremely intelligent  She was forced to leave school and Homer with her family after her father  after having  insured it heavily   burned the family s rotting gristmill  When he tried to get compensated by insurance  his arson and fraud were discovered  he was run off by a group of town vigilantes  The town held a  benefit  to raise funds to pay for the rest of the family s departure from Ohio   2  First marriage and family  When she was 14  Victoria met 28 year old Canning Woodhull  listed as  Channing  in some records   a doctor from a town outside Rochester  New York  Her family had consulted him to treat the girl for a chronic illness  Woodhull practiced medicine in Ohio at a time when the state did not require formal medical education and licensing  By some accounts  Woodhull claimed to be the nephew of Caleb Smith Woodhull  mayor of New York City from 1849 to 1851  in fact he was a distant cousin   Their marriage certificate was recorded in Cleveland on November 23  1853  when Victoria was two months past her 15th birthday  She soon learned that her new husband was an alcoholic and a womanizer  She often had to work outside the home to support the family  She and Canning had two children  Byron and Zulu  later Zula  Maude  According to one account  Byron was born with an intellectual disability in 1854  a condition Victoria believed was caused by her husband s alcoholism  Another version said his disability resulted from a fall from a window  Woodhull divorced her husband after bearing him two children  and kept his surname   3  Second marriage  About 1866 Woodhull married Colonel James Harvey Blood  who also was marrying for a second time  He had served in the Union Army in Missouri during the American Civil War  and had been elected as city auditor of St  Louis  Missouri  In 1872 Victoria Woodhull started a relationship with the anarchist Benjamin Tucker  which lasted for three years  Woodhull and Blood were divorced in October 1876   4  Free love  Woodhull s support of free love probably originated as she discovered the failings of her first husband  Women who married in the United States during the 19th century were bound into the unions  even if loveless  with few options to escape  Divorce  where possible  was scandalous  and women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society  Victoria Woodhull concluded women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages  She railed against the hypocrisy of society s tolerating married men who had mistresses and engaged in other sexual dalliances  Woodhull believed in monogamous relationships  although she did state she had the right also to love someone else  exclusively  if she desired  She said   In a speech she delivered on Monday  Nov  20  1871 in Steinway Hall  New York City  Woodhull stated her opinion on free love quite clearly   5  Prostitution rumors and stance  Rumors have circulated since the nineteenth century that Woodhull was a prostitute  but no primary evidence exists to support them  Allegedly  these rumors originated in articles published by the Chicago Mail  but no such articles been found  Woodhull personally spoke out against prostitution  and even considered marriage for material gain a form of it  yet her journal  Woodhull & Claflin s Weekly  voiced support for the legalization of sex work  A personal account from a friend of Colonel Blood s suggests that Woodhull s sister Tennie was held against her will in a brothel until Woodhull rescued her  but this story remains unconfirmed   6  Female stockbroker  Woodhull and her sister Tennessee  Tennie  Claflin became the first women stockbrokers and in 1870  opened a brokerage firm on Wall Street  She made a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange  Woodhull  Claflin & Company opened in 1870  with the assistance of the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt  an admirer of Woodhull s skills as a medium  he is rumored to have been her sister Tennie s lover  and to have seriously considered marrying her  Newspapers such as the New York Herald hailed Woodhull and Claflin as  the Queens of Finance  and  the Bewitching Brokers   Many contemporary men s journals  e g   The Days  Doings  published sexualized images of the pair running their firm  although they did not participate in the day to day business of the firm   linking the concept of publicly minded  un chaperoned women with ideas of  sexual immorality  and prostitution   7  Newspaper editor  On the date of May 14  1870  Woodhull and Claflin used the money they had made from their brokerage to found a paper  Woodhull & Claflin s Weekly  its primary purpose to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States  and which published for the next six years  Feminism was the Weekly s primary interest  but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics  advocating among other things sex education  free love  women s suffrage  short skirts  spiritualism  vegetarianism  and licensed prostitution  Histories often state the paper advocated birth control  but some historians disagree  The paper is now known for printing the first English version of Karl Marx s Communist Manifesto in its December 30  1871 edition  and the paper  argued the cause of labor with eloquence and skill  James Blood and Stephen Pearl Andrews wrote the majority of the articles  as well as other able contributors   In 1872  the Weekly published a story that set off a national scandal and preoccupied the public for months  Henry Ward Beecher  a renowned preacher of Brooklyn s Plymouth Church  had condemned Woodhull s free love philosophy in his sermons  But a member of his church  Theodore Tilton  disclosed to Elizabeth Cady Stanton  a colleague of Woodhull  that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing adultery with her  Provoked by such hypocrisy  Woodhull decided to expose Beecher  He ended up standing trial in 1875  for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era  holding the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans  The trial ended with a hung jury   George Francis Train once defended her  Other feminists of her time  including Susan B  Anthony  disagreed with her tactics in pushing for women s equality  Some characterized her as opportunistic and unpredictable  in one notable incident  she had a run in with Anthony during a meeting of the National Women s Suffrage Association  NWSA    The radical NWSA later merged with the conservative American Women s Suffrage Association  AWSA  to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association   8  Women s rights advocate  Woodhull learned how to infiltrate the all male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women s suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee  Woodhull argued that women already had the right to vote — all they had to do was use it — since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens  The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members  Learning of Woodhull s planned address  suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 National Woman Suffrage Association s third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing  Susan B  Anthony  Elizabeth Cady Stanton  and Isabella Beecher Hooker  saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause  They applauded her statement    W omen are the equals of men before the law  and are equal in all their rights    With the power of her first public appearance as a woman s rights advocate  Woodhull moved to the leadership circle of the suffrage movement  Although her Constitutional argument was not original  she focused unprecedented public attention on suffrage  Woodhull was the first woman ever to petition Congress in person  Numerous newspapers reported her appearance before Congress  Frank Leslie s Illustrated Newspaper printed a full page engraving of Woodhull  surrounded by prominent suffragists  delivering her argument   9  First International  Woodhull joined the International Workingmen s Association  also known as the First International  She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper  In the United States  many Yankee radicals  former abolitionists and other progressive activists  became involved in the organization  which had been founded in England  German American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization  and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad based  democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans  In 1871 the Germans expelled most of the English speaking members of the First International s U S  sections  leading to the quick decline of the organization  as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America  Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872  and expressed approval of the expulsions   10  Presidential candidate  Woodhull was nominated for President of the United States by the newly formed Equal Rights Party on May 10  1872  at Apollo Hall  New York City  A year earlier  she had announced her intention to run  Also in 1871  she spoke publicly against the government being composed only of men  she proposed developing a new constitution and a new government a year thence  Her nomination was ratified at the convention on June 6  1872  They nominated the former slave and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass for Vice President  He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination  He served as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York  This made her the first woman candidate   While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States  some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run  They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35  However  election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue  Biographer Mary L  Shearer  a descendant of Colonel Blood and researcher of Woodhull s life  has not found one article that discusses her age as an issue in the election  The presidential inauguration was in March 1873  Woodhull s 35th birthday was in September 1873   Woodhull s campaign was also notable for the nomination of Frederick Douglass  although he did not take part in it  His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of whites and blacks in public life and fears of miscegenation  especially as he had married a much younger white woman after his first wife died   The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African American civil rights activists  as the exclusion of female suffrage from the Fifteenth Amendment two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups   Having been vilified in the media for her support of free love  Woodhull devoted an issue of Woodhull & Claflin s Weekly  November 2  1872  to an alleged adulterous affair between Elizabeth Tilton and Reverend Henry Ward Beecher  a prominent Protestant minister in New York  he supported female suffrage but had lectured against free love in his sermons   Woodhull published the article to highlight what she saw as a sexual double standard between men and women   That same day  a few days before the presidential election  U S  Federal Marshals arrested Woodhull  her second husband Colonel James Blood  and her sister Tennie C  Claflin on charges of  publishing an obscene newspaper  because of the content of this issue  The sisters were held in the Ludlow Street Jail for the next month  a place normally reserved for civil offenses  but which contained more hardened criminals as well  The arrest was arranged by Anthony Comstock  the self appointed moral defender of the nation at the time  Opponents raised questions about censorship and government persecution  The three were acquitted on a technicality six months later  but the arrest prevented Woodhull from attempting to vote during the 1872 presidential election  With the publication of the scandal  Theodore Tilton  the husband of Elizabeth  sued Beecher for  alienation of affection   The trial in 1875 was sensationalized across the nation  and eventually resulted in a hung jury   Woodhull again tried to gain nominations for the presidency in 1884 and 1892  Newspapers reported that her 1892 attempt culminated in her nomination by the  National Woman Suffragists  Nominating Convention  on September 21 of that year  Mary L  Stowe of California was nominated as the candidate for vice president  The convention was held at Willard s Hotel in Boonville  New York  and Anna M  Parker was its president  Some woman s suffrage organizations repudiated the nominations  however  claiming that the nominating committee was unauthorized  Woodhull was quoted as saying that she was  destined  by  prophecy  to be elected President of the United States in the upcoming election   11  Life in England and third marriage  In October 1876  Woodhull divorced her second husband  Colonel Blood  Less than a year later  exhausted and possibly depressed  she left for England to start a new life  She made her first public appearance as a lecturer at St  James s Hall in London on December 4  1877  Her lecture was called  The Human Body  the Temple of God   a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States  Present at one of her lectures was the banker John Biddulph Martin  They began to see each other and married on October 31  1883   His family disapproved of his marriage    From then on  she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin  Under that name  she published the magazine  The Humanitarian  from 1892 to 1901  with help from her daughter Zula Woodhull  After her husband died in 1901  Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country  establishing residence at Bredon s Norton   12  Death  Woodhull  by then Martin  died on June 10  1927  at Norton Park in Bredon s Norton  Worcestershire  near Tewkesbury  England  United Kingdom   13  Legacy and honors  A cenotaph of Victoria Woodhull Martin is located at Tewkesbury Abbey   The Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance is a human rights sexual freedom advocacy organization named in honor of Victoria Woodhull   The Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership was founded by Naomi Wolf and Margot Magowan in 1997   She was honored by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March 2008 and was included in a map of historical sites related or dedicated to important women   The 1980 Broadway musical Onward Victoria was inspired by Woodhull s life   Victoria Bond composed the opera Mrs  President about Woodhull  It premiered in 2012 in Anchorage  Alaska   In 2001  Victoria Woodhull was inducted posthumously into the National Women s Hall of Fame   14  See also  List of civil rights leaders  List of suffragists and suffragettes  List of women s rights activists  Ezra Heywood  Swami Laura Horos  Onward Victoria
