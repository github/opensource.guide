A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestor  called the proto language of that family  The term  family  reflects the tree model of language origination in historical linguistics  which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological family tree  or in a subsequent modification  to species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy  No actual biological relationship between speakers is implied by the metaphor   Estimates of the number of living languages vary from 5 000 to 8 000  depending on the precision of one s definition of  language   and in particular on how one classifies dialects  The 2013 edition of Ethnologue catalogs just over 7 000 living human languages  A  living language  is simply one that is used as the primary form of communication of a group of people  There are also many dead and extinct languages  as well as some that are still insufficiently studied to be classified  or even unknown outside their respective speech communities   Membership of languages in a language family is established by comparative linguistics  Sister languages are said to have a  genetic  or  genealogical  relationship  The latter is older  but has been revived in recent years to better distinguish the relationships between languages from the genetic relationships between people  The evidence of linguistic relationship is found in observable shared characteristics that are not attributed to contact or borrowing  Genealogically related languages present shared retentions  that is  features of the proto language  or reflexes of such features  that cannot be explained by chance or borrowing  convergence   Membership in a branch or group within a language family is established by shared innovations  that is  common features of those languages that are not found in the common ancestor of the entire family  For example  Germanic languages are  Germanic  in that they share vocabulary and grammatical features that are not believed to have been present in the Proto Indo European language  These features are believed to be innovations that took place in Proto Germanic  a descendant of Proto Indo European that was the source of all Germanic languages   1  Structure of a family  Language families can be divided into smaller phylogenetic units  conventionally referred to as branches of the family because the history of a language family is often represented as a tree diagram  A family is a monophyletic unit  that is  all its members derive from a common ancestor  and all attested descendants of that ancestor are included in the family   In this way  the term family is analogous to the biological term clade   Some taxonomists restrict the term family to a certain level  but there is little consensus in how to do so  Those who affix such labels also subdivide branches into groups  and groups into complexes  A top level  largest  family is often called a phylum or stock  The term macrofamily or superfamily is sometimes applied to proposed groupings of language families whose status as phylogenetic units is generally considered to be unsubstantiated by accepted historical linguistic methods   For example  the Celtic  Germanic  Slavic  Romance  and Indo Iranian language families are branches of a larger Indo European language family  There is a remarkably similar pattern shown by the linguistic tree and the genetic tree of human ancestry that was verified statistically  Languages interpreted in terms of the putative phylogenetic tree of human languages are transmitted to a great extent vertically  i e  by ancestry  as opposed to horizontally  i e  by spatial diffusion    1 1  Dialect continua  Some closely knit language families  and many branches within larger families  take the form of dialect continua  in which there are no clear cut borders that make it possible to unequivocally identify  define  or count individual languages within the family  However  when the differences between the speech of different regions at the extremes of the continuum are so great that there is no mutual intelligibility between them  the continuum cannot meaningfully be seen as a single language  A speech variety may also be considered either a language or a dialect depending on social or political considerations  Thus different sources give sometimes wildly different accounts of the number of languages within a family  Classifications of the Japonic family  for example  range from one language  a language isolate  to nearly twenty   1 2  Proto languages  The common ancestor of a language family is seldom known directly  since most languages have a relatively short recorded history  However  it is possible to recover many features of a proto language by applying the comparative method—a reconstructive procedure worked out by 19th century linguist August Schleicher  This can demonstrate the validity of many of the proposed families in the list of language families  For example  the reconstructible common ancestor of the Indo European language family is called Proto Indo European  Proto Indo European is not attested by written records  and so it is conjectured to have been spoken before the invention of writing   Sometimes  however  a proto language can be identified with a historically known language  For instance  dialects of Old Norse are the proto language of Norwegian  Swedish  Danish  Faroese and Icelandic  Likewise  the Appendix Probi depicts Proto Romance  a language almost unattested due to the prestige of Classical Latin  a highly stylised literary register not representative of the speech of ordinary people   2  Other classifications of languages  2 1  Isolate  Most of the world s languages are known to belong to language families  Those that have no known relatives  or for which family relationships are only tentatively proposed  are called language isolates  which can be thought of as minimal language families  An example is Basque  In general  it is assumed that language isolates have relatives  or had relatives at some point in their history  but at a time depth too great for linguistic comparison to recover them   Languages that cannot be reliably classified into any family are known as language isolates  A language isolated in its own branch within a family  such as Armenian within Indo European  is often also called an isolate  but the meaning of isolate in such cases is usually clarified  For instance  Armenian may be referred to as an Indo European isolate  By contrast  so far as is known  the Basque language is an absolute isolate  It has not been shown to be related to any other language despite numerous attempts  though it has been influenced by neighboring Romance languages  A language may be said to be an isolate currently but not historically if related but now extinct relatives are attested  The Aquitanian language  spoken in Roman times  may have been an ancestor of Basque  but it could also have been a sister language to its ancestor  In the latter case  it would make Basque and Aquitanian form a small family together  ancestors are generally not considered to be distinct languages for this purpose    2 2  Sprachbund  Shared innovations  acquired by borrowing or other means  are not considered genetic and have no bearing with the language family concept  It has been asserted  for example  that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages  Latin  Oscan  Umbrian  etc   might well be  areal features   However  very similar looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto language innovation  and cannot readily be regarded as  areal   either  since English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area   In a similar vein  there are many similar unique innovations in Germanic  Baltic and Slavic that are far more likely to be areal features than traceable to a common proto language  But legitimate uncertainty about whether shared innovations are areal features  coincidence  or inheritance from a common ancestor  leads to disagreement over the proper subdivisions of any large language family   A sprachbund is a geographic area having several languages that feature common linguistic structures  The similarities between those languages are caused by language contact  not by chance or common origin  and are not recognized as criteria that define a language family  An example of a sprachbund would be the Indian Subcontinent   2 3  Contact languages  The concept of language families is based on the historical observation that languages develop dialects  which over time may diverge into distinct languages  However  linguistic ancestry is less clear cut than familiar biological ancestry  in which species do not crossbreed  It is more like the evolution of microbes  with extensive lateral gene transfer  Quite distantly related languages may affect each other through language contact  which in extreme cases may lead to languages with no single ancestor  whether they be creoles or mixed languages  In addition  a number of sign languages have developed in isolation and appear to have no relatives at all  Nonetheless  such cases are relatively rare and most well attested languages can be unambiguously classified as belonging to one language family or another  even if this family s relation to other families is not known   3  See also  Constructed language  Endangered language  Extinct
