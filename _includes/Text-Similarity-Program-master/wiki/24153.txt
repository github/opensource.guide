Pope Celestine II    died 8 March 1144   born Guido di Castello  was Pope from 25 September 1143 to his death in 1144   1  Early life  Guido di Castello  possibly the son of a local noble  Niccolo di Castello  was born either in Città di Castello  situated in Paterna Santa Felicità upon the Apennines  or at Macerata in the March of Ancona   Guido had studied under Pierre Abélard  and eventually became a distinguished master in the schools  Eventually Guido began his career in Rome as a subdeacon and a scriptor apostolicus under Pope Callixtus II  He was created Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pope Honorius II in 1127  as such  he signed the papal bulls issued between 3 April 1130 and 21 December 1133  In the double papal election of 1130 he joined the obedience of Pope Innocent II  In December 1133 Innocent promoted him to the rank of Cardinal Priest of San Marco  He signed the papal bulls as S R E  indignus sacerdos between 11 January 1134 and 16 May 1143  As the cardinal of San Marco’s  he supported Innocent’s claims with regards to Monte Cassino  and as a mark of his confidence in him  Innocent made Guido the rector of Benevento  Afterwards  he made him a papal legate to France in 1140   He participated in the papal election of 1143  the first undisturbed papal election that Rome had seen for eighty two years  and was elected pope two days after the death of Innocent II  on 25 September 1143  taking the name of Celestine   2  Papacy  Celestine II governed the Church for only five months and thirteen days from his election until his death on 8 March 1144  Upon his accession he wrote to Peter the Venerable and the monks of Cluny  asking them to pray for him  while he was congratulated by Arnulf of Lisieux  Regardless of the brevity of his reign  he was prepared to chart a very different course from that of his predecessor  He was opposed to Innocent II’s concessions to King Roger II of Sicily and was in favor of the House of Plantagenet’s claim to the English throne  thus opposed to King Stephen of England  To emphasise this shift  he refused to renew the legatine authority that Innocent II had granted to King Stephen’s brother  Henry of Blois  Celestine also favored the Templars  ordering a general collection for them  as well as the Hospitallers  giving them control of the hospital of Saint Mary Teutonicorum in Jerusalem   The principal act of his papacy was the absolution of Louis VII of France  King Louis had refused to accept the nomination of Pierre de la Chatre as the Archbishop of Bourges  who went to see Innocent II to have his nomination confirmed  When Pierre returned to France in 1142  Louis refused him permission to enter his Episcopal city  causing Pierre to flee to the court of Theobald II  Count of Champagne  Innocent responded by placing France under an interdict  For two years  the various parties remained at loggerheads while Bernard of Clairvaux attempted to mediate the dispute  With the election of Celestine  both Bernard and Theobald appealed to the pope  while Louis sent ambassadors to have the interdict lifted  Louis agreed to accept Pierre as the legitimate Archbishop of Bourges  and in return  Celestine removed the sentence of interdict   Celestine died on 8 March 1144 in the monastery of Saint Sebastian on the Palatine hill and was buried in the south transept of the Lateran  Celestine’s heraldic badge was a lozengy shield of argent and gules   Celestine II is the first pope listed in the Prophecies of St Malachy   3  Sources  Thomas  P  C   A Compact History of the Popes  St Pauls BYB  2007  Mann  Horace K   The Lives of the Popes in the Middle Ages  Vol 9  1925   4  References
