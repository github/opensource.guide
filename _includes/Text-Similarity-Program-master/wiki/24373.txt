Pain is an unpleasant feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli  such as stubbing a toe  burning a finger  putting alcohol on a cut  and bumping the  funny bone   The International Association for the Study of Pain s widely used definition states   Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage  or described in terms of such damage    Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations  to protect a damaged body part while it heals  and to avoid similar experiences in the future  Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed  but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body  and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus  damage or disease   Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most advanced countries such as the United States  It is a major symptom in many medical conditions  and can significantly interfere with a person s quality of life and general functioning  Psychological factors such as social support  hypnotic suggestion  excitement  or distraction can significantly modulate pain s intensity or unpleasantness   1  Classification  In 1994  responding to the need for a more useful system for describing chronic pain  the International Association for the Study of Pain  IASP  classified pain according to specific characteristics   1  region of the body involved  e g  abdomen  lower limbs    2  system whose dysfunction may be causing the pain  e g   nervous  gastrointestinal    3  duration and pattern of occurrence   4  intensity and time since onset  and  5  etiology  This system has been criticized by Clifford J  Woolf and others as inadequate for guiding research and treatment  According to Woolf  there are three classes of pain   nociceptive pain  inflammatory pain which is associated with tissue damage and the infiltration of immune cells  and pathological pain which is a disease state caused by damage to the nervous system  neuropathic pain  or by its abnormal function  dysfunctional pain  like in fibromyalgia  irritable bowel syndrome  tension type headache  etc     1 1  Duration  Pain is usually transitory  lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed  but some painful conditions  such as rheumatoid arthritis  peripheral neuropathy  cancer and idiopathic pain  may persist for years  Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic  and pain that resolves quickly is called acute  Traditionally  the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset  the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain  though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months  Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days  chronic to pain of more than six months duration  and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months  A popular alternative definition of chronic pain  involving no arbitrarily fixed durations is  pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing   Chronic pain may be classified as cancer pain or benign   1 2  Nociceptive  Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers that respond only to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity  nociceptors   and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation  The most common categories being  thermal   e g  heat or cold    mechanical   e g  crushing  tearing  shearing  etc   and  chemical   e g  iodine in a cut  chili powder in the eyes    Nociceptive pain may also be divided into  visceral    deep somatic  and  superficial somatic  pain  Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch  ischemia and inflammation  but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures  such as burning and cutting  Visceral pain is diffuse  difficult to locate and often referred to a distant  usually superficial  structure  It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening  deep  squeezing  and dull  Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments  tendons  bones  blood vessels  fasciae and muscles  and is dull  aching  poorly localized pain  Examples include sprains and broken bones  Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue  and is sharp  well defined and clearly located  Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor  first degree  burns   1 3  Neuropathic  Neuropathic pain is caused by damage or disease affecting any part of the nervous system involved in bodily feelings  the somatosensory system   Peripheral neuropathic pain is often described as  burning    tingling    electrical    stabbing   or  pins and needles   Bumping the  funny bone  elicits acute peripheral neuropathic pain   1 3 1  Phantom  Phantom pain is pain felt in a part of the body that has been lost or from which the brain no longer receives signals  It is a type of neuropathic pain  Phantom limb pain is a common experience of amputees   The prevalence of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%  and in lower limb amputees is 54%  One study found that eight days after amputation  72 percent of patients had phantom limb pain  and six months later  65 percent reported it  Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality  others experience several bouts a day  or it may occur only once every week or two  It is often described as shooting  crushing  burning or cramping  If the pain is continuous for a long period  parts of the intact body may become sensitized  so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb  or phantom limb pain may accompany urination or defecation   Local anesthetic injections into the nerves or sensitive areas of the stump may relieve pain for days  weeks or  sometimes permanently  despite the drug wearing off in a matter of hours  and small injections of hypertonic saline into the soft tissue between vertebrae produces local pain that radiates into the phantom limb for ten minutes or so and may be followed by hours  weeks or even longer of partial or total relief from phantom pain  Vigorous vibration or electrical stimulation of the stump  or current from electrodes surgically implanted onto the spinal cord all produce relief in some patients   Work by Vilayanur S  Ramachandran using mirror box therapy allows for illusions of movement and touch in a phantom limb which in turn cause a reduction in pain   Paraplegia  the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage  may be accompanied by girdle pain at the level of the spinal cord damage  visceral pain evoked by a filling bladder or bowel  or  in five to ten per cent of paraplegics  phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss  This phantom body pain is initially described as burning or tingling but may evolve into severe crushing or pinching pain  fire running down the legs  or a knife twisting in the flesh  Onset may be immediate or may not occur until years after the disabling injury  Surgical treatment rarely provides lasting relief   1 4  Psychogenic  Psychogenic pain  also called psychalgia or somatoform pain  is pain caused  increased  or prolonged by mental  emotional  or behavioral factors  Headache  back pain  and stomach pain are sometimes diagnosed as psychogenic  Sufferers are often stigmatized  because both medical professionals and the general public tend to think that pain from a psychological source is not  real   However  specialists consider that it is no less actual or hurtful than pain from any other source   People with long term pain frequently display psychological disturbance  with elevated scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scales of hysteria  depression and hypochondriasis  the  neurotic triad    Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute pain to turn chronic  but clinical evidence points the other way  to chronic pain causing neuroticism  When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention  scores on the neurotic triad and anxiety fall  often to normal levels  Self esteem  often low in chronic pain patients  also shows improvement once pain has resolved   1 5  Breakthrough pain  Breakthrough pain is transitory acute pain that comes on suddenly and is not alleviated by the patient s normal pain management  It is common in cancer patients who often have background pain that is generally well controlled by medications  but who also sometimes experience bouts of severe pain that from time to time  breaks through  the medication  The characteristics of breakthrough cancer pain vary from person to person and according to the cause  Management of breakthrough pain can entail intensive use of opioids  including fentanyl   1 6  Incident pain  Incident pain is pain that arises as a result of activity  such as movement of an arthritic joint  stretching a wound  etc   1 7  Pain asymbolia and insensitivity  The ability to experience pain is essential for protection from injury  and recognition of the presence of injury  Episodic analgesia may occur under special circumstances  such as in the excitement of sport or war  a soldier on the battlefield may feel no pain for many hours from a traumatic amputation or other severe injury   Although unpleasantness is an essential part of the IASP definition of pain  it is possible to induce a state described as intense pain devoid of unpleasantness in some patients  with morphine injection or psychosurgery  Such patients report that they have pain but are not bothered by it  they recognize the sensation of pain but suffer little  or not at all  Indifference to pain can also rarely be present from birth  these people have normal nerves on medical investigations  and find pain unpleasant  but do not avoid repetition of the pain stimulus   Insensitivity to pain may also result from abnormalities in the nervous system  This is usually the result of acquired damage to the nerves  such as spinal cord injury  diabetes mellitus  diabetic neuropathy   or leprosy in countries where this is prevalent  These individuals are at risk of tissue damage due to undiscovered injury  People with diabetes related nerve damage  for instance  sustain poorly healing foot ulcers as a result of decreased sensation   A much smaller number of people are insensitive to pain due to an inborn abnormality of the nervous system  known as  congenital insensitivity to pain   Children with this condition incur carelessly repeated damage to their tongue  eyes  joints  skin  and muscles  Some die before adulthood  and others have a reduced life expectancy  Most people with congenital insensitivity to pain have one of five hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies  which includes familial dysautonomia and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis   These conditions feature decreased sensitivity to pain together with other neurological abnormalties  particularly of the autonomic nervous system  A very rare syndrome with isolated congenital insensitivity to pain has been linked with mutations in the SCN9A gene  which codes for a sodium channel  Nav1 7  necessary in conducting pain nerve stimuli   2  Effect on functioning  Experimental subjects challenged by acute pain and patients in chronic pain experience impairments in attention control  working memory  mental flexibility  problem solving  and information processing speed  Acute and chronic pain are also associated with increased depression  anxiety  fear  and anger   3  Theory  3 1  Historical theories  Before the relatively recent discovery of neurons and their role in pain  various different body functions were proposed to account for pain  There were several competing early theories of pain among the ancient Greeks  Hippocrates believed that it was due to an imbalance in vital fluids  In the 11th century  Avicenna theorized that there were a number of feeling senses including touch  pain and titillation  but prior to the scientific Renaissance in Europe pain was not well understood  and it was thought that pain originated outside the body  perhaps as a punishment from God   In 1644  René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain  a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual  mystical experience to a physical  mechanical sensation  Descartes s work  along with Avicenna s  prefigured the 19th century development of specificity theory  Specificity theory saw pain as  a specific sensation  with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses   Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory  which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality  but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light  pressure or temperature  By the mid 1890s  specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians  and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists  However  after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey  the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse  and by century s end  most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact   In 1955  DC Sinclair and G Weddell developed peripheral pattern theory  based on a 1934 suggestion by John Paul Nafe  They proposed that all skin fiber endings  with the exception of those innervating hair cells  are identical  and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers  Another 20th century theory was gate control theory  introduced by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in the 1965 Science article  Pain Mechanisms  A New Theory   The authors proposed that both thin  pain  and large diameter  touch  pressure  vibration  nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord  and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell  the less pain is felt  Both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been superseded by more modern theories of pain   3 2  Three dimensions of pain  In 1968 Ronald Melzack and Kenneth Casey described pain in terms of its three dimensions   sensory discriminative   sense of the intensity  location  quality and duration of the pain    affective motivational   unpleasantness and urge to escape the unpleasantness   and  cognitive evaluative   cognitions such as appraisal  cultural values  distraction and hypnotic suggestion   They theorized that pain intensity  the sensory discriminative dimension  and unpleasantness  the affective motivational dimension  are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus  but  higher  cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness  Cognitive activities  may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective motivational dimension  Thus  excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain  while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective motivational dimension and leave the sensory discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed    p  432  The paper ends with a call to action   Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block  surgical intervention and the like  but also by influencing the motivational affective and cognitive factors as well    p  435   3 3  Theory today  Wilhelm Erb s  1874   intensive  theory  that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of any sensory receptor  has been soundly disproved  Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non noxious stimuli  while others  nociceptors  respond only to noxious  high intensity stimuli  At the peripheral end of the nociceptor  noxious stimuli generate currents that  above a given threshold  begin to send signals along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord  The  specificity   whether it responds to thermal  chemical or mechanical features of its environment  of a nociceptor is determined by which ion channels it expresses at its peripheral end  Dozens of different types of nociceptor ion channels have so far been identified  and their exact functions are still being determined   The pain signal travels from the periphery to the spinal cord along an A delta or C fiber  Because the A delta fiber is thicker than the C fiber  and is thinly sheathed in an electrically insulating material  myelin   it carries its signal faster  5–30 m s  than the unmyelinated C fiber  0 5–2 m s   Pain evoked by the  faster  A delta fibers is described as sharp and is felt first  This is followed by a duller pain  often described as burning  carried by the C fibers  These first order neurons enter the spinal cord via Lissauer s tract   A delta and C fibers synapse on second order neurons in substantia gelatinosa  laminae II and III of the dorsal horns   These second order fibers then cross the cord via the anterior white commissure and ascend in the spinothalamic tract  Before reaching the brain  the spinothalamic tract splits into the lateral neospinothalamic tract and the medial paleospinothalamic tract   Second order neospinothalamic tract neurons carry information from A delta fibers and terminate at the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus  where they synapse on third order neurons  dendrites of the somatosensory cortex   Paleospinothalamic neurons carry information from C fibers and terminate throughout the brain stem  a tenth of them in the thalamus and the rest in the medulla  pons and periaqueductal gray matter   Spinal cord fibers dedicated to carrying A delta fiber pain signals  and others that carry both A delta and C fiber pain signals up the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain have been identified  Other spinal cord fibers  known as wide dynamic range neurons  respond to A delta and C fibers  but also to the large A beta fibers that carry touch  pressure and vibration signals  Pain related activity in the thalamus spreads to the insular cortex  thought to embody  among other things  the feeling that distinguishes pain from other homeostatic emotions such as itch and nausea  and anterior cingulate cortex  thought to embody  among other things  the motivational element of pain   and pain that is distinctly located also activates the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices  Melzack and Casey s 1968 picture of the dimensions of pain is as influential today as ever  firmly framing theory and guiding research in the functional neuroanatomy and psychology of pain   A  D   Bud  Craig and Derek Denton include pain in a class of feelings they name  respectively   homeostatic  or  primordial  emotions  These are feelings such as hunger  thirst and fatigue  evoked by internal body states  communicated to the central nervous system by interoceptors  which motivate behavior aimed at maintaining the internal milieu at its ideal state  Craig and Denton distinguish these feelings from the  classical emotions  such as love  fear and anger  which are elicited by environmental stimuli sensed through the nose  eyes and ears   3 4  Evolutionary and behavioral role  Pain is part of the body s defense system  producing a reflexive retraction from the painful stimulus  and tendencies to protect the affected body part while it heals  and avoid that harmful situation in the future  It is an important part of animal life  vital to healthy survival  People with congenital insensitivity to pain have reduced life expectancy   In his book  The Greatest Show on Earth  The Evidence for Evolution  biologist Richard Dawkins grapples with the question of why pain has to be so very painful  He describes the alternative as a simple  mental raising of a  red flag   To argue why that red flag might be insufficient  Dawkins explains that drives must compete with each other within living beings  The most fit creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced  Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt  The relative intensities of pain  then  may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors  lack of food  too much cold  or serious injuries are felt as agony  whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort   This resemblance will not be perfect  however  because natural selection can be a poor designer  The result is often glitches in animals  including supernormal stimuli  Such glitches help explain pains which are not  or at least no longer directly adaptive  e g  perhaps some forms of toothache  or injury to fingernails    Idiopathic pain  pain that persists after the trauma or pathology has healed  or that arises without any apparent cause   may be an exception to the idea that pain is helpful to survival  although some psychodynamic psychologists argue that such pain is psychogenic  enlisted as a protective distraction to keep dangerous emotions unconscious   3 5  Thresholds  In pain science  thresholds are measured by gradually increasing the intensity of a stimulus such as electric current or heat applied to the body  The pain perception threshold is the point at which the stimulus begins to hurt  and the pain tolerance threshold is reached when the subject acts to stop the pain   Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with  among other factors  ethnicity  genetics  and sex  People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful  and Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women  Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds  For instance  patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock  muscle cramp and heat   4  Assessment  A person s self report is the most reliable measure of pain  with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity  A definition of pain widely employed in nursing  emphasizing its subjective nature and the importance of believing patient reports  was introduced by Margo McCaffery in 1968   Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is  existing whenever he says it does   To assess intensity  the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10  with 0 being no pain at all  and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt  Quality can be established by having the patient complete the McGill Pain Questionnaire indicating which words best describe their pain   4 1  Multidimensional pain inventory  The Multidimensional Pain Inventory  MPI  is a questionnaire designed to assess the psychosocial state of a person with chronic pain  Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy  1988  found three classes of chronic pain patient    a  dysfunctional  people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high  reported that pain interfered with much of their lives  reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain  and reported low levels of activity   b  interpersonally distressed  people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems  and  c  adaptive copers  patients who reported high levels of social support  relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference  and relatively high levels of activity   Combining the MPI characterization of the person with their IASP five category pain profile is recommended for deriving the most useful case description   4 2  In nonverbal patients  When a person is non verbal and cannot self report pain  observation becomes critical  and specific behaviors can be monitored as pain indicators  Behaviors such as facial grimacing and guarding indicate pain  as well as an increase or decrease in vocalizations  changes in routine behavior patterns and mental status changes  Patients experiencing pain may exhibit withdrawn social behavior and possibly experience a decreased appetite and decreased nutritional intake  A change in condition that deviates from baseline such as moaning with movement or when manipulating a body part  and limited range of motion are also potential pain indicators  In patients who possess language but are incapable of expressing themselves effectively  such as those with dementia  an increase in confusion or display of aggressive behaviors or agitation  may signal that discomfort exists  and further assessment is necessary   Infants feel pain but they lack the language needed to report it  so communicate distress by crying  A non verbal pain assessment should be conducted involving the parents  who will notice changes in the infant not obvious to the health care provider  Pre term babies are more sensitive to painful stimuli than full term babies   4 3  Other barriers to reporting  The experience of pain has many cultural dimensions  For instance  the way in which one experiences and responds to pain is related to sociocultural characteristics  such as gender  ethnicity  and age  An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would  Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple prescription drugs  Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain  The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much  Decline in self care activities  dressing  grooming  walking  etc   may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain  The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they might become addicted to  They may not want others to see them as weak  or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain  or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions   Cultural barriers can also keep a person from telling someone they are in pain  Religious beliefs may prevent the individual from seeking help  They may feel certain pain treatment is against their religion  They may not report pain because they feel it is a sign that death is near  Many people fear the stigma of addiction and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed potentially addicting drugs  Many Asians do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain and need help  believing the pain should be borne in silence  while other cultures feel they should report pain right away and get immediate relief  Gender can also be a factor in reporting pain  Sexual differences can be the result of social and cultural expectations  with women expected to be emotional and show pain and men stoic  keeping pain to themselves   4 4  As an aid to diagnosis  Pain is a symptom of many medical conditions  Knowing the time of onset  location  intensity  pattern of occurrence  continuous  intermittent  etc    exacerbating and relieving factors  and quality  burning  sharp  etc   of the pain will help the examining physician to accurately diagnose the problem  For example  chest pain described as extreme heaviness may indicate myocardial infarction  while chest pain described as tearing may indicate aortic dissection   4 5  Physiological measurement of pain  fMRI brain scanning has been used to measure pain  giving good correlations with self reported pain   4 6  Hedonic adaptation  Hedonic adaptation means that actual long term suffering due to physical illness is often much lower than expected   4 7  Legal awards for pain and suffering  One area where assessments of pain are effectively required to be made is in legal awards for pain and suffering  In the Western world these are typically discretionary awards made by juries and are regarded as difficult to predict  variable and subjective  for instance in the US  UK  Australia and New Zealand   5  Management  Inadequate treatment of pain is widespread throughout surgical wards  intensive care units  accident and emergency departments  in general practice  in the management of all forms of chronic pain including cancer pain  and in end of life care  This neglect is extended to all ages  from neonates to the frail elderly  African and Hispanic Americans are more likely than others to suffer needlessly in the hands of a physician  and women s pain is more likely to be undertreated than men s   The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates that the relief of pain should be recognized as a human right  that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right  and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty  It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time  Elsewhere  pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology  physiatry  neurology  palliative medicine and psychiatry  In 2011  Human Rights Watch alerted that tens of millions of people worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain   5 1  Medication  Acute pain is usually managed with medications such as analgesics and anesthetics  Caffeine when added to pain medications provides some additional benefit  Management of chronic pain  however  is much more difficult and may require the coordinated efforts of a pain management team  which typically includes medical practitioners  clinical psychologists  physiotherapists  occupational therapists  physician assistants  and nurse practitioners   Sugar taken orally reduces the total crying time but not the duration of the first cry in newborns undergoing a painful procedure  a single lancing of the heel   It does not moderate the effect of pain on heart rate and a recent single study found that sugar did not significantly affect pain related electrical activity in the brains of newborns one second after the heel lance procedure  Sweet oral liquid moderately reduces the incidence and duration of crying caused by immunization injection in children between one and twelve months of age   5 2  Psychological  Individuals with more social support experience less cancer pain  take less pain medication  report less labor pain and are less likely to use epidural anesthesia during childbirth or suffer from chest pain after coronary artery bypass surgery   Suggestion can significantly affect pain intensity  About 35% of people report marked relief after receiving a saline injection they believe to have been morphine  This  placebo  effect is more pronounced in people who are prone to anxiety  so anxiety reduction may account for some of the effect  but it does not account for all of the effect  Placebos are more effective in intense pain than mild pain  and they produce progressively weaker effects with repeated administration   It is possible for many chronic pain sufferers to become so absorbed in an activity or entertainment that the pain is no longer felt  or is greatly diminished   Cognitive behavioral therapy  CBT  is effective in reducing the suffering associated with chronic pain in some patients but the reduction in suffering is quite modest  and the CBT method employed seems to have no effect on outcome   A number of meta analyses have found clinical hypnosis to be effective in controlling pain associated with diagnostic and surgical procedures in both adults and children  as well as pain associated with cancer and childbirth  A 2007 review of 13 studies found evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis in the reduction of chronic pain in some conditions  though the number of patients enrolled in the studies was low  bringing up issues of power to detect group differences  and most lacked credible controls for placebo and or expectation  The authors concluded that  although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain  considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic pain conditions    5 3  Alternative medicine  Pain is the most common reason for people to use complementary and alternative medicine  An analysis of the 13 highest quality studies of pain treatment with acupuncture  published in January 2009 in the British Medical Journal  concluded there is little difference in the effect of real  sham and no acupuncture  There is interest in the relationship between vitamin D and pain  but the evidence so far from controlled trials for such a relationship  other than in osteomalacia  is unconvincing   A 2003 meta analysis of randomized clinical trials found that spinal manipulation was  more effective than sham therapy but was no more or less effective than general practitioner care  analgesics  physical therapy  exercise  or back school  in the treatment of low back pain   6  Epidemiology  Pain is the main reason for visiting the emergency department in more than 50% of cases and is present in 30% of family practice visits  Several epidemiological studies from different countries have reported widely varying prevalence rates for chronic pain  ranging from 12 80% of the population  It becomes more common as people approach death  A study of 4 703 patients found that 26% had pain in the last two years of life  increasing to 46% in the last month   A survey of 6 636 children  0–18 years of age  found that  of the 5 424 respondents  54% had experienced pain in the preceding three months  A quarter reported having experienced recurrent or continuous pain for three months or more  and a third of these reported frequent and intense pain  The intensity of chronic pain was higher for girls  and girls  reports of chronic pain increased markedly between ages 12 and 14   7  Society and culture  The nature or meaning of physical pain has been diversely understood by religious or secular traditions from antiquity to modern times   Physical pain is an important political topic in relation to various issues  including pain management policy  drug control  animal rights or animal welfare  torture  and pain compliance  In various contexts  the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of corporal punishment is used as retribution for an offence  or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer  or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable  In some cultures  extreme practices such as mortification of the flesh or painful rites of passage are highly regarded   Philosophy of pain is a branch of philosophy of mind that deals essentially with physical pain  especially in connection with such views as dualism  identity theory  and functionalism   More generally  it is often as a part of pain in the broad sense  i e  suffering  that physical pain is dealt with in culture  religion  philosophy  or society   8  Other animals  The most reliable method for assessing pain in most humans is by asking a question  a person may report pain that cannot be detected by any known physiological measure  However  like infants  Latin infans meaning  unable to speak    animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain  thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them  Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways  René Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do  Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University  the principal author of two U S  federal laws regulating pain relief for animals  writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain  and that veterinarians trained in the U S  before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain  In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians  he was regularly asked to  prove  that animals are conscious  and to provide  scientifically acceptable  grounds for claiming that they feel pain  Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view  Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal  noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support  some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined  The ability of invertebrate species of animals  such as insects  to feel pain and suffering is also unclear   The presence of pain in an animal cannot be known for certain  but it can be inferred through physical and behavioral reactions  Specialists currently believe that all vertebrates can feel pain  and that certain invertebrates  like the octopus  might too  As for other animals  plants  or other entities  their ability to feel physical pain is at present a question beyond scientific reach  since no mechanism is known by which they could have such a feeling  In particular  there are no known nociceptors in groups such as plants  fungi  and most insects  except for instance in fruit flies   In vertebrates  endogenous opioids are neurochemicals that moderate pain by interacting with opiate receptors  Opioids and opiate receptors occur naturally in crustaceans and  although at present no certain conclusion can be drawn  their presence indicates that lobsters may be able to experience pain  Opioids may mediate their pain in the same way as in vertebrates  Veterinary medicine uses  for actual or potential animal pain  the same analgesics and anesthetics as used in humans   9  Etymology  First attested in English in 1297  the word pain comes from the Old French peine  in turn from Latin poena meaning  punishment  penalty   in L L  also meaning  torment  hardship  suffering   and that from Greek ποινή  poine   generally meaning  price paid  penalty  punishment   It also exists in Frisian as  pine  which in turn is related to the English verb  to pine  which means to long for   10  References  11  External links  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
