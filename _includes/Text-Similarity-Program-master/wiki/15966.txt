Jakob Abbadie  1654  – 25 September 1727   also known as Jacques or James Abbadie  was a Protestant divine and writer  He became Dean of Killaloe  in Ireland   1  Life  Jacques Abbadie was born at Nay  Béarn  probably in 1654  although 1657 and 1658 have been given  he is  most probably the Jacques Abbadie who was the third child of Violente de Fortaner and Pierre Abbadie  baptized on 27 April 1654   Samuel Smiles stated that he was  the scion of a distinguished Béarnese family   although it is probable that the poverty of his parents would have excluded him from a learned career if some of the leading Protestants of the district had not charged themselves with the expenses of his education  which was begun under M  Jean de la Placette  the minister of Nay  He studied at Puylaurens  the Academy of Saumur  and the Academy of Sedan  receiving the degree of doctor in theology  it is said  at the age of seventeen  An obituary notice  however  which appeared in the Daily Courant for 5 October 1727  says   He was not above twenty two when he undertook of himself his admirable treatise on the Truth of the Christian Religion    About the same time he was sent for by Frederick William  Elector of Brandenburg  to be minister of the French church at Berlin  the electoral summons found Abbadie at Paris  and it was conveyed through the Count d Espense  who had been commissioned by his master to make the selection  The congregation of refugees  small enough at first to be accommodated in an apartment of the Count d Espense s residence  grew gradually from increased emigration to Brandenburg  caused by the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685  The elector ordered the ancient chapel of his palace to be prepared for the congregation  and the services were frequently attended by the younger members of his family  Abbadie s arrival in Berlin has been variously assigned to the years 1680 and 1681  During seven or eight years he used his increasing favour with the elector to relieve the distress of the refugees from France  and especially from his native province of Béarn  Abbadie continued to occupy his pastorate at Berlin until the death of the great elector  which took place 29 April 1688   He then accompanied Marshal Schomberg to England in 1688  and the following year became minister of the French church in the Savoy area of London  There William III promoted him to the deanery of Killaloe in Ireland  In the autumn of 1689 he went to Ireland with the marshal   After the battle of the Boyne  Abbadie repaired to London  where he was presently appointed minister of the French church in the Savoy  which had been founded about 1641  Abbadie subsequently published a revised version of the French translation of the English liturgy used at this church  with an epistle dedicatory to George I  He was often appointed to deliver occasional discourses  both in London and Dublin  but his lack of facility in English prevented his preferment in England  and also excluded him from the deanery of St  Patrick s  Dublin  to which William III wished to promote him  Abbadie s health suffered from devotion to his duties in the Savoy and from the English climate  He therefore settled in Ireland  and in 1699 the deanery of Killaloe was conferred upon him by the king  whose special favour he had attracted by a vindication of the Revolution of 1688   The remainder of Abbadie s life was spent in writing and preaching  and in the performance—not too sedulous  for he was frequently absent from his benefice—of the ordinary duties of his office  varied by visits to England and to Holland  where most of his books were printed  Abbadie visited Holland to see his La Vérité through the press  and stayed more than three years in Amsterdam  1720–23  during the preparation of Le Triomphe and other works  He returned to Ireland in 1723  Abbadie s income as dean of Killaloe was so small that he could not afford a literary amanuensis  and Hugh Boulter  archbishop of Armagh  having appealed in vain to Lord Carteret  the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  on Abbadie s behalf  gave him a letter of introduction to Dr  Edmund Gibson  bishop of London  and Abbadie left Ireland  He established himself at Marylebone  He died at his lodgings at Marylebone on Monday  25 September 1727  in aged 74   2  Works  Abbadie is best known by his religious treatises  several of which were translated from the original French into other languages and had a wide circulation throughout Europe  The most important of these are Traite de la verité de la religion chrétienne  1684   its continuation  Traité de la divinité de Jesus Christ  1689   and L Art de se connaitre soi meme  1692    While at Berlin  he made several visits to the Netherlands  in 1684  1686  and 1688  chiefly for the purpose of superintending the printing of several of his works  including the Traité de la Vérité  1684  The book went through a vast number of editions and was translated into several languages  an English version  by Henry Lussan  appearing in 1694  Completed by a third volume  the Traité de la Divinité de Nôtre Seigneur Jésus Christ  it appeared at Rotterdam  1689  An English translation  entitled A Sovereign Antidote against Arian Poyson  appeared in London  1719  and again  revised  corrected  and  in a few places  abridged   by Abraham Booth  under the title of The Deity of Jesus Christ essential to the Christian Religion  1777  The entire apology for Christianity formed by the three volumes of the Traité  which combated severally the heresies of atheism  deism  and Socinianism  was received with praise  La Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne Réformée  1717  was a controversial treatise which in its four parts attacks the characteristic doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church  it was translated into English  for the use of the Roman Catholics of his diocese of Dromore  by Dr  Ralph Lambert  afterwards bishop of Meath  The work was completed in 1723 in Le Triomphe de la Providence et de la Religion  ou  l Ouverture des sept Seaux par le Fils de Dieu  où l on trouvera la première partie de l Apocalypse clairement expliquée par ce qu il y a de plus connu dans l Histoire et de moins contesté dans la Parole de Dieu  Avec une nouvelle et très sensible Démonstration de la Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne   It was in the Irish camp with Schomberg that Abbadie commenced one of his most successful works  which was published at Rotterdam in 1692  as L Art de se connoître soi même  ou  La Recherche des Sources de la Morale  and went through many editions and amplifications  Translations of this work into other languages include a popular English version by the Rev  Thomas Woodcock  The Art of Knowing One self  1694  The last 50 pages of this 274 page work deals with pride  which he divided into five branches  love of esteem  presumptuousness  vanity  ambition and arrogance   Among the early writings of Abbadie were four Sermons sur divers Textes de l Ecriture  1680  Réflexions sur la Présence réelle du Corps de Jésus Christ dans l Eucharistie  1685  and two highly adulatory addresses on persons in high stations  entitled respectively Panégyrique de Monseigneur l Electeur de Brandebourg  1684  and Panégyrique de Marie Stuart  Reine d Angleterre  d Ecosse  de France  et d Irlande  de glorieuse et immortelle mémoire  décédée à Kensington le 28 décembre 1694  1695  also published in England as A Panegyric on our late Sovereign Lady  1695  These four productions  with other occasional sermons  were in 1760 republished collectively  in three volumes  at Amsterdam  and preceded by an Essai historique sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de M  Abbadie  The pamphlet on the Eucharist was also reprinted at Toulouse  in 1835  under the title of Quatre Lettres sur la Trans substantiation  and appeared in an English translation  by John W  Hamersley  as the Chemical Change in the Eucharist  1867   Défense de la Nation Britannique  1693 was an elaborate defence of the Glorious Revolution  written in answer to Pierre Bayle s Avis important aux Réfugiés  1690  He gave a funeral oration on Queen Mary  Abbadie had also written  at the request of the king  Histoire de la dernière Conspiration d Angleterre  1696  a history of the conspiracy of 1696  which was reprinted in Holland and translated into English  and for which the Earl of Portland and Secretary Sir William Trumbull placed original documents at the author s disposal  This work helped Abbadie s preferment  After its production   his majesty sent him to Ireland  with an order to the lords justices to confer upon him some dignity in the church  which order was complied with by his promotion to the deanery of Killalow   Daily Courant  5 October 1727    He revised his works for a complete edition in four volumes  in which were also to be included two unpublished treatises  Nouvelle Manière de prouver l Immortalité de l Ame
