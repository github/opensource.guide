The Battle of Kursk was a World War II engagement between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk   southwest of Moscow  in the Soviet Union during July and August 1943  The German offensive was code named Operation Citadel    and led to one of the largest armoured clashes in history  the Battle of Prokhorovka  The German offensive was countered by two Soviet counter offensives  Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev    and Operation Kutuzov     For the Germans  the battle represented the final strategic offensive they were able to mount in the east  For the Soviets  the decisive victory gave the Red Army the strategic initiative for the rest of the war   The Germans hoped to weaken the Soviet offensive potential for the summer of 1943 by cutting off a large number of forces that they anticipated would be in the Kursk salient assembling for an offensive  The Kursk salient or bulge was 250 km north to south  160 km east to west  By eliminating the Kursk salient they would also shorten their lines of defence  taking the strain off their overstretched forces  The plan envisioned an envelopment by a pair of pincers breaking through the northern and southern flanks of the salient  Hitler thought that a victory here would reassert Germany s strength and improve his prestige with allies who were considering withdrawing from the war  It was also hoped that large numbers of Soviet prisoners would be captured to be used as slave labour in Germany s armaments industry   The Soviets had intelligence of the German intentions  provided in part by British intelligence service and Tunny intercepts  Aware months in advance that the attack would fall on the neck of the Kursk salient  the Soviets built a defence in depth designed to wear down the German panzer spearheads  The Germans delayed the start date of the offensive while they tried to build up their forces and waited for new weapons  mainly the new Panther tank but also larger numbers of the Tiger heavy tank  This gave the Red Army time to construct a series of deep defensive lines  The defensive preparations included minefields  fortifications  pre sighted artillery fire zones and anti tank strong points  which extended approximately in depth  In addition  Soviet mobile formations were moved out of the salient and a large reserve force was formed for strategic counteroffensives   The Battle of Kursk was the first time a German strategic offensive had been halted before it could break through enemy defences and penetrate to its strategic depths   The maximum depth of the Nazi advance was 8 12 km in the north and 35 km in the south   Though the Soviet Army had succeeded in winter offensives previously  their counter offensives following the German attack were their first successful strategic summer offensives of the war   1  Background  As the Battle of Stalingrad slowly ground to its conclusion  the Soviet army moved to a general offensive in the south  pressuring the depleted German forces  Hitler s belief that his own iron will would be the deciding factor in the conflict resulted in German forces being tied down in a rigid defence that did not permit them the liberty to move  Since December  Field Marshall Erich von Manstein had been strongly requesting  unrestricted operational freedom  to allow him to use the forces in a fluid manner  a request which put him at odds with Hitler  Time and again Hitler s policy of holding at all costs resulted in forces being left until their position was untenable  resulting in their being cut off and destroyed  By January 1943  a wide gap had been created between Army Group B and Army Group Don  The advancing Soviet armies threatened to cut off all German forces south of the Don River  including Army Group A operating in the Caucasus  Meanwhile  Army Group Centre was under significant pressure as well  Kursk fell to the Soviets on 8 February  and Rostov on the 14th  The Soviet Bryansk and Western Fronts  along with the newly created Central Front  prepared for an offensive which envisioned an encirclement of Army Group Centre extending between Bryansk and Smolensk   On 12 February  the remaining German forces were reorganized  To the south  Army Group Don was renamed Army Group South and its units placed under the command of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein  Directly to the north  Army Group B was dissolved  and its forces and areas of responsibility were divided between Army Group South and Army Group Centre  With this restructuring von Manstein inherited responsibility for the massive breach in the German lines  January 1943 saw the arrival of the II SS Panzer Corps from France  refitted and up to near full strength  Other armoured units from the 1st Panzer Army  part of Army Group A  which had slipped out of the trap of the Caucasus  further strengthened von Manstein s hand   By February the Wehrmacht was in danger of a general collapse  On 18 February  Adolf Hitler arrived at Army Group South headquarters  at Zaporizhia  hours before Kharkov was liberated by the Soviets  Hitler s distrust of the officers of the General Staff  and of von Manstein in particular  put him at odds with the high command of the Wehrmacht  Though Hitler desired to relieve von Manstein and saddle him with the blame for Stalingrad and subsequent battles  he soon realized he could ill afford to lose the man largely regarded as the most capable commander in the army  Instead  Hitler grudgingly gave him the freedom he had requested  Once given freedom of action  von Manstein explained how he intended to concentrate his forces and make a series of counterstrokes to exploit the overstretched Soviets  with the goal of destroying the Red Army spearheads while retaking Kharkov and Kursk  The Third Battle of Kharkov commenced on 19 February  spearheaded by the three SS divisions of the II SS Panzer Corps  Von Manstein s offensive cut off the Soviet spearheads  and then encircled and destroyed the main force  The Germans retook Kharkov on 15 March and Belgorod on 18 March  The German offensive wrested the initiative from the Soviets  The 25 February offensive by the Central Front against Army Group Centre had to be abandoned by 7 March so that forces could be redeployed south to counter the threat of the advancing Germans  Operations ceased by the end of March due to the onset of the spring rasputitsa and the exhaustion of the Germans  The exhaustion was mirrored in the Red Army  The counteroffensive left a salient extending into the German area of control  centered on the city of Kursk   1 1  German plans and preparation  Heavy losses sustained by the German military in the winters of 1941 42 and 1942 43 resulted in a marked shortage in artillery and infantry  Units along the Eastern Front were 470 000 men below their establishment  For the Germans to undertake an offensive in 1943  the burden would have to be carried by the panzer arm  In view of the exposed position of Army Group South  von Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive  He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donetz River toward the Dnieper  In February  he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then deliver a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks  Hitler  concerned about potential political implications of taking a defensive stance and preoccupied with the economic potential of holding the Donetz basin  rejected this plan  On 10 March  von Manstein presented Hitler with an alternative plan whereby the German forces pinched off the Kursk salient with an offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided  On 13 March  Hitler signed Operational Order No  5  which outlined the intended launch of several offensives  including one against the Kursk salient  As the last Soviet resistance in Kharkov was reduced  von Manstein attempted to persuade Günther von Kluge of Army Group Centre to immediately attack the Central Front  which was defending the northern face of the salient  to keep the Soviets off balance and maintain the momentum  Von Kluge refused  noting that his forces were too weak to launch such an attack  Von Manstein s SS Panzer Corps pushed on northwards and took Belgorod on 18 March  but further advances were blocked by Soviet forces that had been shifted down from the Central Front to an area north of Belgorod  By mid April  amid poor weather and with the German forces exhausted and in need of refitting  the offensives of Operational Order No  5 could not be undertaken   Hitler s Operational Order No  6  issued 15 April  called for the Kursk offensive operation to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter  Kurt Zeitzler  the OKH Chief of Staff  provided the logistical planning for the operation  Zeitzler was a resourceful organizer of strategic moves  and had an exceptional capacity to solve movement problems  For the plan to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets had a chance to prepare extensive defenses or launch an offensive of their own  The plan was codenamed Operation Citadel  According to some military historians  the operation envisioned a blitzkrieg attack  Others state that the operational planning marked a change in German offensive thinking away from blitzkrieg  Some military historians and the German participants who wrote about it after the war  including von Manstein  make no mention of blitzkrieg in their characterization of the operation  The plan for the operation consisted of a double envelopment that was directed at Kursk to surround the majority of the Soviet defenders and seal off the salient  Von Kluge s Army Group Centre was to provide General Walter Model s 9th Army to form the northern pincer  It would cut through the northern face of the salient  driving south to the hills east of Kursk  securing the rail line from Soviet attack  Von Manstein s Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army  under Hermann Hoth  and Army Detachment Kempf  under Werner Kempf  to penetrate the southern face of the salient  This force would drive north to meet 9th Army east of Kursk  Von Manstein s main attack was to be delivered by Hoth s 4th Panzer Army  spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under the command of Paul Hausser  The XLVIII Panzer Corps  commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff  would advance on the left flank of the Waffen SS troops while Army Detachment  Kempf  would advance on the right  The western face of the salient was to be controlled by the 2nd Army  under the command of Walter Weiss   On 27 April  Model met with Hitler to review the reconnaissance information gathered and to express his concerns  He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued  the less the operation could be justified  He recommended Citadel be completely abandoned  allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive  Failing that  he believed that Citadel should be radically revised  Though in mid April von Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable  by May he shared Model s misgivings  He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive  ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle that they excelled at  Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South  he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River  followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance  The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off  This idea was rejected by Hitler  as he did not want to give up so much terrain  even temporarily  Zeitzler was profoundly concerned with the delay till the second week of June  but he was still in support of the offensive   In early May  Hitler called together his senior officers and advisors to Munich for a meeting  Hitler spoke for about 45 minutes on the current situation and the plans for the offensive  Model then spoke  and produced reconnaissance photos revealing some of the extensive preparations the Soviets had made in preparation for the attack  A number of options were put forth for comment  going on the offensive immediately with the forces at hand  delaying the offensive further to await the arrival of new and better tanks  radically revising the operation or cancelling it all together  Von Manstein spoke against the offensive  but not forcefully  Albert Speer spoke of the difficulties of rebuilding the armoured formations and the limitations of German industry to replace losses  Guderian argued strongly against the operation  stating  the attack was pointless   The conference ended without Hitler coming to a decision  but Citadel was not aborted  Three days later OKW  Oberkommando der Wehrmacht   Hitler s conduit for controlling the military  postponed the launch date for Citadel to 12 June   Following this meeting  Guderian continued to voice his concerns over an operation that would likely degrade the panzer forces that he had been attempting to rebuild  He believed that the offensive  as planned  was a misuse of the panzer forces  as it violated two of the three tenets he had laid out as the essential elements for a successful panzer attack  In Guderian s opinion  the limited German resources in men and materiel should be conserved as they would be needed for the pending defence of Western Europe  In a meeting with Hitler  on 10 May  he asked   Is it really necessary to attack Kursk  and indeed in the east this year at all  Do you think anyone even knows where Kursk is  The entire world doesn t care if we capture Kursk or not  What is the reason that is forcing us to attack this year on Kursk  or even more  on the Eastern Front   Hitler replied   I know  The thought of it turns my stomach   Guderian concluded   In that case your reaction to the problem is the correct one  Leave it alone    Despite reservations  Hitler remained committed to the offensive  He and OKW  early in the preparatory phase  were hopeful that the offensive would revitalize German strategic fortunes in the east  As the challenges offered by Citadel increased  he focused more and more on the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory  principally the Panther tank  but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank  He postponed the operation  to await their arrival  Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area  Hitler delayed the offensive again to allow for more equipment to reach the front  With pessimism for Citadel increasing with each delay  in June  Alfred Jodl  the Chief of Staff at OKW  instructed the armed forces propaganda office to portray the operation as a limited counteroffensive when the offensive finally did get underway  Due to concerns of an Allied landing in the south of France or Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks  Hitler postponed again  this time to 20 June  On 17–18 June  following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive  Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July  Finally on 1 July  Hitler announced that 5 July would be the launch date of the offensive  As the Soviets waited and the Germans attempted to build up their forces  a three month quiet period descended upon the Eastern Front  The Germans used this period for specialized training of their assault troops  All units did unit training and combat rehearsals  The Waffen SS had built a full scale duplicate Soviet strong point that was used to practice the techniques for neutralizing such positions  During the lull  the panzer divisions continued to try to replace equipment shortfalls and get up to strength  The total German forces to be used in the offensive included 12 panzer divisions and 5 panzergrenadier divisions  four of which could boast tank strengths greater than their neighboring panzer divisions  However  the force was markedly deficient in infantry divisions  which were essential to hold ground and secure the flanks  By the time the Germans initiated the offensive  their force amounted to around 777 000 men  2 451 tanks and assault guns  70 per cent of the German armour on the Eastern Front   and 7 417 guns and mortars   1 2  Soviet plans and preparation  In 1943  an offensive by the Soviet Central  Bryansk  and Western Fronts against Army Group Centre was abandoned shortly after it began in early March  when the southern flank of the Central Front was threatened by Army Group South  Soviet intelligence received information about German troop concentrations spotted at Orel and Kharkov  as well as details of an intended German offensive in the Kursk sector through the Lucy spy ring in Switzerland  The Soviets verified the intelligence via their spy in Britain  John Cairncross at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park  who clandestinely forwarded raw decrypts directly to Moscow  Anastas Mikoyan wrote that  on 27 March 1943  he was notified by Joseph Stalin about a possible German attack in the Kursk sector  Stalin and some senior officers were eager to strike first once the rasputitsa ended  but a number of key officers  including Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov  recommended a strategic defensive before going on the offensive  In a letter to Stavka and Stalin  on 8 April  Zhukov wrote   Stalin consulted with his front line commanders and senior officers of the General Staff  from 12 to 15 April 1943  In the end he and Stavka agreed that Kursk was the likely German target  Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative  but Zhukov countered that the Germans would be drawn into a trap where their armoured power would be destroyed  thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet offensive  They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings  before launching their own offensive  Preparation of defences and fortifications began by the end of April  and continued until the German attack in early July  The two month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and its implementation allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare   The Voronezh Front  commanded by Nikolai Vatutin  was tasked with defending the southern face of the salient  The Central Front  commanded by Konstantin Rokossovsky  defended the northern face  Waiting in reserve was the Steppe Front  commanded by Ivan Konev  In February 1943  the Central Front had been reconstructed from the Don Front  which had been part of the northern pincer of Operation Uranus and had been responsible for the destruction of the 6th Army at Stalingrad   The Central and Voronezh Fronts each constructed three main defensive belts in their sectors  with each subdivided into several zones of fortification  The Soviets availed themselves of the labour of over 300 000 civilians  Fortifying each echelon was an interconnected web of minefields  barbed wire fences  anti tank ditches  deep entrenchments for infantry  anti tank obstacles  dug in armoured vehicles  and machine gun bunkers  Behind the three main defensive belts were three more belts prepared as fallback positions  the first was not fully occupied or heavily fortified  and the last two  though sufficiently fortified  were mostly not occupied  The combined depth of the three main defensive zones was about   The six defensive belts on either side of Kursk were deep  If the Germans managed to break through these defences they would still be confronted by additional defensive belts to the east  manned by the Steppe Front  These brought the total depth of the defences to nearly    Red Army combat engineers laid 503 663 anti tank mines and 439 348 anti personnel mines  with the highest concentration in the first main defensive belt  More than of trenches were dug  laid out in criss cross pattern for ease of movement  The minefields at Kursk achieved densities of 1 700 anti personnel and 1 500 anti tank mines per kilometre  about four times the density used in the defence of Moscow  For example  the 6th Guards Army  of the Voronezh Front  was spread out over nearly of front and was protected by 69 688 anti tank and 64 430 anti personnel mines in its first defensive belt with a further 20 200 anti tank and 9 097 anti personnel mines in its second defensive belt  Furthermore  mobile obstacle detachments were tasked with laying more mines directly in the path of advancing armoured formations  These units  consisting of two platoons of combat engineers with mines at division level and one company of combat engineers normally equipped with 500–700 mines at corps level  functioned as anti tank reserves at every level of command   In his letter of 8 April  Zhukov warned that the Germans would attack the salient with a strong armoured force   Nearly all artillery  including howitzers  guns  anti aircraft and rockets  were tasked with anti tank defence  Dug in tanks and self propelled guns further strengthened the anti tank defences  Anti tank forces were incorporated into every level of command  mostly as anti tank strong points with the majority concentrated on likely attack routes and the remainder amply spread out elsewhere  Each anti tank strong point typically consisted of four to six anti tank guns  six to nine anti tank rifles  and five to seven heavy and light machine guns  They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments as well as infantry with automatic weapons  Independent tank and self propelled gun brigades and regiments were tasked with cooperating with the infantry during counterattacks   Soviet preparations included increased activity of partisans  who attacked German communications and supply lines  The attacks were mostly behind Army Group North and Army Group Centre  During June 1943  partisans operating in the occupied area behind Army Group Centre destroyed 298 locomotives  1 222 rail wagons  and 44 bridges  and in the Kursk sector there were 1 092 partisan attacks against railways  These attacks delayed the build up of German supplies and equipment  and required German troops to be diverted to suppress the partisans  delaying their training for the offensive  Many of these attacks were coordinated through the Central Partisan Headquarters  In June Soviet Air Forces flew over 800 sorties at night to resupply the partisan groups operating behind Army Group Center  The VVS also provided communication and sometimes even daylight air support for major partisan undertakings   Special training was provided to the infantry manning the defences to help them overcome the tank phobia that had been evident since the German invasion  Soldiers were packed into trenches and tanks were driven overhead until all signs of fear were gone  The soldiers were also promised financial rewards for each tank destroyed  with the People s Commisariat of Defense providing 1 000 rubles for destroyed tanks  In combat  the soldiers would spring up in the midst of the attacking infantry to separate them from the spearheading armoured vehicles  The separated armoured vehicles could then be disabled or destroyed at point blank range  These types of attacks were mostly effective against the Ferdinand tank destroyers  which lacked machine guns as secondary armament  If the armoured vehicles could be separated from their supporting infantry they became vulnerable to infantry armed with anti tank rifles  demolition charges and Molotov cocktails   The Soviets employed maskirovka  deception techniques  to mask defensive positions and troop dispositions and to conceal the movement of men and materiel  These included camouflaging gun emplacements  constructing dummy airfields and depots  generating false radio traffic  and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German held areas  Movement of forces and supplies to and from the salient was carried out at night only  Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to blend in with the landscape  Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden  Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them was forbidden   According to a Soviet General Staff report  29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe raids on Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector  during June 1943  were against dummy airfields  The Soviet deception efforts were so successful that German estimates issued in mid June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1 500 tanks  The result was not only a vast underestimation of Soviet strength  but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions  The main tank of the Soviet tank arm was the T 34  on which the Red Army attempted to concentrate production  The Soviet tank arm also contained large numbers of the T 70 light tank  For example  the 5th Guards Tank Army roughly contained 270 T 70s and 500 T 34s  In the salient itself  the Soviets had assembled a large number of lend lease tanks  These included U S  manufactured M3 Lees and British built Churchills  Matildas and Valentines  However  the T 34 made up the bulk of the Soviet armour  Without including the deeper reserves organised under the Steppe Front  the Soviets had massed about 1 300 000 men  3 600 tanks  20 000 artillery pieces  and 2 792 aircraft to defend the salient  This amounted to 26 per cent of the total manpower of the Red Army  26 per cent of its mortars and artillery  35 per cent of its aircraft  and 46 per cent of its tanks   1 3  Contest for air superiority and air support of the ground forces  Both the Luftwaffe and the V V S   the Voyenno Vozdushnye Sily  or  Military Air Forces   were air forces designed with their primary mission being to support their respective ground forces  Though the V V S  was always much larger than the Luftwaffe  in the early part of the campaign in the Soviet Union the Luftwaffe had achieved complete air superiority and inflicted huge losses upon the Soviet Air Force  The Luftwaffe s extensive air support to the German ground forces was checked only when the advance pushed beyond the range of their most forward airfields  Resupply by air of forward panzer units had been a Luftwaffe role since the start of the war  but the demand placed upon the Luftwaffe to resupply large isolated formations during the severe winter of 1941–42 and over Stalingrad the following winter cost the Luftwaffe a great deal in equipment and pilots  These losses could not be easily replaced   By 1943  the Luftwaffe was still able to achieve local air superiority  but its strength was clearly weakening  The Luftwaffe command understood that for success to be found in Operation Citadel their support would be crucial  but their ability to project force was hampered by problems with supply shortfalls  Partisan activity  particularly behind Army Group Center  slowed the rate of re supply and cut short the Luftwaffe s ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol  oil  and lubricants  They were unable to stockpile reserves of aircraft and engines  meaning that they would be unable to replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation  Fuel was the most significant limiting factor  To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel  the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June  Despite this husbanding of resources  the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days  The changing strengths of the two opponents is underscored by operational changes made by the Luftwaffe at Kursk  Air operations in previous offensive campaigns were initiated with Luftwaffe raids conducted against opposing airfields to help achieve air superiority  By this point in the war  Soviet equipment reserves were extensive  The Luftwaffe commanders realized whatever aircraft they could destroy on the ground would be easily replaced by the Soviets within days  making such raids futile  For the Kursk battle  these missions were abandoned  In previous campaigns  medium bombers – flying from well behind the frontline – had interdicted the arrival of Soviet reinforcements  However  this kind of mission was rarely attempted during Citadel  Rather  the Luftwaffe confined its operations to the direct support of the ground forces  The Luftwaffe continued to make use of the Junkers Ju 87G Stuka  A new development to this aircraft was the Bordkanone 3 7 cm calibre cannon  one of which could be slung under each wing of the Stuka in a gun pod  Half of the Stuka groups assigned to support Citadel were equipped with such weapons  The air groups were also buttressed by the recent arrival of the Henschel Hs 129  with its 30 mm MK 103 cannon  and the ground attack   jabo   version of the Focke Wulf Fw 190   In the months preceding the battle Luftflotte Six behind Army Group Center noted marked increase in the strength of the opposing VVS formations  These Soviet air groups showed indications of better training  improved equipment and increased aggressiveness  The introduction of the Yakovlev Yak 9 and Lavochkin La 5 fighters gave the Soviet pilots near parity in equipment with the Luftwaffe  Furthermore  large numbers of ground attack aircraft  such as the Ilyushin Il 2 Shturmovik and the Pe 2  were available as well  In addition to Soviet designs  the Red Air Force contained large quantities of aircraft supplied by lend lease  Huge stockpiles of supplies and ample reserves of replacement aircraft meant the Soviets would be able to conduct an extended campaign without slackening in the intensity of their effort   2  Opposing forces  2 1  Germans  For their attack  the Germans used three armies along with a large proportion of their total tank strength on the Eastern Front  The 9th Army  of Army Group Center and based north of the bulge  contained 335 000 men  223 000 combat soldiers   In the south  the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment  Kempf   of Army Group South  had 223 907 men  149 271 combat soldiers  and 100 000 men  66 000 combat soldiers  respectively  In total  the three armies had a total strength of 778 907 men  with 438 271 being combat soldiers  Army Group South was equipped with more armoured vehicles  infantry and artillery than the 9th Army  The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment  Kempf  had 1 377 tanks and assault guns  while the 9th Army possessed 988 tanks and assault guns   The two new Panther battalions  the 51st and 52nd  and 200 tanks strong   which the offensive had been delayed for  were attached to the Großdeutschland Division in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South  Arriving just prior to the launch of the offensive  the two units had little time to perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in  This was a breach of the methods of the panzerwaffe  considered essential for the successful use of armour  Though led by experienced panzer commanders  many of the tank crews were new recruits and had little time to become familiar with their new tanks and their temperamental transmissions  let alone train together to function as a unit  The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience  In addition  the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units would have little training in radio procedures  The new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions  and proved mechanically unreliable  By the morning of 5 July  the units had lost 16 Panthers due to mechanical breakdown  leaving only 184 available for the launching of the offensive   2 2  Soviets  The Red Army used two Fronts  the equivalent of army groups  for the defence of Kursk  and created a third front behind the battle area which was held as a reserve  The Central and Voronezh Fronts fielded 12 armies  with 711 575 men  510 983 combat soldiers  and 625 591 men  446 236 combat soldiers  respectively  In reserve  the Steppe Front had an additional 573 195 men  449 133   Thus the total size of the Soviet force was 1 910 361 men  with 1 426 352 actual combat soldiers   2 3  Comparison of strength  2 3 1  Operation Citadel  2 3 2  Soviet offensive phase  2 4  Preliminary actions  Preliminary fighting started on the southern face of the salient on the evening of 4 July 1943  when German infantry launched attacks to seize high ground for artillery observation posts prior to the main assault  During these attacks  a number of Soviet command and observation posts along the first main belt of defence were captured  By 16 00  elements of the Panzergrenadier Division  Großdeutschland   3rd and 11th Panzer Divisions had seized the village of Butovo and proceeded to capture Gertsovka before midnight  At around 22 30  Vatutin ordered 600 guns  mortars  and Katyusha rocket launchers  of the Voronezh Front  to bombard the forward German positions  particularly those of the II SS Panzer Corps   To the north  at Central Front headquarters  reports of the anticipated German offensive came in  At around 02 00 5 July  Zhukov ordered his preemptive artillery bombardment to begin  The hope was to catch the German forces concentrating for the attack  but the effect of the bombardment was less than hoped for  The bombardment delayed the German formations  but failed in the goal of disrupting the German schedule or inflicting substantial losses  The Germans began their own artillery bombardment at about 05 00  This lasted 80 minutes in the northern sector and 50 minutes in the south  After the barrage  the ground forces attacked  aided by close air support provided by the Luftwaffe   During the early morning  the Red Air Force launched a large raid against German airfields  hoping to catch the Luftwaffe on the ground  This effort failed  and the Soviets suffered considerable losses  The Soviets lost 176 aircraft in the attack  The losses of the 16th Air Army were lighter than those suffered by the 2nd Air Army    compared to the 26 aircraft lost by the Luftwaffe  Though the Luftwaffe was able to gain and maintain air superiority over the southern portion of the battle  the control of the skies over the northern face was evenly contested throughout   Over the course of the offensive  the Luftwaffe s chronic shortage of fuel  lubricants and spare parts began to hamper the serviceability of their aircraft and thus limited their ability to fly sorties  In addition  the need to provide ground forces with assistance  in defeating strong points and knocking out Soviet artillery positions  meant that missions could not be flown to attack Soviet airfields to help gain air superiority  giving the much more numerous Red Air Force the opportunity to have a greater presence over the battlefield  The consequences of the greater numbers of Soviet aircraft over the Luftwaffe was enhanced by the fact that by mid 1943  the Luftwaffe no longer held as great a technical superiority as it once held over its adversary   3  Operation along the northern face  Model s main attack was delivered by XLVII Panzer Corps  supported by 45 Tigers of the attached 505 Heavy Tank Battalion  Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps  with an attached regiment of 83 Ferdinand tank destroyers  On the right flank  XLVI Panzer Corps  in name only  consisted of four infantry divisions with just nine tanks and 31 assault guns  To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps  which consisted of a reinforced assault infantry division  the 78th  and two regular infantry divisions  While the corps contained no tanks  it did have 62 assault guns  Opposing the 9th Army was the Central Front  deployed in three main heavily fortified defensive belts   Model had decided not to employ his armoured force at the start of the offensive in order to prevent it from being worn out while breaking the Soviet defences  Therefore his initial attack force  tasked with breaking the first line of defence was primarily infantry  working with artillery and Luftwaffe support  Once the breakthrough had been achieved  the panzer divisions would exploit and advance towards Kursk  Jan Möschen  a major in Model s staff  later commented that Model expected a breakthrough on the second day  but that his corps commanders thought it would be extremely unlikely  Given Model s tactics  even if a breakthrough did occur the briefest delay in bringing the panzer divisions up would give the Soviets time to react and plug the gap   Following a preliminary bombardment  the 9th Army opened its attack at 05 00  Nine infantry divisions and one panzer division  with attached assault guns  heavy tanks  and tank destroyers  pushed forward  Two companies of Tiger tanks were attached to the 6th Infantry Division  and were the largest single grouping of Tigers employed that day  Facing this onslaught were the 13th and 70th Armies of the Central Front   The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry divisions  in close cooperation  spearheaded the advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps  Behind them the remaining two panzer divisions followed  ready to exploit any breakthrough  The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the attack down  By 08 00  safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield  That morning  information from the intelligence staff of the attacking divisions  obtained via prisoner interrogation  had identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment  The Tigers were redeployed  and struck towards this area  The Soviets countered this move with a force of around 90 T 34s  In the resulting three hour battle  the Soviets lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost a mere two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage  While the Soviet counter attack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached  the fighting had delayed the advancing Germans long enough for the rest of 29th Rifle Corps – behind the first line – to seal the breach and prevent a breakthrough  After a bloody engagement into the Soviet defences  the XLVII Panzer Corps attack stalled   The German attack had been along a wide front  However  due to extensive minefields and the tenacity of the Soviet defenders  the attack had stalled  Efforts by engineers to clear paths through the minefields were hampered by Soviet fire  Goliath and Borgward IV remote controlled engineer mine clearing vehicles met with limited success  Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion s 45 Ferdinands sent into battle  all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17 00  Most of these were later repaired and returned to service  but the recovery of these very large vehicles was difficult  During the first day  the Germans penetrated into the Soviet lines for the loss of 1 287 men killed and missing and a further 5 921 wounded   The following day  the Central Front launched a counterattack against the German XLVI Tank Corps  The Red Army attacked with the 2nd Tank Army and the XIX Tank Corps  The Soviet counterattack was halted by the German Tiger tanks  which knocked out 69 Soviet tanks  After the encounter with the German Tigers  Rokossovsky decided to dig in most of his remaining tanks to minimize their exposure   During the next two days  heavy fighting took place around the strong point of Ponyri  on the Orel–Kursk railway   which was one of the most heavily fortified positions in the northern sector  Both sides saw this area as a vital point  The Soviets had placed 70 anti tank guns per kilometre in this region  The German 86th and 292nd Infantry Divisions attacked Ponyri  and captured the town after intense house to house fighting on 7 July  A Soviet counterattack forced the Germans to withdraw  and a series of counterattacks ensued by both sides with control of the town being exchanged several times  By the evening of 8 July  the Germans had secured most of the town  The Ferdinands were called into action to take Hill 253 5 and succeeded on 9 July  This attack developed into a battle of attrition  with heavy casualties on both sides  The historian John Keegan called Ponyri  the new Douaumont   referencing the major battles that occurred around Fort Douamount during the First World War s Battle of Verdun   Model ordered his forces to halt to reorganize  On 9 July  a meeting was held  at the headquarters of the XLVII Panzer Corps  between von Kluge and Model  To both  it had become clear that they lacked the strength to obtain a breakthrough  but von Kluge wished to maintain the pressure on the Soviets in order to aid the southern offensive  Soviet defensive strongpoints were to be bypassed and the schwerpunkt was to shift to XLVI Panzer Corps  The 12th Panzer Division  thus far held in reserve  was to be committed  By this point  both the German and the Soviet commanders realised that the outcome of the battle had already been decided   On 10 July  the attack was renewed with air support  However  the gains made by this renewed effort were small as fresh Soviet formations had arrived to repel the German attacks  The diary of the 9th Army describes the heavy fighting as a  new type of mobile attrition battle   On 12 July  the Soviets launched Operation Kutuzov  their counter offensive upon the Orel salient  The attack threatened the flank and rear of Model s 9th Army  Two Fronts  the Bryansk Front and the Western Front  commenced the attack along the thinly held north and northeast sectors of the salient held by the 2nd Panzer Army  The Western Front assault was led by the 11th Guards Army  under Lieutenant General Hovhannes Bagramyan  and was supported by the 1st and 5th Tank Corps  The Soviet spearheads sustained heavy casualties  but pushed through and in some areas achieved significant penetrations  These penetrations threatened the German supply routes  but more importantly threatened to encircle the 9th Army and presented the chance to destroy it  With this threat  9th Army was compelled to withdraw   A review of the attack frontage and depth of the German penetration highlights the success of the Red Army defensive tactics  While Citadel began with a attack front  by 6 July it had been reduced to   The following day  this dropped to and on both the 8 and 9 July penetrations of only occurred  By 10 July  the Soviets had completely halted the German advance   4  Operation along the southern face  At around 04 00  the German attack commenced with a preliminary bombardment  Von Manstein s main attack was delivered by Hoth s 4th Panzer Army  which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads  Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army  which was composed of the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps  The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces  Though they had been provided superb intelligence  the Voronezh Front headquarters had still not been able to pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight   The panzergrenadier division Großdeutschland  commanded by Walter Hörnlein  was the strongest single division in the 4th Panzer Army  It was supported on its flanks by the 3rd and 11th Panzer Divisions  Großdeutschland s Panzer IIIs and IVs had been supplemented by a company of 15 Tigers  which were used to spearhead the attack  At dawn on 5 July  the Grossdeutschland Division  backed by heavy artillery support  advanced on a three kilometre front upon the 67th Guards Rifle Division of the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps  The Panzerfüsilier Regiment  advancing on the left wing  stalled in a minefield and subsequently 36 Panthers were immobilized  The stranded regiment was subjected to a barrage of Soviet anti tank and artillery fire  which inflicted numerous casualties  Engineers were moved up and cleared paths through the minefield  but suffered casualties in the process  With paths cleared  the regiment resumed its advance towards Gertsovka  In the ensuing battle  heavy casualties were sustained including the regimental commander Colonel Kassnitz  Due to the fighting  and the marshy terrain south of the village  surrounding the Berezovyy stream  the regiment once more bogged down  The panzergrenadier regiment of Großdeutschland  advancing on the right wing  pushed through to the village of Butovo  The tanks were deployed in a classic arrow formation to minimise the effects of the Soviet Pakfront defence  with the Tigers leading and the Panzer IIIs  IVs and assault guns fanning out to the flanks and rear  They were followed by infantry and combat engineers  Attempts by the Red Air Force to impede the advance were repulsed by the Luftwaffe   The 3rd Panzer Division  advancing on the left flank of Großdeutschland  made good progress and by the end of the day had captured Gertsovka and reached Mikhailovka  The 167th Infantry Division  on the right flank of the 11th Panzer Division  also made sufficient progress  reaching Tirechnoe by the end of the day  By the end of 5 July  a wedge had been created in the first line of the Soviet defences   4 1  II SS Panzer Corps  To the east  during the night of 4–5 July  SS combat engineers had infiltrated no man s land and cleared lanes through the Soviet minefields  At dawn  the three divisions of II SS Panzer Corps – SS Panzergrenadier Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler  2nd SS Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich and the 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf – attacked the 6th Guards Army s 52nd Guards Rifle Division  The main assault was led by a spearhead of 42 Tigers  but in total 494 tanks and assault guns attacked across a twelve kilometre front  Totenkopf  the strongest of the three divisions  advanced towards Gremuchhi and screened the right flank  The 1st SS Panzergrenadier Division advanced on the left flank towards Bykovka  The 2nd SS Panzer Division advanced between the two formations in the center  Following closely behind the tanks were the infantry and combat engineers  coming forward to demolish obstacles and clear trenches  In addition  the advance was well supported by the Luftwaffe  which greatly aided in breaking Soviet strong points and artillery positions   By 09 00 hours  the II SS Panzer Corps had advanced deep into the Soviet first line of defence along its entire front  While probing positions between the first and second Soviet defensive belts  at 1300 hours  the 2nd SS Panzer Division s vanguard came under fire from two T 34 tanks  which were quickly dispatched  40 more Soviet tanks soon engaged the division  The 1st Guards Tank Army clashed with the 2nd SS Panzer Division in a four hour battle  resulting in the Soviet tanks withdrawing  However  the battle had bought enough time for units of the 23rd Soviet Guards Rifle Corps  lodged in the Soviet second line  to prepare itself and be reinforced with additional anti tank guns  By the early evening  2nd SS Panzer Division had reached the minefields that marked the outer perimeter of the Soviet second line of defence  The 1st SS Division had secured Bykovka by 1610 hours  It then pushed forward towards the second line of defence at Yakovlevo  but its attempts to break through were rebuffed  By the end of the day  the 1st SS Division had sustained 97 dead  522 wounded  and 17 missing and lost about 30 tanks  Together with the 2nd SS Panzer Division  it had forced a wedge far into the defences of the 6th Guards Army  The 3rd SS Panzer Division was making slow progress  They had managed to isolate the 155th Guards Regiment  of the 52nd Guards Rifle Division  of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps   from the rest of its parent division  but its attempts to sweep the regiment eastward into the flank of the neighbouring 375th Rifle Division  of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps  had failed when the regiment was reinforced by the 96th Tank Brigade  Hausser  the commander of II SS Panzer Corps  requested aid from the III Panzer Corps to his east  but they were unable to assist due to facing serious challenges of its own  By the end of the day  the 3rd SS Division had made very limited progress due in part to a tributary of the Donets river  The lack of progress undermined the advance made by its sister divisions and exposed the right flank of the corps to Soviet forces   4 2  Army Detachment  Kempf   Facing Army Detachment  Kempf   consisting of III Panzer Corps and Corps  Raus   commanded by Erhard Raus   were the 7th Guards Army  dug in on the high ground on the eastern bank of the Northern Donets  The two German corps were tasked with crossing the Northern Donets  smashing through the 7th Guards Army and support the right flank of the 4th Panzer Army  The 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion – equipped with 45 Tigers – was also attached to the III Panzer Corps  split up so that one company of 15 Tigers was attached to each of the three panzer divisions of the corps  Although the river was bridged during the night of 4 July  the crossing points were targeted by Soviet artillery during the preemptive bombardment   At the Milkhailovka bridgehead  just south of Belgorod  eight infantry battalions of the 6th Panzer Division  of the III Panzer Corps  assembled there and were subjected to heavy artillery fire during the Soviet preliminary bombardment  Eventually  most of the infantry got across to the eastern bank  When a company of the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion began to cross  it too was targeted by Soviet artillery and the bridge was destroyed  Although some of the tanks managed to get across  the rest of the 6th Panzer Division had to be redeployed southward to another crossing  Clemens Graf Kageneck  battalion commander  described it thus   With the need to redeploy the 6th Panzer Division  it became clear that the division was falling behind schedule  The predicament was further aggravated when it was reported to Walther von Hünersdorff  the division s commander  that the designated crossing was already clogged with traffic  Failing to find another crossing  the remaining elements of the division remained on the western bank of the river throughout the day  Meanwhile  those units of the division that had succeeded in getting across the river launched an attack led by Tigers on Stary Gorod  However  the attack stalled due to poorly cleared minefields and strong resistance   To the south of the 6th Panzer Division  the 19th Panzer Division successfully crossed the river  but was delayed by mines that damaged some of the Tigers spearheading the advance  The division advanced eight kilometres by the end of the day  Further south  infantry and tanks of 7th Panzer Division managed to cross the bridges  The Tigers  supporting the 7th  were unable to cross due to their weight  Attempts were made to drive the Tigers across the river to relieve the infantry and tanks of the 7th  as both were under heavy attack  However  the effort was unsuccessful due to their weight and the massive Soviet artillery bombardment  Eventually  engineers constructed bridges strong enough to take the Tigers across  where they relieved their beleaguered comrades  Despite a poor start  the 7th Panzer Division eventually broke into the first line of the Soviet defence and pushed on between Razumnoe and Krutoi Log  advancing about during the day  This effort was the furthest advance achieved by Army Detachment  Kempf  during the day   Operating to the south of 7th Panzer Division  were the two infantry divisions – 106th and 320th Infantry Divisions – of Corps  Raus   The two formations  without armour support  advanced across a 32 kilometre front and made little progress  The advance began well  with the successful crossing of the river and a swift advance against the 72nd Guards Rifle Division  The Soviet defenders were taken by surprise with the speed of the advance  Erhard Raus  later wrote   After a fierce battle  involving some hand to hand fighting  Corps  Raus  took the village of Maslovo Pristani punching a hole in the first Soviet line of defence  However  the lodgement was nearly lost during a Soviet counterattack supported by about 40 tanks  The counterattack was eventually rebuffed with the assistance of artillery and flak batteries  However  having suffered 2 000 casualties since the morning and still facing considerable resistance  the corps could penetrate no further and therefore dug in for the night   4 3  First day summary  By the end of the first day Army Group South s attack had penetrated the first Soviet defensive line  II SS Panzer Corps had broken through the first line of defence by 09 00 and were pushing to breach the second  Some though  particularly the divisions of Army Detachment Kempf  had barely breached the first line  Along the entire southern face of the salient  the German thrust had been slowed  allowing the Soviets time to prepare their second line of defence to meet the German attack on 6 July  The 7th Guards Army  which had soaked up the attack of III Panzer Corps and Corps  Raus   was reinforced with two rifle divisions from the reserve  The 15th Guards Rifle Division was also moved up to the second line of defence  right in the path of III Panzer Corps  The 6th Guards Army  which had absorbed the attack by XLVIII Panzer Corps and II SS Panzer Corps  was reinforced with tanks from the 1st Tank Army  along with reinforcements from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 5th Guards Tank Corps  The 51st and 90th Guards Rifle Divisions were moved up to the vicinity of Pokrovka  not to be confused with Prokhorovka 40 kilometres to its northeast   right in the path of the 1st SS Panzer Division  Behind them  the 93rd Guards Rifle Division was deployed along the road leading from Pokrovka to Prokhorovka   4 4  The battle progresses  The steady progress of the Germans forced the Soviet leaders to commit some of their strategic reserves  as nearly all operational reserves were in action  As early as 6 July  Stavka decided to send the 2nd and 10th Tank Corps and the 5th Guards Tank Army to the southern sector  A day later  other formations were ordered to the front  Vatutin planned an operational counterstrike against the German units  but decided to cancel learning of the failure of the northern counterattack  Over Zhukov s objection  Vatutin ordered tanks to be dug in   German officers reported being slowed by the  silent tanks  – tanks dug into fortified emplacements  Not all the Soviet tanks were dug in  and a number of Soviet units launched counterattacks  On 7 July  SS Unterscharführer Franz Staudegger  commanding a Tiger tank  encountered a group of 50 T 34s  In the ensuing battle  Staudegger knocked out 22 T 34s  For his actions  he was awarded the Knight s Cross  the first Tiger commander to be awarded such a medal    Though the German advance in the south was slower than desired  it was much faster than the Soviets expected  On 9 July  the first German units reached the Psel River  The next day  the first German infantry crossed the river  Despite the deep defensive system and minefields  German tank losses were low  At this point  Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps from a northward heading directed toward Oboyan to a northeast heading towards Prokhorovka  The main concern of von Manstein and Hauser was the inability of Army Detachment  Kempf  to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps  On 11 July  Army Detachment  Kempf  finally achieved a breakthrough  In a surprise night attack  the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets  Once across  Breith made every effort to push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south  A linkup with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled  It appeared the hoped for breakthrough was at hand   4 5  Battle of Prokhorovka  Hausser had expected to continue his advance on Prokhorovka  and late on the evening of 11 July issued orders for a classic maneuver battle for the attack the next day  The attack would begin north of the Psel river  with the 3rd SS Panzer Division driving northeast until reaching the Karteschewka Prokhorovka road  Once there  they were to strike southeast to attack the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka from the rear  1st and 2nd SS Panzer divisions were to wait until Totenkopf s attack had destabilized the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka  Once the Soviets at Prokhorovka were under attack from the rear  the Leibstandarte was to join the attack  advancing through the main Soviet defenses on the west slope before Prokhorovka  To Leibstandarte s right  the 2nd SS was to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka  then turn south to roll up the Soviet line and open a gap  Unbeknownst to Hausser  Rotmistrov had moved his 5th Guards Tank Army up to an assembly area just below Prokhorovka  on the night of 11 12 July  in preparation for a massive attack the following day  Throughout the night  German frontline troops could hear the ominous sounds of Soviet tank engines to the east as the 18th and 29th Tank Corps moved into their assembly areas   At 06 15  a Soviet artillery barrage began  At 06 30  Rotmistrov radioed his tankers   Steel  Steel  Steel    the order to commence the attack  Down off the west slopes  before Prokhorovka  came the massed armour of five tank brigades from the two Soviet tank corps  They had been ordered to approach at high speed  Rotmistrov  fearing that German Tiger tanks made up a large component of his opponents forces  had instructed his tankers to move forward at speed to close the range quickly  firing on the move in an attempt to obtain a flank or rear firing position on the German tanks  During this time period  firing on the move was highly inaccurate  particularly while moving at high speed  Soviet intelligence estimates fixed the number of German Tiger tanks  in the Prokhorovka area  at approximately 100  In actuality  the II SS Panzer Corps had only 15 Tiger tanks  Ten of these tanks were north of the Psel River with the 3rd SS  the 1st SS had four operational Tiger tanks  and the 2nd SS had only one  The 1st SS had just started to advance  when it was taken largely by surprise  As the Soviet tanks aggressively advanced down the corridor  they carried the 9th Parachute Division into battle mounted on the tanks with the paratroopers holding onto rails  At the base of Hill 252 2 was a Soviet dug anti tank ditch  With the firing of purple warning flares across the entire front  Rudolf von Ribbentrop  a company commander  stated he knew at once that a major attack was at hand  He ordered his company s seven remaining Panzer IVs to start up and follow him  over a bridge that had been constructed over an anti tank ditch  onto the lower slope of Hill 252 2  On the crest of the hill  above him  was Joachim Peiper s 2nd SS Panzergrenadiers  supported by their halftracks  who were being overrun  As Ribbentrop s tanks fanned out on the lower slope  he looked up to the crest of the hillside  He recalled   In front of me appeared fifteen  then twenty  then thirty  then forty tanks  Finally there were too many of them to count  The T 34s were rolling toward us at speed  and carrying mounted infantry   The Soviet tanks charged down the west slope of the hill  firing as they moved  Amid the swirls of dust  a highly confused tank battle began  The Panzer IV  to Ribbentrop s right  was set ablaze  The company was soon swamped by the large numbers of Soviet tanks advancing down the hill  At the base of the hill  the advancing Soviet armour was held up by the anti tank ditch  Heavy firing commenced between the Soviet armour and tanks of the 1st SS based on the opposite side of the ditch  Meanwhile  the Soviet tanks searched for a route across the ditch  On the hilltop  with the passage of the first waves of Soviet tanks  Peiper s surviving panzergrenadiers emerged from trench lines to engage the Soviet paratroopers and attack Soviet tanks with magnetic shaped charges  Twenty of the battalion s half tracks were lost in the fighting  some destroyed when they attempted to ram the much heavier Soviet tanks in an effort to stop them from destroying the company   To the north and east  the 3rd SS was engaged by the Soviet 33rd Guards Rifle Corps  Tasked with destabilizing the Soviet defenses before Prokhorovka  the unit first had to beat off a number of attacks before they could go over onto the offensive  Most of the division s tank losses occurred late in the afternoon as they advanced through mine fields against well hidden Soviet anti tank guns  Although the 3rd SS succeeded in reaching the Karteschewka Prokhorovka road  their hold was tenuous and it cost the division half of its armour  The majority of German tank losses suffered at Prokhorovka occurred here  To the south  the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps  of the 5th Guards Tank Army  had been thrown back by the 1st SS acting alone  Meanwhile  the 2nd SS was holding a line to the south against the 2nd Tank Corps and the 2nd Guards Tank Corps   The Soviet attacks had been checked by the II SS Panzer Corps  without the Germans losing any ground  By early afternoon  it was clear that Rotmistrov s attack had failed  Luftwaffe air superiority  over the battlefield  also contributed to the Soviet losses  partly due to the VVS being directed against the units flanking II SS Panzer Corps  Hs 129s and Ju 87s inflicted significant losses on the 5th Guards Tank Army  Soviet tank losses were extremely heavy  A report from the 29th Tank Corps reported  heavy losses in tanks through enemy aircraft and artillery  attacks   and commented that  due to continuous air attacks  they were unable to advance further and shifted to the defence   By the end of the day  the Soviets had fallen back to their starting positions   The battle is considered a tactical defeat for the Red Army due to the heavy tank losses  but operationally the battle was a draw  Neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives  Though the Soviet counterattack failed and they were thrown back onto the defensive  they did enough to stop a German breakthrough  Tank losses during the battle have been a contentious subject  Red Army tank losses have been given from 200 to 822  but records show about 300 complete losses and as many damaged  The Soviets claimed enormous German losses  stating they had destroyed at least 400 tanks  including 100 Tiger tanks  and inflicting 3 500 deaths  German records indicate that their losses were minute in comparison to the Soviet claims  Three to five tanks were destroyed  and between 40 and 70 were damaged  Manpower losses were in the region of 500 killed  The 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions reported 186 tanks  assault guns  and tank hunters serviceable on the eve of battle  and 190 available the evening after   5  Allied Invasion in Sicily and Termination of Operation Citadel  On the evening of 12 July  Hitler summoned von Kluge and von Manstein to his headquarters at Rastenburg  in East Prussia  Two days prior  the Western Allies had invaded Sicily  The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive  Von Kluge welcomed the news  as he was aware that the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector  but von Manstein was less welcoming  Von Manstein s forces had just spent a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they were on the verge of breaking through to more open terrain  which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle  Von Manstein stated   On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he  has  committed  are  completely beaten   Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuence of the offensive in the south part of the salient  but the following day he ordered von Manstein s reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army  This removed the force von Manstein believed was needed to succeed   On 16 July  German forces withdrew to their start line  The following day  OKH ordered the II SS Panzer Corps to be withdrawn and transferred to Italy  The strength of the Soviet reserve formations had been greatly underestimated by German intelligence  and the Soviets soon went onto the offensive   5 1  Controversy  Following the war a number of German generals were highly critical of Hitler s decision to call off the operation at the height of the tactical battle  This criticism has received support from German officers in the post war German Army  Bundeswehr   and by a number of historians  Anticipating that the Western Allies would conduct some form of operation in Western Europe  both von Manstein and Guderian had argued prior to the battle for forces to be conserved and re deployed as a reserve  Once committed to the operation  it made little sense to pull them out at the climax  especially since they could not reach Italy in time to impact events there  Von Manstein argued that pulling forces out from Army Group South in the midst of the battle  shifting away Luftwaffe support and transferring his reserve force deprived his Army of its striking power at what he believed was the decisive point of the battle  The accuracy of Manstein s assertion is debatable  The extent of Soviet reserves was far greater than von Manstein realized  These reserves were used to re equip the mauled 5th Guards Tank Army  which launched Operation Rumyantsev a couple of weeks later  However  rebuilding this formation did take time  The essential thing was to concentrate the available force for a decisive action  Hitler s unwillingness to accept risk resulted in his commanders being unable to concentrate  Further  he restricted them from fighting the type of mobile battle they wanted  despite von Manstein s success in this type of action only a few months before at the Third Battle of Kharkov  The result was a battle of attrition they were ill prepared for and which they had little chance of winning   6  Soviet counteroffensives  6 1  In the north  Operation Kutuzov  Soviet offensive operations for the summer of 1943 were planned to begin after the strength of the German forces had been dissipated by their Kursk offensive  As the German momentum in the north slowed the Soviets launched Operation Kutusov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient  north of Kursk  The Bryansk Front  under the command of Markian Popov  attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front  commanded by Vasily Sokolovsky  attacked from the north  The thinly stretched 2nd Panzer Army stood in the way of this Soviet force  The German commanders had been wary of such an attack and forces were quickly withdrawn from the Kursk offensive to meet the Soviet offensive   Operation Kutuzov reduced the Orel salient and inflicted substantial losses on the German military  paving the way for the liberation of Smolensk  Soviet losses were heavy  but were replaced  The offensive allowed the Soviets to seize the strategic initiative  which they retained for the remainder of the war   6 2  In the south  Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev  Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was intended as the main Soviet offensive for 1943  Its aim was to degrade the 4th Panzer Army and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South  After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front  during Operation Citadel  the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit  delaying the start of the offensive until 3 August  Diversionary attacks  launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donets Basin  drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow  The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South  They drove through the German positions  making broad and deep penetrations  By 5 August  the Soviets had liberated Belgorod  By 12 August  the outskirts of Kharkov had been reached  The Soviet advance was finally halted by a counter attack by the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions  In the ensuing tank battles  the Soviet armies suffered heavy losses in armour  After this setback  the Soviets focused on Kharkov  After heavy fighting the city was liberated on 23 August  This battle is referred to by the Germans as the Fourth Battle of Kharkov  while the Soviets refer to it as the Belgorod–Kharkov offensive operation   7  Results  The campaign was a decisive Soviet success  For the first time  a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough  The Germans  despite using more technologically advanced armour than in previous years  were unable to break through the in depth Soviet defences and were surprised by the significant operational reserves of the Red Army  This was an outcome that few had predicted  This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front  The Soviet victory had not come cheap  The Red Army  although preventing the Germans from achieving their goals  lost considerably more men and material  However  the Soviet Union had more industrial potential and a larger pool of manpower to draw from giving them the ability to eventually fully recover   With victory  the initiative firmly passed to the Red Army  For the remainder of the war the Germans were limited to reacting to Soviet advances  and were never able to regain the initiative or launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front  The Western Allied landings  in Italy  opened up a new front  further diverting German resources and attention   Though the location  plan of attack  and timing were determined by Hitler  he blamed the defeat on his General Staff  Unlike Stalin  who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions  Hitler s interference in German military matters progressively increased while his attention to the political aspects of the war decreased  The opposite was true for Stalin  Throughout the Kursk campaign he trusted the judgment of his commanders  and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment  Stalin stepped back from operational planning  only rarely overruling military decisions  resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action during the course of the war   8  Casualties and losses  The casualties suffered by the two combatants are difficult to determine  due to several factors  In regard to the Germans  equipment losses were complicated by the fact that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks  For example  tanks disabled one day often appeared a day or two later repaired  German personnel losses are clouded by the lack of access to German unit records  which were seized at the end of the war  Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978  while others were taken by the Soviet Union  which declined to confirm their existence   8 1  Soviet losses  Grigoriy Krivosheyev  who based his figures on the Soviet archives  is considered by historian David Glantz as the most reliable source for Soviet casualty figures  His figures are supported by Karl Heinz Frieser  Krivosheyev calculated total Soviet losses during the German offensive of at 177 877 casualties  The Central Front suffered 15 336 irrecoverable casualties and 18 561 medical casualties  for a total of 33 897 casualties  The Voronezh Front suffered 27 542 irrecoverable casualties and 46 350 medical casualties  for a total of 73 892  The Steppe Front suffered 27 452 irrecoverable casualties and 42 606 medical casualties  for a total of 70 085   During the two Soviet offensives  total casualties amounted to 685 456 men  During Operation Kutuzov  Soviet losses amounted to 112 529 irrecoverable casualties and 317 361 medical casualties  for a total loss of 429 890 men  The Western Front reported 25 585 irrecoverable casualties and 76 856 medical casualties  The Bryansk Front suffered 39 173 irrecoverable casualties and 123 234 medical casualties  The Central Front lost 47 771 irrecoverable casualties and 117 271 medical casualties  Soviet losses during Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev totaled 255 566 men  with 71 611 listed as irrecoverable casualties and 183 955 as medical casualties  The Voronezh Front lost 48 339 irrecoverable casualties and 108 954 medical casualties  for a total of 157 293  The Steppe Front lost 23 272 irrecoverable casualties and 75 001 medical casualties  for a total of 98 273   Soviet equipment losses during the German offensive came to 1 614 tanks and self propelled guns destroyed or damaged of the 3 925 vehicles committed to the battle  The Soviet losses were roughly three times larger than the German losses  During Operation Kutuzov  2 349 tanks and self propelled guns were lost out of an initial strength of 2 308  a loss of over 100 percent  During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1 864 tanks and self propelled guns were lost out of the 2 439 employed  The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5 1 in favour of the German military  However  large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength  The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks  many of Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to keep them in the fight  Soviet tank strength went back up to 2 750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles  According to Christer Bergström  Red Air Force losses  during the German offensive  amounted to 677 aircraft on the northern flank and 439 on the southern flank  Total casualties are uncertain  Bergström s research indicates total Soviet air losses between 12 July and 18 August  during the German offensive and the Operation Kutuzov counteroffensive  were 1 104   8 2  German losses  Karl Heinz Frieser  who reviewed the German archive record  calculated that during Operation Citadel 54 182 casualties were suffered  Of these  9 036 were killed  1 960 were reported missing  and 43 159 were wounded  The 9th Army suffered 23 345 casualties  while Army Group South suffered 30 837 casualties  Throughout the Soviet offensives  86 064 casualties were suffered  In facing Operation Kutuzov  14 215 men were killed  11 300 were reported missing  presumed killed or captured   and 60 549 were wounded  During Polkovodets Rumyantsev  25 068 casualties were incurred  including 8 933 killed and missing  Total casualties for the three battles were about 170 000 men   During Operation Citadel  252 to 323 tanks and assault guns were destroyed  By 5 July  when the Battle of Kursk started  there were only 184 operational Panthers  Within two days  this had dropped to 40  On 17 July 1943 after Hitler had ordered a stop to the German offensive  Gen  Heinz Guderian sent in the following preliminary assessment of the Panthers   By 16 July  Army Group South submitted 161 tanks and 14 assault guns had been lost as total writeoffs  Up to 14 July  9th Army reported they had lost as total writeoffs 41 tanks and 17 assault guns  These losses break down as 109 Panzer IVs  42 Panthers  38 Panzer IIIs  31 assault guns  19 Elefants  10 Tigers  and three flame tanks  Before the Germans ended their offensive at Kursk  the Soviets began their counteroffensive  and succeeded in pushing the Germans back into a steady retreat  Thus  a report on 11 August 1943 showed that the numbers of total writeoffs in Panthers swelled to 156  with only 9 operational  The German Army was forced into a fighting retreat and increasingly lost tanks in combat as well as from abandoning and destroying damaged vehicles  Across the entire Eastern Front 50 Tiger tanks were lost during July and August  with some 240 damaged  Most of these occurred during their offensive at Kursk Some 600 tanks sustained damage in the period from 5 July 18 July   The total number of German tanks and assault guns destroyed during July and August along the entire Eastern Front amount to 1 331  Of these  Frieser estimates that 760 were destroyed during the Battle of Kursk   Frieser reports Luftwaffe losses at 524 planes  with 159 lost during the German offensive  218 destroyed during Operation Kutuzov  and a further 147 lost during Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev  In reviewing the reports of the quartermaster of the Luftwaffe  Christer Bergström presents different figures  Between 5 and 31 July  Bergström reports 681 aircraft lost or damaged  335 for Fliegerkorps VIII and 346 for Luftflotte 6  with a total of 420 being written off  192 from Fliegerkorps VIII and 229 from Luftflotte 6    9  Analysis of Citadel  9 1  Analysis of northern assault  A number of factors explain the 9th Army s lack of progress  a lack of concentration of force  and the Soviet defensive planning  German armour was committed piecemeal  rather than in strength  and often without sufficient infantry support  Marshal Rokossovsky s Central Front had correctly anticipated the likely areas of German attack  and heavily fortified those areas  The Soviet 13th Army  which bore the brunt of the German attack  was far stronger in men and anti tank guns than the other Central Front units and held the strongest defensive positions in the salient   Model s decision not to use his panzer divisions as a concentrated force  is seen as the most significant reason for the lack of progress  His army lacked the tank strength of von Manstein  and Model was well aware that the Soviets were preparing for an attack to the north  As a result  he placed his most powerful corps  Gruppe  Esebeck   comprising the 2nd Panzer Division and 10th Panzer Grenadier Division   in a reserve position behind the front to use as a  fire brigade  against any Soviet attacks upon his flank   9 2  Analysis of southern assault  Red Army minefields and artillery were successful in delaying the German attack and inflicting losses  The ability of dug in Red Army units to delay the Germans allowed their own reserves to be brought up into threatened sectors  Over 90 000 additional mines were laid during the operations  by small mobile groups of engineers  generally working at night immediately in front of the expected German attack areas  There were no large scale captures of prisoners nor any great loss of artillery  indicating that Soviet units were giving ground in good order   9 3  Military historian opinions  Karl Heinz Frieser highlights the following reasons for the failure of Operation Citadel   The Soviets held numerical superiority  However  he argues the Red Army s superiority in tank strength had little influence on the outcome of the battle  Furthermore  the Germans had a shortage of infantry and lacked operational reserves  In comparison  the Red Army were able to field the Steppe Front as a reserve   Senior officers  such as von Manstein and Zeitzler  had pushed for a fast attack to catch the Red Army unprepared and to take advantage of their low morale following the Third Battle of Kharkov  However  Hitler s repeated delays allowed the Red Army enough time to turn the bulge  around Kursk  into an enormous fortress  Finally  he argues that Hitler s date for the attack was the  most adverse possible  as it coincided with the Western Allied invasion of Sicily  David Glantz draws the following conclusions   The German defeat at Kursk did not come about by the  often exaggerated numerical superiority  of the Soviet armed forces  and asserts the tank strength was almost even  between 1 1 and 1 5 1 in the Soviets  favour  He argues the principal factor was the revolution in Soviet command  staff  operational  and tactical techniques  The General Staff had learned lessons from previous battles and disseminated  war experience  based on an  exhaustive  analysis of battles  operations and campaigns  These lessons were added to the Soviet doctrine of deep battle  producing new procedures   The Soviets introduced new operational and tactical techniques  and had solved many of the problems of integrating arms and services into  a true combined arms operation   He emphasizes  sophisticated understanding of intelligence  deception  and anti tank defence   Similar improvements were made in the combined use of artillery  tanks  engineers and infantry to break German defences on a narrow front  At Prokhorovka  and during Operation Kutuzov  the Red Army gained experience with mobile armoured formations and mechanized corps that became the hallmark of future Soviet operations  These formations demonstrated their ability to match the best efforts of the German tank force  Operations still needed to be perfected to reduce huge casualties  Nevertheless  the German command recognized that at Kursk they faced an entirely new and more competent Red Army than in earlier battles   Defensive tactics had improved  Skilful use of anti tank artillery  in strong points  and the use of separate tank and self propelled gun units to support them offered mobile defence support  These units participated in wearing down German tactical attacks   Steven Zaloga offers the following insights about the Red Army at Kursk   The popular perception of Soviet victory  by numbers  is a myth created by the German generals when writing their memoirs  He rejects the caricature of the Red Army relying on mass  rather than tactical skill  but accepts that at the tactical level the Red Army was not particularly impressive and received significantly poorer training  He comments that there were still many tactical lessons to be learned  but by 1943 the gap between Soviet and German tank crew training had  narrowed greatly  and the Soviets were soon at a comparable level with the Germans   The Soviets  in terms of operational art  were adept at using mobile tank formations  He asserts that Soviet operational methods were superior  allowing Soviet field commanders to bluff  baffle and overwhelm their opponents  Richard Overy makes the following observations   The quality of the two air forces were even  The Soviets had introduced air to ground communications  radar  a proper maintenance system  and depots for forward fuel reserves  This allowed aircraft to fly twenty missions in the heat of the battle  while the Luftwaffe suffered shortages   The Soviet tanks were not inferior in quality  Although the T 34 was out ranged by the German Tiger and Panthers  it was faster  more manoeuvrable  and more mechanically reliable than its German counterparts  To counter the Tiger tank  Soviets crews were ordered to close the distance so that range would not become an issue  According to Glantz and House  the Soviet tanks pressed home their initial attacks despite significant German advantages  Sir Harry Hinsley  who worked at Bletchley Park during the war and is a professional historian  has noted the following   Information decrypted by Ultra was given to the Soviets  which helped them prepare for the offensive  The Soviets had a spy at Bletchley Park  John Cairncross   who gave them decrypts of German military communications  Hinsley speculates that without Ultra  Germany would have won at Kursk  and  Hitler could have carved up Russia    10  Notes  11  Citations  12  References  Battistelli  Pier Paolo ‘‘Panzer Divisions  The Eastern Front 1941–43’’ Oxford  Osprey 2008   Jacobsen  Hans Adolf and Jürgen
