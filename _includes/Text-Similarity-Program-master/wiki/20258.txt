The McIntosh  McIntosh Red  or colloquially the Mac     the same as Macintosh  is an apple cultivar  The fruit has red and green skin  a tart flavour  and tender white flesh  which ripens in late September  In the 20th century it was the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England  and is considered an all purpose apple  suitable both for cooking and eating raw  Apple Inc  employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the fruit   John McIntosh discovered the original McIntosh sapling on his Dundela farm in Upper Canada in 1811  He and his wife bred it  and the family started grafting the tree and selling the fruit in 1835  In 1870  it entered commercial production  and became common in northeastern North America after 1900  While still important in production  the fruit s popularity fell in the early 21st century in the face of competition from varieties such as the Gala  According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States   1  Description  The McIntosh or McIntosh Red  nicknamed the  Mac    is the most popular apple cultivar in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States  It also sells well in eastern Europe   A spreading tree that is moderately vigorous  the McIntosh bears annually or in alternate years  The tree is hardy to at least USDA Hardiness zone 4a  or   50% or more of its flowers die at or below   The McIntosh apple is a small  to medium sized round fruit with a short stem  It has a red and green skin that is thick  tender  and easy to peel  Its white flesh is sometime tinged with green or pink and is juicy  tender  and firm  soon becoming soft  The flesh is easily bruised   The fruit is considered  all purpose   suitable both for eating raw and for cooking  It is used primarily for dessert  and requires less time to cook than most cultivars  It is usually blended when used for juice   The fruit grows best in cool areas where nights are cold and autumn days are clear  otherwise  it suffers from poor colour and soft flesh  and tends to fall from the tree before harvest  It stores for two to three months in air  but is prone to scald  flesh softening  chilling sensitivity  and coprinus rot  It can become mealy when stored at temperatures below   The fruit is optimally stored in a controlled atmosphere in which temperatures are between   and air content is 1 5–4 5% oxygen and 1–5% carbon dioxide  under such conditions  the McIntosh will keep for five to eight months   2  Cultivation  The McIntosh is most commonly cultivated in Canada  the United States  and eastern Europe  The parentage of the McIntosh is unknown  but the Snow Apple  or Fameuse   Fall St Lawrence  and Alexander have been speculated  It is one of the top five apple cultivars used in cloning  and research indicates the McIntosh combines well for winter hardiness   If unsprayed  the McIntosh succumbs easily to apple scab  which may lead to entire crops being unmarketable  It has generally low susceptibility to fire blight  powdery mildew  cedar apple rust  quince rust  and hawthorn rust  It is susceptible to fungal diseases such as Nectria canker  brown rot  black rot  race 1 of apple rust  but resists race 2   It is moderately resistant to Pezicula bark rot and Alternaria leaf blotch  and resists brown leaf spot well   The McIntosh is one of the most common cultivars used in cloning  a 1996 study found that the McIntosh was a parent in 101 of 439 cultivars selected  more than any other founding clone  It was used in over half of the Canadian cultivars selected  and was used extensively in the United States and Eastern Europe as well  rarely was it used elsewhere  Offsprings of the McIntosh include  the Jersey Black hybrid the Macoun  the Newtown Pippin hybrid the Spartan  the Cortland  the Empire  the Jonamac  the Jersey Mac  the Lobo  the Melba  the Summered  the Empire  the Tydeman s Red  and possibly the Paula Red   3  History  Apple trees were introduced to Canada at the Habitation at Port Royal  modern Port Royal  Annapolis County  Nova Scotia  as early as 1606 by French settlers  Following its introduction  apple cultivation spread inland   The McIntosh s discoverer  John McIntosh  1777 –    left his native Mohawk Valley home in New York State in 1796 to follow his love  Dolly Irwin  who had been taken to Upper Canada by her Loyalist parents  She had died by the time he found her  but he settled as a farmer in Upper Canada  He married Hannah Doran in 1801  and they farmed along the Saint Lawrence River until 1811  when McIntosh exchanged the land he had with his brother in law Edward Doran for a plot in Dundela   While clearing the overgrown plot McIntosh discovered some wild apple seedlings on his farm  He transplanted the seedlings next to his house  One of the seedlings bore particularly good fruit  The McIntosh grandchildren dubbed the fruit it produced  Granny s apple   as they often saw their grandmother taking care of the tree in the orchard  McIntosh was selling seedlings from the tree by 1820  but they did not produce fruit of the quality of the original   John McIntosh s son Allan  1815–1899  learned grafting about 1835  with this cloning the McIntoshes could maintain the distinctive properties of the fruit of the original tree  Allan and brother Sandy  1825–1906   nicknamed  Sandy the Grafter   increased production and promotion of the cultivar  Earliest sales were in 1835  and in 1836 the cultivar was renamed the  McIntosh Red   it entered commercial production in 1870  The apple became popular after 1900  when the first sprays for apple scab were developed  A house fire damaged the original McIntosh tree in 1894  it last produced fruit in 1908  and died and fell over in 1910   Horticulturist William Tyrrell Macoun of the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa is credited with popularizing the McIntosh in Canada  He stated the McIntosh needed  no words of praise   that it was  one of the finest appearing and best dessert apples grown   The Macoun  a hybrid of the McIntosh and Jersey Black grown by the Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva  NY  was named for him in 1923  In the northeastern United States the McIntosh replaced a large number of Baldwins that were killed in a severe winter in 1933–34  In the late 1940s  Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Andrew McNaughton told Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko that the McIntosh Red was Canada s best apple   The McIntosh made up 40% of the Canadian apple market by the 1960s  and at least thirty varieties of McIntosh hybrid were known by 1970  Its popularity later waned in the face of competition from foreign imports  in the first decade of the 21st century  the Gala accounted for 33% of the apple market in Ontario to the McIntosh s 12%  and the Northern Spy had become the preferred apple for pies  Production remained important to Ontario  however  as of McIntoshes were produced in 2010   The original tree discovered by John McIntosh bore fruit for more than ninety years  and died in 1910  Horticulturalists from the Upper Canada Village heritage park saved cuttings from the last known first generation McIntosh graft before it died in 2011 for producing clones   4  Cultural significance  A popular subscription funded a plaque placed from the original McIntosh tree in 1912  The Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board replaced the plaque with a more descriptive one in 1962  and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada put up another in a park nearby in 2001  by a painted mural commemorating the fruit   Apple Inc  employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the McIntosh  He deliberately misspelled the name to avoid conflict with the hi fi equipment manufacturer McIntosh Laboratory  Apple s attempt in 1982 to trademark the name Macintosh was nevertheless denied due to the phonetic similarity between Apple s product and the name of the hi fi manufacturer  Apple licensed the rights to the name in 1983  and bought the trademark in 1986   In 1995 the Royal Canadian Mint commissioned Toronto artist Roger Hill to design a commemorative silver dollar for release in 1996  Mint engraver Sheldon Beveridge engraved the image of a group of three McIntoshes and a McIntosh blossom which adorn one side with a ribbon naming the variety  An inscription on the edge reads  1796 Canada Dollar 1996   Issued sheathed in a silver cardboard sleeve in a black leatherette case  133 779 pieces of the proof were sold  as well as 58 834 pieces of the uncirculated version in a plastic capsule and silver sleeve   5  See also  Jubilee apple  Wijcik McIntosh  Spartan  apple   6  Notes
