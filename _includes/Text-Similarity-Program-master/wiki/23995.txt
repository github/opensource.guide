streamers  A birthday cake is usually served with lit candles that are to be blown out after a  birthday wish  has been made  The person being honored will be given the first piece of cake  While the birthday cake is being brought to the table  the song  Happy Birthday to You  or some other birthday song is sung by the guests   At parties for children  time is often taken for the  gift opening  wherein the individual whose birthday is celebrated opens each of the gifts brought  It is also common at children s parties for the host to give parting gifts to the attendees in the form of  goodie bags   Children and even adults sometimes wear colorful cone shaped party hats   Birthday parties are often larger and more extravagant if they celebrate someone who has reached what is regarded in

surprise party  At most such parties  the guests will arrive an hour or so before the honored person arrives  Often  a friend in on the surprise will lead the honored person to the location of the party without letting on anything   The guests might even conceal themselves from view  and when the honored person enters the room  they leap from hiding and all shout   Surprise   For some surprise birthday parties  it is considered to be a good tactic to shock the honored person  Streamers  silly string  and balloons may be used for this purpose  Evidence of a party  such as decorations and
