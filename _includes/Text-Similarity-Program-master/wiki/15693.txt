Jersey      Jèrriais  Jèrri  ʒɛri    officially the Bailiwick of Jersey    Jèrriais  Bailliage dé Jèrri   is a possession of the Crown in right of Jersey  off the coast of Normandy  France  The bailiwick consists of the island of Jersey  along with surrounding uninhabited islands and rocks collectively named Les Dirouilles  Les Écréhous  Les Minquiers  Les Pierres de Lecq  and other reefs  Jersey was part of the Duchy of Normandy  whose dukes went on to become kings of England from 1066  After Normandy was lost by the kings of England in the thirteenth century  and the ducal title surrendered to France  Jersey and the other Channel Islands remained attached to the English crown   Jersey is a self governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy  with its own financial  legal and judicial systems  and the power of self determination   The island of Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands  Although the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands  the  Channel Islands  are not a constitutional or political unit  Jersey has a separate relationship to the British Crown from the other Crown dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man  It is not part of the United Kingdom  and has an international identity separate from that of the UK but the United Kingdom is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey  The Commission have confirmed in a written reply to the European Parliament in 2003 that Jersey is within the Union as a European Territory for whose external relationships the United Kingdom is responsible  Jersey is not fully part of the European Union but has a special relationship with it  notably being treated as within the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods   1  Toponymy  1 1  Origin of the name  The Channel Islands are mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as the following  Sarnia  Caesarea  Barsa  Silia and Andium  but Jersey cannot be identified specifically because none corresponds directly to the present names  The name Caesarea has been used as the Latin name for Jersey  also in its French version Césarée  since William Camden s Britannia  and is used in titles of associations and institutions today  The Latin name Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea   Andium  Agna and Augia were used in antiquity   Scholars variously surmise that Jersey and Jèrri derive from jarð  Old Norse for  earth   or jarl  earl   or perhaps a personal name  Geirr   Geirr s Island    The ending  ey denotes an island  as in Guernsey or Surtsey    2  History  Jersey history is influenced by its strategic location between the northern coast of France and the southern coast of England  the island s recorded history extends over a thousand years   La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site inhabited before rising sea levels transformed Jersey into an island  Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity  as demonstrated by the concentration of dolmens  Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island  In June 2012 it was announced that two metal detectorists had uncovered in Grouville what could be Europe s largest hoard of Iron Age coins  which may be worth up to £10 M  after a search spanning 30 years  It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50 000 Roman and Celtic coins  This came after an earlier find of 60 Iron Age coins  in the same area  by the same men   Further archaeological evidence of Roman influence has been found  in particular the coastal headland site at Le Pinacle  Les Landes  where remains of a primitive structure are attributed to Gallo Roman temple worship  fanum   Evidence for settled Roman occupation has yet to be established   Jersey was part of Neustria with the same Gallo Frankish population as the continental mainland  Jersey  the whole Channel Islands and the Cotentin peninsula  probably with the Avranchin  came formerly under the control of the duke of Brittany during the Viking invasions  because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them  however they remained in the archbishopric of Rouen  Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the ninth century  and was eventually annexed to the future Duchy of Normandy  together with the other Channel Islands  Cotentin and Avranchin  by William Longsword  count of Rouen in 933 and it became one of the Norman Islands  When William s descendant  William the Conqueror  conquered England in 1066  the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch  The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island  and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman French Jersey family names  King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II Augustus  but retained possession of Jersey and the other Channel Islands  In 1259  the English king formally surrendered his claim to the duchy and ducal title  and since then the islands have been internally self governing territories of the English British crown   Islanders travelled across the North Atlantic to participate in the Newfoundland fisheries in the late 16th century  In recognition for help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s  Charles II gave George Carteret  bailiff and governor  a large grant of land in the American colonies in between the Hudson and Delaware rivers which he promptly named New Jersey  It is now a state in the United States of America   On 6 January 1781  a French invasion force of 2 000 men set out to take over the island – only half of the force arrived and landed  The battle by 9 000 men to defend the Island  although touch and go  and decisive  only lasted about half an hour  There were about thirty casualties on each side  and 600 French prisoners were taken  Both commanders were slain   Trade laid the foundations of prosperity  aided by neutrality between England and France  The Jersey way of life involved agriculture  milling  fishing  shipbuilding  and production of woollen goods  19th century improvements in transport links brought tourism to the island   During World War II  citizens were evacuated to the UK  and Jersey was occupied by Germany from 1 July 1940 until 9 May 1945  when Germany surrendered  During this time the Germans constructed many fortifications using Soviet slave labour  After 1944 supplies from mainland France were interrupted by the D Day landings and food on the island became scarce  The SS Vega was sent to the island carrying Red Cross supplies and news of the success of the Allied advance in Europe  The Channel Islands were one of the last places in Europe to be liberated   3  Politics  Jersey s unicameral legislature is the Assembly of the States of Jersey  It includes fifty one elected members  ten senators  elected on an island wide basis   twelve Connétables  often called  constables   heads of parishes  and twenty nine deputies  representing constituencies   all elected for four year terms as from the October 2011 elections  There are also five non voting members appointed by the Crown  the Bailiff  the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey  the Dean of Jersey  the Attorney General and Solicitor General  Jersey has one of the lowest voter turn outs internationally  in 2005 with just 33% of the electorate voting – putting it well below the 77% European average for that year  The government is a Council of Ministers  consisting of a Chief Minister and nine ministers  Each minister may appoint up to two assistant ministers  A Chief Executive is head of the civil service  Some government functions are carried out in the island s twelve parishes   The Bailiff is President  presiding officer  of the States Assembly  head of the judiciary and as civic head of the island carries out various ceremonial roles   As one of the Crown dependencies  Jersey is autonomous and self governing  with its own independent legal  administrative and fiscal systems  In 1973  the Royal Commission on the Constitution set out the duties of the Crown as including  ultimate responsibility for the  good government  of the Crown dependencies  ratification of island legislation by Order in Council  Royal Assent   international representation  subject to consultation with the island authorities before concluding any agreement which would apply to them  ensuring the islands meet their international obligations  and defence   Despite the popular tradition that she is Duke of Normandy  Queen Elizabeth II reigns in Jersey as Queen of the United Kingdom and her other Realms and Territories  the dukedom of Normandy was surrendered to France by the Treaty of Paris in 1259    The Crown  is defined by the Law Officers of the Crown as the  Crown in right of Jersey   The Queen s representative and adviser in the island is the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey  He is a point of contact between Jersey ministers and the United Kingdom government and carries out executive functions in relation to immigration control  deportation  naturalisation and the issue of passports  Since September 2011  the incumbent Lieutenant Governor has been General Sir John McColl   3 1  Legal system  Jersey is a distinct jurisdiction for the purposes of conflict of laws  separate from the other Channel Islands  England and Wales  Scotland and Northern Ireland   Jersey law has been influenced by several different legal traditions  in particular Norman customary law  English common law and modern French civil law  Jersey s legal system is therefore described as  mixed  or  pluralistic   and sources of law are in French and English languages  although since the 1950s the main working language of the legal system is English   The principal court is the Royal Court  with appeals to the Jersey Court of Appeal and  ultimately  to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  The Bailiff is head of the judiciary  the Bailiff and the Deputy Bailiff are appointed by the Crown  Other members of the island s judiciary are appointed by the Bailiff   3 2  Parishes  Administratively  Jersey is divided into twelve parishes  All border on the sea  They were named after the Christian saints to whom their ancient parish churches were dedicated   The parishes of Jersey are further divided into vingtaines  or  in St  Ouen  cueillettes   divisions that are historic  Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency   The Connétable is the head of each parish  elected at a public election for a four year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the Assembly of the States of Jersey  The Procureur du Bien Public  two in each parish  is the legal and financial representative of the parish  elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the Public Elections  Amendment   Jersey  Law 2003  formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the Loi  1804  au sujet des assemblées paroissiales   A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly  The Parish Assembly is the decision making body of local government in each parish  it consists of all entitled voters of the parish   Each parish elects its own force of Honorary Police consisting of Centeniers  Vingteniers and Constable s Officers  Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish  The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders  Formerly  the senior Centenier of each parish  entitled the Chef de Police  deputised for the Connétable in the States of Jersey when the Connétable was unable to attend a sitting of the States  This function has now been abolished   3 3  International relations  Although diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown  Jersey has been developing its own international identity over recent years  It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey  Jersey maintains the Bureau de Jersey in Caen  France  a permanent non diplomatic representation  with a branch office in Rennes  A similar office  the Maison de Normandie in St  Helier  represents the Conseil général of Manche and the Regional Council of Lower Normandy  It also houses the Consulate of France  In July 2009  a Channel Islands Tunnel was proposed to connect Jersey with Lower Normandy   Jersey is a member of the British Irish Council  the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie  Jersey wants to become a full member of the Commonwealth in its own right   3 3 1  International identity  In 2007  the Chief Minister and the UK Lord Chancellor signed an agreement that established a framework for the development of the international identity of Jersey   In January 2011  the Chief Minister designated one of his assistant ministers as having responsibility for external relations  he is now often described as the island s  foreign minister    Tax information exchange agreements  TIEAs  have been signed directly by the island with several countries   3 3 2  Relationship with the European Union  Jersey is neither a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union  It does  however  have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335 5  c  TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972  However  Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission  This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972  It is easier to understand the present relationship on the basis that Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar  being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible  but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom   Under Protocol 3  Jersey is part of the European Union Customs Union of the European Community  The common customs tariff  levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non Member States  There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States  EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey  However  Article 4 of the Protocol requires the Islands authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities  In Pereira  the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable  The Island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent  as a European Territory  To infer  as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue  namely that the Island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic  in law false  The French blacklisting of the Island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out  As a result  Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services  It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital  company law or money laundering  However  the island s close proximity to  135 km south of the UK  and its close association with the financial sector of the U K  has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years  with several mainline publications  e g   The Wall Street Journal  labelling the island a tax haven   British citizens who have only a connection to Jersey  and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union  are not considered by the Jersey States to be European Union citizens  They have  Islander status  and their Jersey issued British passports are endorsed with the words the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment   However  it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens  given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol  That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or Union rights  The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside  Those rights are primary citizenship rights  not a mere freedom  It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this  merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU  and supplementary implementation measures from the Council  given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol  Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament  Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions   3 3 3  Separation debate  The question of an independent Jersey has been discussed from time to time in the Assembly of the States of Jersey  In 2005–2008  a working group of the States of Jersey examined the options for independence  concluding that Jersey  is equipped to face the challenges of independence  but making no recommendations  Proposals for Jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the States   In October 2012  the Council of Ministers issued a  Common policy for external relations  that noted  that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom  but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of Islanders to do so   On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to  ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the Island’s formal relationship with the United Kingdom and or European Union    4  Geography  Jersey is an island measuring 118 2 square kilometres  66 436 vergée    44 87 sq mi   including reclaimed land and intertidal zone  It lies in the English Channel  about from the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy  France  and about south of Great Britain  It is the largest and southernmost of the Channel Islands  with a maximum land elevation of 143 m  469 ft  above sea level at WA 57795 06708  current UTM30 grid    The climate is temperate with mild winters and mild to warm summers   The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating effect on temperature in Jersey  as water has a much greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year  This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer  The highest temperature recorded was 36 0 °C  96 8 °F  on 9 August 2003  and the lowest temperature recorded was −10 3 °C  13 5 °F  on 5 January 1894  By comparison  higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom  which achieved 38 5 °C  101 3 °F  in Faversham  Kent on 10 August 2003  The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the UK during the summer months  Snow falls rarely in Jersey  some years will pass with no snow fall at all   The terrain consists of a plateau sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north  The plateau is cut by valleys running generally north south   5  Economy  Jersey s economy is based on financial services  40% of GVA in 2012   tourism & hospitality  hotels  restaurants  bars  transport & communications totalling 8 4% of GVA in 2012   retail and wholesale  7% of GVA in 2012   construction  6 2% of GVA in 2012  and agriculture  1 3% of GVA in 2012    Thanks to specialisation in a few high return sectors  at purchasing power parity Jersey has high economic output per capita  substantially ahead of all of the world s large developed economies  Gross national income in 2009 was £3 7 billion  approximately £40 000 per head of population   However  this is not indicative of each individual resident s purchasing power  and the actual standard of living in Jersey is comparable to that in the United Kingdom outside central London  The island is recognised as one of the leading offshore financial centres  The growth of this sector however has not been without its controversies as Jersey has been characterised by critics and detractors as a place in which the  leadership has essentially been captured by global finance  and whose members will threaten and intimidate anyone who dissents   In June 2005 the States introduced the Competition  Jersey  Law 2005 to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth  This competition law was based on that of other jurisdictions   Tourism supports not only hotels  but also retail and services  in 2009 there were 685 200 visitors spending £230 million  Duty free goods are available for purchase on travel to and from the island   In 2009 57% of the Island s area was agricultural land  an increase on 2008   Major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce  agriculture s share of GVA increased 5% in 2009  a fifth successive year of growth  Jersey cattle are a small breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream  although the quality of its meat is also appreciated on a small scale  The herd total in 2009 was 5 090 animals  Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey s marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009   Farmers and growers often sell surplus food and flowers in boxes on the roadside  relying on the honesty of customers to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want  In the 21st century  diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the roadside stalls   53 460 people were employed in Jersey as of December 2010  24% in financial and legal services  16% in wholesale and retail trades  16% in the public sector  10% in education  health and other private sector services  10% in construction and quarrying  9% in hotels  restaurants and bars   Jersey along with Guernsey has its own lottery called The Channel Islands Lottery that was launched in 1975   On 18 February 2005  Jersey was granted Fairtrade Island status   5 1  Taxation  Until the 20th century  the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey  The levying of impôts  duties  different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor  Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body s tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States  leaving the Assembly of Governor  Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol  this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions   The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English  Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during World War II   Because value added tax  VAT  has not been levied in the island  luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France  providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries  The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry  whereby low value luxury items  such as videos  lingerie and contact lenses are exported  avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products  In 2005  the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non resident companies trading in this way  Low value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012  at which time this policy of the UK government was binned   Although Jersey does not have VAT  the States of Jersey introduced a goods and services tax  GST  on 6 May 2008  at a standard rate of 3%  The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011  Although GST is at 5%  shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK  Food is not exempt  unlike with VAT   Jersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation and its Zero Ten legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti avoidance legislation as of 31 December 2011  which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group  a subsidiary body of ECOFIN  The Code of Conduct Group  at least in theory  keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential  The European Commission has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument  and therefore is not legally binding  only becoming of limited  political  authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned   Jersey is ranked as a tax haven by many organisations  the Financial Secrecy Index ranks Jersey as the 9th safest tax haven in the world  ahead of Japan and behind Germany   5 2  Currency  Jersey issues its own Jersey banknotes and coins that circulate with UK coinage  Bank of England notes  Scottish notes and Guernsey currency within the island  Jersey currency is not legal tender outside Jersey  However  in the United Kingdom it is acceptable tender and can be surrendered at banks within that country in exchange for Bank of England issued currency on a like for like basis   5 2 1  Coinage  Designs on the reverse of Jersey coins   1p Le Hocq Tower  coastal defence   2p L Hermitage  site where St  Helier lived  5p Seymour Tower  offshore defence   10p La Pouquelaye de Faldouet  dolmen   20p La Corbière Lighthouse  50p Grosnez Castle  ruins  The main currency of Jersey is the pound  although in many places the euro is accepted because of the location of the island  Pound coins are issued  but are much less widely used than pound notes  Designs on the reverse of Jersey pound coins include historic ships built in Jersey and a series of the twelve parishes  crests  The motto around the milled edge of Jersey pound coins is  Island of Jersey   Two pound coins are also issued  but in very small quantities   In July 2014  the Jersey Financial Services Commission approved the establishment of the world s first regulated Bitcoin fund  at a time when the digital currency was being accepted by some local businesses   6  Demographics  Censuses have been undertaken in Jersey since 1821  In the 2011 census  the total resident population was estimated to be 97 857  of whom 34% live in Saint Helier  the island s only town  Only half the island s population was born in Jersey  31% of the population were born elsewhere in the British Isles  7% in continental Portugal or Madeira  8% in other European countries and 4% elsewhere   The people of Jersey are often called Islanders or  in individual terms  Jerseyman or Jerseywoman  Some Jersey born people identify as British and value the special relationship between the British Crown and the island   6 1  Immigration  Jersey belongs to the Common Travel Area and the definition of  United Kingdom  in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together   For immigration and nationality purposes  the United Kingdom generally treats Jersey as though it were part of the UK  Jersey is constitutionally entitled to restrict immigration by non Jersey residents  but control of immigration at the point of entry cannot be introduced for British  certain Commonwealth and EEA nationals without change to existing international law  Immigration is therefore controlled by a mixture of restrictions on those without residential status purchasing or renting property in the island and restrictions on employment  Migration policy is to move to a registration system to integrate residential and employment status  Jersey maintains its own immigration and border controls  United Kingdom immigration legislation may be extended to Jersey by order in council  subject to exceptions and adaptations  following consultation with Jersey and with Jersey s consent  Although Jersey citizens are full British citizens  an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in European Union states other than the UK is placed in the passports of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man  Those who have a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom  or who have lived in the United Kingdom for five years  are not subject to this restriction   Historical large scale immigration was facilitated by the introduction of steamships  from 1823   By 1840  up to 5 000 English people  mostly half pay officers and their families  had settled in Jersey  In the aftermath of 1848  Polish  Russian  Hungarian  Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey  Following Louis Napoléon s coup of 1851  more French proscrits arrived  By the end of the 19th century  well to do British families  attracted by the lack of income tax  were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers  establishing St Helier as a predominantly English speaking town   Seasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on Bretons and mainland Normans from the 19th century  The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom  Following Liberation in 1945  agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom – the demands of reconstruction in mainland Normandy and Brittany employed domestic labour   Until the 1960s  the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60 000  excluding the Occupation years   Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population  which is now  2013  about 100 000  From the 1960s Portuguese workers arrived  mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism   7  Religion in Jersey  Religion in Jersey has a complex history and much diversity  The established church is the Church of England  In the countryside  Methodism found its traditional stronghold  A minority of Roman Catholics can also be found in Jersey  There are two Catholic private secondary schools  De La Salle College in Saint Saviour is an all boys school  and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Helier is an all girls school  and FCJ primary school in St  Saviour  A Catholic order of Sisters has a presence in school life   8  Culture  Until the 19th century  indigenous Jèrriais – a variety of Norman – was the language of the island  though French was used for official business  During the 20th century an intense language shift took place and Jersey today is predominantly English speaking  Jèrriais nonetheless survives  around 2 600 islanders  three percent  are reckoned to be habitual speakers  and some 10 000  12 percent  in all claim some knowledge of the language  particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes  There have been efforts to revive Jèrriais in schools  and the highest number of declared Jèrriais speakers is in the capital   The dialects of Jèrriais differ in phonology and  to a lesser extent  lexis between parishes  with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east  Many place names are in Jèrriais  and French and English place names are also to be found  Anglicisation of the toponymy increased apace with the migration of English people to the island   Some Neolithic carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey  Only fragmentary wall paintings remain from the rich mediaeval artistic heritage  after the wholesale iconoclasm of the Calvinist Reformation of the 16th century   The island is particularly famous for the Battle of Flowers  a carnival held annually since 1902  Other festivals include La Fête dé Noué  Christmas festival   La Faîs sie d Cidre  cidermaking festival   the Battle of Britain air display  Jersey Live Music Festival  Branchage Film Festival  food festivals  and parish events   The island s patron saint is Saint Helier   8 1  Media  8 1 1  Broadcast  BBC Radio Jersey provides a radio service  and BBC Channel Islands News with headquarters in Jersey provides a joint television news service with Guernsey   ITV Channel Television is a regional ITV franchise shared with the Bailiwick of Guernsey but with its headquarters in Jersey   Sixbynine Ltd  an independent publisher produce the longest running lifestyle magazine  Gallery   a property magazine  Places  and an annual food publication  Appetite    Channel 103 is a commercial radio station   Bailiwick Express is one of Jersey s digital online news sources   8 1 2  Daily newspaper  Jersey has only one newspaper  the Jersey Evening Post  which is printed six days a week  and has been in publication since 1890  It is the main source for printed public notices   8 2  Music  The traditional folk music of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid 20th century  It cannot be separated from the musical traditions of continental Europe  and the majority of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants  particularly in France  Most of the surviving traditional songs are in French  with a minority in Jèrriais   In contemporary music  Nerina Pallot has enjoyed international success  Music festivals include Jersey Live  Rock in the Park  Avanchi presents Jazz in July  the music section of the Jersey Eisteddfod and the Liberation Jersey Music Festival   8 3  Cinema  In 1909  T J  West established the first cinema in the Royal Hall in St  Helier  which became known as West s Cinema in 1923  demolished 1977   The first talking picture  The Perfect Alibi  was shown on 30 December 1929 at the Picture House in St  Helier  The Jersey Film Society was founded on 11 December 1947 at the Café Bleu  West s Cinema  The large Art Deco Forum Cinema was opened in 1935 – during the German occupation this was used for German propaganda films   The Odeon Cinema was opened 2 June 1952 and  was later rebranded in the early 21st century as the Forum cinema  Its owners  however  struggled to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group  which opened a 10 screen multiplex on the waterfront centre in St  Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Odeon closed its doors in late 2008  The Odeon is now a listed building   Since 1997  Kevin Lewis  formerly of the Cine Centre and the New Forum  has arranged the Jersey Film Festival  a charity event showing the latest and also classic films outdoors in 35 mm on a big screen  The 2011 festival was held in Howard Davis Park  St Saviour  on the 13–19 August 2011   First held in 2008  the Branchage Jersey International Film Festival attracts filmmakers from all over the world   8 4  Food and drink  Seafood has traditionally been important to the cuisine of Jersey  mussels  called moules in the Island   oysters  lobster and crabs – especially spider crabs – ormers  and conger   Jersey milk being very rich  cream and butter have played a large part in insular cooking   See Channel Island milk  However there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making  contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy  but some cheese is produced commercially  Jersey fudge  mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds  is a popular food product with tourists   Jersey Royal potatoes are the local variety of new potato  and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats  small potatoes  from the south
