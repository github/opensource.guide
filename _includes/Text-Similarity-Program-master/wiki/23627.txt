A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law  protect property  and limit civil disorder  Their powers include the legitimized use of force  The term is most commonly associated with police services of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility  Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors  however  gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing   Law enforcement  however  constitutes only part of policing activity  Policing has included an array of activities in different situations  but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order  In some societies  in the late 18th and early 19th centuries  these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property  Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree  The police force is usually a public sector service  meaning they are paid through taxes   Alternative names for police force include constabulary  gendarmerie  police department  police service  crime prevention  protective services  law enforcement agency  civil guard or civic guard  Members may be referred to as police officers  troopers  sheriffs  constables  rangers  peace officers or civic civil guards   As police are often interacting with individuals  slang terms are numerous  Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymology   1  Etymology  First attested in English c 1530  the word police comes from Middle French police  in turn from Latin politia  which is the Latinisation of the Greek πολιτεία  politeia    citizenship  administration  civil polity   This is derived from πόλις  polis    city    2  History  2 1  Ancient policing  Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by  prefects  for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period  In Jin  dozens of prefects were spread across the state  each having limited authority and employment period  They were appointed by local magistrates  who reported to higher authorities such as governors  who in turn were appointed by the emperor  and they oversaw the civil administration of their  prefecture   or jurisdiction  Under each prefect were  subprefects  who helped collectively with law enforcement of the area  Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations  much like modern police detectives  Prefects could also be women  The concept of the  prefecture system  would spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan   In Ancient Greece  publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police  In Athens  a group of 300 Scythian slaves  the    rod bearers   was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for crowd control  and also assisted with dealing with criminals  handling prisoners  and making arrests  Other duties associated with modern policing  such as investigating crimes  were left to the citizens themselves   In the Roman Empire  the Army  rather than a dedicated police organization  provided security  Local watchmen were hired by cities to provide some extra security  Magistrates such as procurators fiscal and quaestors investigated crimes  There was no concept of public prosecution  so victims of crime or their families had to organize and manage the prosecution themselves   Under the reign of Augustus  when the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants  14 wards were created  the wards were protected by seven squads of 1 000 men called  vigiles   who acted as firemen and nightwatchmen  Their duties included apprehending thieves and robbers and capturing runaway slaves  The vigiles were supported by the Urban Cohorts who acted as a heavy duty anti riot force and even the Praetorian Guard if necessary   2 2  Medieval policing  In Medieval Spain  hermandades  or  brotherhoods   peacekeeping associations of armed individuals  were a characteristic of municipal life  especially in Castile  As medieval Spanish kings often could not offer adequate protection  protective municipal leagues began to emerge in the 12th century against bandits and other rural criminals  and against the lawless nobility or to support one or another claimant to a crown   These organizations were intended to be temporary  but became a long standing fixture of Spain  The first recorded case of the formation of an hermandad occurred when the towns and the peasantry of the north united to police the pilgrim road to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia  and protect the pilgrims against robber knights   Throughout the Middle Ages such alliances were frequently formed by combinations of towns to protect the roads connecting them  and were occasionally extended to political purposes  Among the most powerful was the league of North Castilian and Basque ports  the Hermandad de las marismas  Toledo  Talavera  and Villarreal   As one of their first acts after end of the War of the Castilian Succession in 1479  Ferdinand and Isabella established the centrally organized and efficient Holy Brotherhood  Santa Hermandad  as a national police force  They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves  and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases  The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police units until their final suppression in 1835   The Fehmic courts of Germany provided some policing in the absence of strong state institutions   In France during the Middle Ages  there were two Great Officers of the Crown of France with police responsibilities  The Marshal of France and the Constable of France  The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal s provost  whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal  The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years  War  and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century  Another organisation  the Constabulary  French  Connétablie   was under the command of the Constable of France  The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337  Under King Francis I  who reigned 1515–1547   the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary  The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée  or  formally  the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France   The English system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of tithings  led by a constable  which was based on a social obligation for the good conduct of the others  more common was that local lords and nobles were responsible for maintaining order in their lands  and often appointed a constable  sometimes unpaid  to enforce the law  There was also a system investigative  juries    The Assize of Arms of 1252  which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms  quell breaches of the peace  and to deliver offenders to the sheriffs or reeves  is cited as one of the earliest creation of the English police  The Statute of Winchester of 1285 is also cited as the primary legislation regulating the policing of the country between the Norman Conquest and the Metropolitan Police Act 1829   From about 1500  private watchmen were funded by private individuals and organisations to carry out police functions  They were later nicknamed  Charlies   probably after the reigning monarch King Charles II  Thief takers were also rewarded for catching thieves and returning the stolen property   The first use of the word police   Polles   in English comes from the book  The Second Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England  published in 1642   2 3  Early Modern policing  The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris  then the largest city in Europe  The royal edict  registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15  1667 created the office of lieutenant général de police   lieutenant general of police    who was to be the head of the new Paris police force  and defined the task of the police as  ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals  purging the city of what may cause disturbances  procuring abundance  and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties    This office was first held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie  who had 44 commissaires de police  police commissioners  under his authority  In 1709  these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police  police inspectors   The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires  each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy  The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699  resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns   After the French Revolution  Napoléon I reorganized the police in Paris and other cities with more than 5 000 inhabitants on February 17  1800 as the Prefecture of Police  On March 12  1829  a government decree created the first uniformed police in France  known as sergents de ville   city sergeants    which the Paris Prefecture of Police s website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world   In 1737  George II began paying some London and Middlesex watchmen with tax monies  beginning the shift to government control  In 1749 Henry Fielding began organizing a force of quasi professional constables known as the Bow Street Runners  The Macdaniel affair added further impetus for a publicly salaried police force that did not depend on rewards  Nonetheless  In 1828  there were privately financed police units in no fewer than 45 parishes within a 10 mile radius of London   The word  police  was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century  but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces  The word  and the concept of police itself  were  disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression   according to Britannica 1911   Before the 19th century  the first use of the word  police  recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798   2 4  Policing in London  In 1797  Patrick Colquhoun was able to persuade the West Indies merchants who operated at the Pool of London on the River Thames  to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500 000 worth of cargo  The idea of a police  as it then existed in France  was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import  In building the case for the police in the face of England s firm anti police sentiment  Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was  perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution   Moreover  he went so far as to praise the French system  which had reached  the greatest degree of perfection  in his estimation   With the initial investment of £4 200  the new trial force of the Thames River Police began with about 50 men charged with policing 33 000 workers in the river trades  of whom Colquhoun claimed 11 000 were known criminals and  on the game   The force was a success after its first year  and his men had  established their worth by saving £122 000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives   Word of this success spread quickly  and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800  transforming it from a private to public police agency  now the oldest police force in the world  Colquhoun published a book on the experiment  The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames  It found receptive audiences far outside London  and inspired similar forces in other cities  notably  New York City  Dublin  and Sydney   Colquhoun s utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives  Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street  the river police were full time  salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees  His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing  his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames  Colquhoun s innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel s  new  police three decades later   Meanwhile  the authorities in Glasgow  Scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police in 1800  Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament  In Ireland  the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the Royal Irish Constabulary  The Act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at Dublin Castle  By 1841 this force numbered over 8 600 men   2 4 1  Metropolitan police force  London was fast reaching a size unprecedented in world history  due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution  It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and  watchmen  was ineffective  both in detecting and preventing crime  A parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate the system of policing in London  Upon Sir Robert Peel being appointed as Home Secretary in 1822  he established a second and more effective committee  and acted upon its findings   Royal Assent to the Metropolitan Police Act was given  and the Metropolitan Police Service was established on September 29  1829 in London as the first modern and professional police force in the world   Peel  widely regarded as the father of modern policing  was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of Jeremy Bentham  who called for a strong and centralized  but politically neutral  police force for the maintenance of social order  for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible deterrent to urban crime and disorder  Peel decided to standardise the police force as an official paid profession  to organise it in a civilian fashion  and to make it answerable to the public   Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters  Peel organised the force along civilian lines  rather than paramilitary  To appear neutral  the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue  rather than red which was then a military colour  along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle to signal the need for assistance  Along with this  police ranks did not include military titles  with the exception of Sergeant   To distance the new police force from the initial public view of it as a new tool of government repression  Peel publicised the so called  Peelian Principles   which set down basic guidelines for ethical policing   Every police officer should be issued an identification number  to assure accountability for his actions   Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests  but on the lack of crime   Above all else  an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount  Hence  Peel s most often quoted principle that  The police are the public and the public are the police   The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and it s powers  and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system  Their job was apolitical  to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law  This was very different to the  Continental model  of the police force that had been developed in France  where the police force worked within the parameters of the absolutist state as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state   In 1863  the Metropolitan Police were issued with the distinctive Custodian helmet  and in 1884 they switched to the use of whistles that could be heard from much further away  The Metropolitan Police became a model for the police forces in most countries  such as the United States  and most of the British Empire  Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations   2 5  Other countries  2 5 1  Australia  In Australia the first police force having centralised command as well as jurisdiction over an entire colony was the South Australia Police  formed in 1838 under Henry Inman   However  whilst the New South Wales Police Force was established in 1862  it was made up from a large number of policing and military units operating within the then Colony of New South Wales and traces its links back to the Royal Marines  The passing of the Police Regulation Act of 1862 essentially tightly regulated and centralised all of the police forces operating throughout the Colony of New South Wales   The New South Wales Police Force remains the largest police force in Australia in terms of personnel and physical resources  It is also the only police force that requires its recruits to undertake university studies at the recruit level and has the recruit pay for their own education   2 5 2  Brazil  In 1566  the first police investigator of Rio de Janeiro was recruited  By the 17th century  most captaincies already had local units with law enforcement functions  On July 9  1775 a Cavalry Regiment was created in the state of Minas Gerais for maintaining law and order  In 1808  the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil  because of the French invasion of Portugal  King João VI established the  Intendência Geral de Polícia   General Police Intendancy  for investigations  He also created a Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro in 1809  In 1831  after independence  each province started organizing its local  military police   with order maintenance tasks  The Federal Railroad Police was created in 1852   2 5 3  Canada  In Canada  the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary was founded in 1729  making it the first police force in present day Canada  It was followed in 1834 by the Toronto Police  and in 1838 by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City  A national force  the Dominion Police  was founded in 1868  Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament  but its responsibilities quickly grew  The famous Royal Northwest Mounted Police was founded in 1873  The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police   2 5 4  Lebanon  In Lebanon  modern police were established in 1861  with creation of the Gendarmerie   2 5 5  United States  In British North America  policing was initially provided by local elected officials  For instance  the New York Sheriff s Office was founded in 1626  and the Albany County Sheriff s Department in the 1660s  In the colonial period  policing was provided by elected sheriffs and local militias   In 1789 the U S  Marshals Service was established  followed by other federal services such as the U S  Parks Police  1791  and U S  Mint Police  1792   The first city police services were established in Philadelphia in 1751  Richmond  Virginia in 1807  Boston in 1838  and New York in 1845  The U S  Secret Service was founded in 1865 and was for some time the main investigative body for the federal government  After the American Civil War  policing became more paramilitary in character  with the increased use of uniforms and military ranks  Before this  sheriff s offices had been non uniformed organizations without a para military hierarchy   In the American Old West  policing was often of very poor quality  The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced sheriffs and temporarily organised posses  Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors  notably the Pinkerton National Detective Agency  which was hired by individuals  businessmen  local governments and the federal government  At its height  the Pinkerton Agency s numbers exceeded those of the United States Army   In recent years  in addition to federal  state  and local forces  some special districts have been formed to provide extra police protection in designated areas  These districts may be known as neighborhood improvement districts  crime prevention districts  or security districts   In 2005  the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that police do not have a constitutional duty to protect a person from harm   2 6  Development of theory  Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries  most notably with Nicolas Delamare s   Treatise on the Police    first published in 1705  The German Polizeiwissenschaft  Science of Police  first theorized by Philipp von Hörnigk a 17th century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police  Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften  1937  in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however  this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault s own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14 000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520 1850   As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft  the police had an administrative economic and social duty   procuring abundance    It was in charge of demographic concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of raison d état and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the population  and unwittingly supervising the population   which  according to mercantilist theory  was to be the main strength of the state  Thus  its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included public health concerns  urban planning  which was important because of the miasma theory of disease  thus  cemeteries were moved out of town  etc    and surveillance of prices   The concept of preventive policing  or policing to deter crime from taking place  gained influence in the late 18th century  Police Magistrate John Fielding  head of the Bow Street Runners  argued that     it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice    The Utilitarian philosopher  Jeremy Bentham  promoted the views of Italian Marquis Cesare Beccaria  and disseminated a translated version of  Essay on Crime in Punishment   Bentham espoused the guiding principle of  the greatest good for the greatest number   Patrick Colquhoun s influential work  A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis  1797  was heavily influenced by Benthamite thought  Colquhoun s Thames River Police was founded on these principles  and in contrast to the Bow Street Runners  acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront  in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress   Edwin Chadwick s 1829 article   Preventive police  in the London Review  argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body  which was not the case in practice  The reason  argued Chadwick  was that  A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation   In contrast to a deterrent of punishment  a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost ineffective    crime doesn t pay   In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act  the  object  of the new Metropolitan Police  was changed by Robert Peel to the  principal object   which was the  prevention of crime   Later historians would attribute the perception of England s  appearance of orderliness and love of public order  to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel s police system   Development of modern police forces around the world was contemporary to the formation of the state  later defined by sociologist Max Weber as achieving a  monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force  and which was primarily exercised by the police and the military  Marxist theory situates the development of the modern state as part of the rise of capitalism  in which the police are one component of the bourgeoisie s repressive apparatus for subjugating the working class   3  Personnel and organization  Police forces include both preventive  uniformed  police and detectives  Terminology varies from country to country   Police functions include protecting life and property  enforcing criminal law  criminal investigations  regulating traffic  crowd control  and other public safety duties   3 1  Uniformed police  Preventive Police  also called Uniform Branch  Uniformed Police  Uniform Division  Administrative Police  Order Police  or Patrol  designates the police that patrol and respond to emergencies and other incidents  as opposed to detective services  As the name  uniformed  suggests  they wear uniforms and perform functions that require an immediate recognition of an officer s legal authority  such as traffic control  stopping and detaining motorists  and more active crime response and prevention   Preventive police almost always make up the bulk of a police service s personnel  In Australia and Britain  patrol personnel are also known as  general duties  officers  Atypically  Brazil s preventive police are known as Military Police   3 2  Detectives  Police detectives are responsible for investigations and detective work  Detectives may be called Investigations Police  Judiciary Judicial Police  and Criminal Police  In the UK  they are often referred to by the name of their department  the Criminal Investigation Department  CID   Detectives typically make up roughly 15% 25% of a police service s personnel   Detectives  in contrast to uniformed police  typically wear  business attire  in bureaucratic and investigative functions where a uniformed presence would be either a distraction or intimidating  but a need to establish police authority still exists   Plainclothes  officers dress in attire consistent with that worn by the general public for purposes of blending in   In some cases  police are assigned to work  undercover   where they conceal their police identity to investigate crimes  such as organized crime or narcotics crime  that are unsolvable by other means  In some cases this type of policing shares aspects with espionage   Despite popular conceptions promoted by movies and television  many US police departments prefer not to maintain officers in non patrol bureaus and divisions beyond a certain period of time  such as in the detective bureau  and instead maintain policies that limit service in such divisions to a specified period of time  after which officers must transfer out or return to patrol duties  This is done in part based upon the perception that the most important and essential police work is accomplished on patrol in which officers become acquainted with their beats  prevent crime by their presence  respond to crimes in progress  manage crises  and practice their skills   Detectives  by contrast  usually investigate crimes after they have occurred and after patrol officers have responded first to a situation  Investigations often take weeks or months to complete  during which time detectives spend much of their time away from the streets  in interviews and courtrooms  for example  Rotating officers also promotes cross training in a wider variety of skills  and serves to prevent  cliques  that can contribute to corruption or other unethical behavior   3 3  Auxiliary  Police may also take on auxiliary administrative duties  such as issuing firearms licenses  The extent that police have these functions varies among countries  with police in France  Germany  and other continental European countries handling such tasks to a greater extent than British counterparts   3 4  Specialized units  Specialized preventive and detective groups  or Specialist Investigation Departments exist within many law enforcement organizations either for dealing with particular types of crime  such as traffic law enforcement and crash investigation  homicide  or fraud  or for situations requiring specialized skills  such as underwater search  aviation  explosive device disposal   bomb squad    and computer crime   Most larger jurisdictions also employ specially selected and trained quasi military units armed with military grade weapons for the purposes of dealing with particularly violent situations beyond the capability of a patrol officer response  including high risk warrant service and barricaded suspects  In the United States these units go by a variety of names  but are commonly known as SWAT  Special Weapons And Tactics  teams   In counterinsurgency type campaigns  select and specially trained units of police armed and equipped as light infantry have been designated as police field forces who perform paramilitary type patrols and ambushes whilst retaining their police powers in areas that were highly dangerous   Because their situational mandate typically focuses on removing innocent bystanders from dangerous people and dangerous situations  not violent resolution  they are often equipped with non lethal tactical tools like chemical agents   flashbang  and concussion grenades  and rubber bullets  The London Metropolitan police s Specialist Firearms Command  CO19  is a group of armed police used in dangerous situations including hostage taking  armed robbery assault and terrorism   3 5  Military police  Military police may refer to   a section of the military solely responsible for policing the armed forces  referred to as provosts   a section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population  most gendarmeries  such as the French Gendarmerie  the Italian Carabinieri  the Spanish Guardia Civil and the Portuguese Republican National Guard also known as GNR   a section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population  such as the Romanian Gendarmerie   the civilian preventive police of a Brazilian state  Policia Militar   a Special Military law enforcement Service  like the Russian Military Police  3 6  Religious police  Some Islamic societies have religious police  who enforce the application of Islamic Sharia law  Their authority may include the power to arrest unrelated men and women caught socializing  anyone engaged in homosexual behavior or prostitution  to enforce Islamic dress codes  and store closures during Islamic prayer time   They enforce Muslim dietary laws  prohibit the consumption or sale of alcoholic beverages and pork  and seize banned consumer products and media regarded as un Islamic  such as CDs DVDs of various Western musical groups  television shows and film  In Saudi Arabia  the Mutaween actively prevent the practice or proselytizing of non Islamic religions within Saudi Arabia  where they are banned   4  Varying jurisdictions  Police forces are usually organized and funded by some level of government  The level of government responsible for policing varies from place to place  and may be at the national  regional or local level  In some places there may be multiple police forces operating in the same area  with different ones having jurisdiction according to the type of crime or other circumstances   For example in the UK  policing is primarily the responsibility of a regional police force  however specialist units exist at the national level  In the US  there is typically a state police force  but crimes are usually handled by local police forces that usually only cover a few municipalities  National agencies  such as the FBI  only have jurisdiction over federal crimes or those with an interstate component   In addition to conventional urban or regional police forces  there are other police forces with specialized functions or jurisdiction  In the United States  the federal government has a number of police forces with their own specialized jurisdictions   Some examples are the Federal Protective Service  which patrols and protects government buildings  the postal police  which protect postal buildings  vehicles and items  the Park Police  which protect national parks  or Amtrak Police which patrol Amtrak stations and trains   There are also some government agencies that perform police functions in addition to other duties  The U S  Coast Guard carries out many police functions for boaters   In major cities  there may be a separate police agency for public transit systems  such as the New York City Port Authority Police or the MTA police  or for major government functions  such as sanitation  or environmental functions   5  International policing  The terms international policing  transnational policing  and or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation state  Nadelmann  1993    Sheptycki  1995   These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that  in some sense  transcend national borders  This includes a variety of practices  but international police cooperation  criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation states  and police development aid to weak  failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention   Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross border police missions for many years  Deflem  2002   For example  in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals  A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London  The interests of public police agencies in cross border co operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe  which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War  There are also many interesting examples of cross border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century  Nadelmann  1993   It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception  It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent  Sheptycki  2000    Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken  A notable exception is James Sheptycki s study of police cooperation in the English Channel region  2002   which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case work  The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned  By 1992  with the signing of the Schengen Treaty  which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the European Union  there were worries that much  if not all  of this intelligence sharing was opaque  raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe  Joubert and Bevers  1996    Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer  so it is difficult to make generalizations  but one small scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature  Alain  2001   Intelligence led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries  Ratcliffe  2007  and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world  Ratcliffe  2007   James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing intelligence and suggests that a number of  organizational pathologies  have arisen that make the functioning of security intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic  He argues that transnational police information circuits help to  compose the panic scenes of the security control society   The paradoxical effect is that  the harder policing agencies work to produce security  the greater are feelings of insecurity   Police development aid to weak  failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention  This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead  especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict  Goldsmith and Sheptycki  2007  With transnational police development aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions  Hills  2009    Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is  in whose interest is it  At a more practical level  the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable  Sheptycki  2004   For example  according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007  Lloyd  et al  2007  Interpol had the lowest scores in its category  IGOs   coming in tenth with a score of 22% on overall accountability capabilities  p  19   As this report points out  and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm  this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement   6  Equipment  6 1  Weapons  In many jurisdictions  police officers carry firearms  primarily handguns  in the normal course of their duties  In the United Kingdom  except Northern Ireland   Iceland  Ireland  Norway  New Zealand  and Malta  with the exception of specialist units  officers do not carry firearms as a matter of course   Police often have specialist units for handling armed offenders  and similar dangerous situations  and can  depending on local laws   in some extreme circumstances  call on the military  since Military Aid to the Civil Power is a role of many armed forces   Perhaps the most high profile example of this was  in 1980 the Metropolitan Police handing control of the Iranian Embassy Siege to the Special Air Service   They can also be equipped with non lethal  more accurately known as  less than lethal  or  less lethal   weaponry  particularly for riot control  Non lethal weapons include batons  tear gas  riot control agents  rubber bullets  riot shield  water cannons and electroshock weapons  Police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects  The use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life  although some jurisdictions  such as Brazil  allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts  A  shoot to kill  policy was recently introduced in South Africa  which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians  With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime  president Jacob Zuma states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently to other countries   6 2  Communications  Modern police forces make extensive use of radio communications equipment  carried both on the person and installed in vehicles  to co ordinate their work  share information  and get help quickly  In recent years  vehicle installed computers have enhanced the ability of police communications  enabling easier dispatching of calls  criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds  and updating the officer s daily activity log and other required reports on a real time basis  Other common pieces of police equipment include flashlights torches  whistles  and police notebooks and  ticketbooks  or citations   6 3  Vehicles  Police vehicles are used for detaining  patrolling and transporting  The average police patrol vehicle is an specially modified four door sedan  saloon in British English   Police vehicles are usually marked with appropriate logos and are equipped with sirens and lightbars to aid in making others aware of police presence   Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence  Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement  since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators  This practice is controversial  with for example  New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people impersonating police officers   Motorcycles are also commonly used  particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach  to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where the motorcycle policeman can quickly clear a path for the escorted vehicle  Bicycle patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public  In addition  their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot   Police departments use an array of specialty vehicles such as helicopters  airplanes  watercraft  command posts  vans  trucks  all terrain vehicles  motorcycles  and SWAT armored vehicles   6 3 1  Other safety equipment  Police cars may also contain fire extinguishers or defibrillators   7  Strategies  The advent of the police car  two way radio  and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service  With this transformation  police command and control became more centralized   In the United States  August Vollmer introduced other reforms  including education requirements for police officers  O W  Wilson  a student of Vollmer  helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita  Kansas  and later in the Chicago Police Department  Strategies employed by O W  Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption  establishing of a non partisan police board to help govern the police force  a strict merit system for promotions within the department  and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers  During the professionalism era of policing  law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime  rather than broader focus on crime prevention   The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the 1970s found this approach to policing to be ineffective  Patrol officers in cars were disconnected from the community  and had insufficient contact and interaction with the community  In the 1980s and 1990s  many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies  and others adopted problem oriented policing   Broken windows policing was another  related approach introduced in the 1980s by James Q  Wilson and George L  Kelling  who suggested that police should pay greater attention to minor  quality of life  offenses and disorderly conduct  This method was first introduced and made popular by New York City Mayor  Rudy Giuliani  in the early 1990s   The concept behind this method is simple  broken windows  graffiti  and other physical destruction or degradation of property  greatly increases the chances of more criminal activities and destruction of property  When criminals see the abandoned vehicles  trash  and deplorable property  they assume that authorities do not care and do not take active approaches to correct problems in these areas  Therefore  correcting the small problems prevents more serious criminal activity   Building upon these earlier models  intelligence led policing has emerged as the dominant philosophy guiding police strategy  Intelligence led policing and problem oriented policing are complementary strategies  both which involve systematic use of information  Although it still lacks a universally accepted definition  the crux of intelligence led policing is an emphasis on the collection and analysis of information to guide police operations  rather than the reverse   8  Power restrictions  In many nations  criminal procedure law has been developed to regulate officers  discretion  so that they do not arbitrarily or unjustly exercise their powers of arrest  search and seizure  and use of force  In the United States  Miranda v  Arizona led to the widespread use of Miranda warnings or constitutional warnings   In Miranda the court created safeguards against self incriminating statements made after an arrest  The court held that  The prosecution may not use statements  whether exculpatory or inculpatory  stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way  unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment s privilege against self incrimination   Police in the United States are also prohibited from holding criminal suspects for more than a reasonable amount of time  usually 24–48 hours  before arraignment  using torture  abuse or physical threats to extract confessions  using excessive force to effect an arrest  and searching suspects  bodies or their homes without a warrant obtained upon a showing of probable cause  The four exceptions to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant are   Consent  Search incident to arrest  Motor vehicle searches  Exigent circumstances In Terry v  Ohio  1968  the court divided seizure into two parts  the investigatory stop and arrest  The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer s search    is  confined to what  is  minimally necessary to determine whether  a suspect  is armed  and the intrusion  which  is  made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby   is  confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons   U S  Supreme Court   Before Terry  every police encounter constituted an arrest  giving the police officer the full range of search authority  Search authority during a Terry stop  investigatory stop  is limited to weapons only   Using deception for confessions is permitted  but not coercion  There are exceptions or exigent circumstances such as an articulated need to disarm a suspect or searching a suspect who has already been arrested  Search Incident to an Arrest   The Posse Comitatus Act severely restricts the use of the military for police activity  giving added importance to police SWAT units   British police officers are governed by similar rules  such as those introduced to England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984  PACE   but generally have greater powers  They may  for example  legally search any suspect who has been arrested  or their vehicles  home or business premises  without a warrant  and may seize anything they find in a search as evidence   All police officers in the United Kingdom  whatever their actual rank  are  constables  in terms of their legal position  This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner  However  certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations  such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect s house  section 18 PACE in England and Wales  by an officer of the rank of Inspector  or the power to authorize a suspect s detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent   9  Conduct  accountability and public confidence  Police services commonly include units for investigating crimes committed by the police themselves  These units are typically called Inspectorate General  or in the US   internal affairs   In some countries separate organizations outside the police exist for such purposes  such as the British Independent Police Complaints Commission   Likewise  some state and local jurisdictions  for example  Springfield  Illinois have similar outside review organizations  The Police Service of Northern Ireland is investigated by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland  an external agency set up as a result of the Patten report into policing the province  In the Republic of Ireland the Garda Síochána is investigated by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission  an independent commission that replaced the Garda Complaints Board in May 2007   The Special Investigations Unit of Ontario  Canada  is one of only a few civilian agencies around the world responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in a death  serious injury  or allegations of sexual assault  The agency has made allegations of insufficient cooperation from various police services hindering their investigations   In Hong Kong  any allegations of corruption within the police will be investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Independent Police Complaints Council  two agencies which are independent of the police force   Due to a long term decline in public confidence for law enforcement in the United States  body cameras worn by police officers are under consideration   9 1  Use of force  Police forces also find themselves under criticism for their use of force  particularly deadly force  Specifically  tension increases when a police officer of one ethnic group harms or kills a suspect of another one  In the United States  such events occasionally spark protests and accusations of racism against police and allegations that police departments practice racial profiling   In the United States since the 1960s  concern over such issues has increasingly weighed upon law enforcement agencies  courts and legislatures at every level of government  Incidents such as the 1965 Watts Riots  the videotaped 1991 beating by Los Angeles Police officers of Rodney King  and the riot following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U S  police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls   The fact that this trend has occurred contemporaneously with the rise of the US civil rights movement  the  War on Drugs   and a precipitous rise in violent crime from the 1960s to the 1990s has made questions surrounding the role  administration and scope of police authority increasingly complicated   Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community outreach programs and community policing to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities  by working to increase hiring diversity  by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law  and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions   In cases in which such measures have been lacking or absent  civil lawsuits have been brought by the United States Department of Justice against local law enforcement agencies  authorized under the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act  This has compelled local departments to make organizational changes  enter into consent decree settlements to adopt such measures  and submit to oversight by the Justice Department   9 2  Protection of individuals  Since 1855  the Supreme Court of the United States has consistently ruled that law enforcement officers have no duty to protect any individual  despite the motto  protect and serve   Their duty is to enforce the law in general  The first such case was in 1855    and the most recent in 2005  Town of Castle Rock v  Gonzales    In contrast  the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions  To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law  some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time  and where  without interference of the police  the realization of the private right would be impeded  This would  for example  allow police to establish a restaurant guest s identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table   In addition  there are Federal Law Enforcement agencies in the United States whose mission includes providing protection for executives such as the President and accompanying family members  visiting foreign dignitaries  and other high ranking individuals  Such agencies include The United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police   10  International forces  In many countries  particularly those with a federal system of government  there may be several police or police like organizations  each serving different levels of government and enforcing different subsets of the applicable law  The United States has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement  with over 17 000 state and local law enforcement agencies   Some countries  such as Chile  Israel  the Philippines  France  Austria  New Zealand and South Africa  use a centralized system of policing  Other countries have multiple police forces  but for the most part their jurisdictions do not overlap  In the United States however  several different law enforcement agencies may have authority in a particular jurisdiction at the same time  each with their own command   Other countries where jurisdiction of multiple police agencies overlap  include Guardia Civil and the Policía Nacional in Spain  the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri in Italy and the Police Nationale and National Gendarmerie in France   Most countries are members of the International Criminal Police Organization  Interpol   established to detect and fight transnational crime and provide for international co operation and co ordination of other police activities  such as notifying relatives of the death of foreign nationals  Interpol does not conduct investigations or arrests by itself  but only serves as a central point for information on crime  suspects and criminals  Political crimes are excluded from its competencies   11  See also  Chief of police  Constable  Criminal
