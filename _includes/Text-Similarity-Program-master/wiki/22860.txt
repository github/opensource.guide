The Paleolithic  American spelling  British spelling  Palaeolithic  pronunciation  or   Age  Era or Period is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered  Grahame Clark s Modes I and II   and covers roughly 95% of human technological prehistory  It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools  probably by hominins such as australopithecines  2 6 million years ago  to the end of the Pleistocene around 10 000 BP   The Paleolithic era is followed by the Mesolithic  The date of the Paleolithic—Mesolithic boundary may vary by locality as much as several thousand years  During the Paleolithic period  humans grouped together in small societies such as bands  and subsisted by gathering plants and fishing  hunting or scavenging wild animals  The Paleolithic is characterized by the use of knapped stone tools  although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools  Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools  including leather and vegetable fibers  however  due to their nature  these have not been preserved to any great degree  Surviving artifacts of the Paleolithic era are known as paleoliths  Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus Homo such as Homo habilis – who used simple stone tools – into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans  Homo sapiens  during the Paleolithic era  During the end of the Paleolithic  specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic  humans began to produce the earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual  The climate during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures   The term  Paleolithic  was coined by archaeologist John Lubbock in 1865  It derives from Greek  παλαιός  palaios   old   and λίθος  lithos   stone   meaning  old age of the stone  or  Old Stone Age    1  Human evolution  Human evolution is the part of biological evolution concerning the emergence of humans as a distinct species   2  Paleogeography and climate  The Paleolithic Period coincides almost exactly with the Pleistocene epoch of geologic time  which lasted from 2 6 million years ago to about 12 000 years ago  This epoch experienced important geographic and climatic changes that affected human societies   During the preceding Pliocene  continents had continued to drift from possibly as far as 250 km from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current location  South America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama  bringing a nearly complete end to South America s distinctive marsupial fauna  The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures  because warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off  and the cold Arctic and Antarctic waters lowered temperatures in the now isolated Atlantic Ocean  Most of Central America formed during the Pliocene to connect the continents of North and South America  allowing fauna from these continents to leave their native habitats and colonize new areas  Africa s collision with Asia created the Mediterranean Sea  cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean  During the Pleistocene  the modern continents were essentially at their present positions  the tectonic plates on which they sit have probably moved at most 100 km from each other since the beginning of the period   Climates during the Pliocene became cooler and drier  and seasonal  similar to modern climates  Ice sheets grew on Antarctica  The formation of an Arctic ice cap around three million years ago is signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean beds  Mid latitude glaciation probably began before the end of the epoch  The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas   The Pleistocene climate was characterized by repeated glacial cycles during which continental glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places  Four major glacial events have been identified  as well as many minor intervening events  A major event is a general glacial excursion  termed a  glacial   Glacials are separated by  interglacials   During a glacial  the glacier experiences minor advances and retreats  The minor excursion is a  stadial   times between stadials are  interstadials   Each glacial advance tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets 1500–3000 m deep  resulting in temporary sea level drops of 100 m or more over the entire surface of the Earth  During interglacial times  such as at present  drowned coastlines were common  mitigated by isostatic or other emergent motion of some regions  The effects of glaciation were global  Antarctica was ice bound throughout the Pleistocene and the preceding Pliocene  The Andes were covered in the south by the Patagonian ice cap  There were glaciers in New Zealand and Tasmania  The now decaying glaciers of Mount Kenya  Mount Kilimanjaro  and the Ruwenzori Range in east and central Africa were larger  Glaciers existed in the mountains of Ethiopia and to the west in the Atlas mountains  In the northern hemisphere  many glaciers fused into one  The Cordilleran ice sheet covered the North American northwest  the Laurentide covered the east  The Fenno Scandian ice sheet covered northern Europe  including Great Britain  the Alpine ice sheet covered the Alps  Scattered domes stretched across Siberia and the Arctic shelf  The northern seas were frozen  During the late Upper Paleolithic  Latest Pleistocene  c  18 000 BP  the Beringia land bridge between Asia and North America was blocked by ice  which may have prevented early Paleo Indians such as the Clovis culture from directly crossing Beringa to reach the Americas   According to Mark Lynas  through collected data   the Pleistocene s overall climate could be characterized as a continuous El Niño with trade winds in the south Pacific weakening or heading east  warm air rising near Peru  warm water spreading from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific  and other El Niño markers   The Paleolithic is often held to finish at the end of the ice age  the end of the Pleistocene epoch   and Earth s climate became warmer  This may have caused or contributed to the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna  although it is also possible that the late Pleistocene extinctions were  at least in part  caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans  New research suggests that the extinction of the woolly mammoth may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting  Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths  habitat to shrink in size  resulting in a drop in population  The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans  The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible  Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands  Saint Paul Island and Wrangel Island  till circa 3700 and 1700 BCE respectively  The Wrangel Island population went extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans  There s no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island  though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on nearby Aleutian Islands    3  Human way of life  Due to a lack of written records from this time period   nearly all of our knowledge of Paleolithic human culture and way of life comes from archaeology and ethnographic comparisons to modern hunter gatherer cultures such as the  Kung San who live similarly to their Paleolithic predecessors  The economy of a typical Paleolithic society was a hunter gatherer economy  Humans hunted wild animals for meat and gathered food  firewood  and materials for their tools  clothes  or shelters  Human population density was very low  around only one person per square mile  This was most likely due to low body fat  infanticide  women regularly engaging in intense endurance exercise  late weaning of infants and a nomadic lifestyle  Like contemporary hunter gatherers  Paleolithic humans enjoyed an abundance of leisure time unparalleled in both Neolithic farming societies and modern industrial societies  At the end of the Paleolithic  specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic  humans began to produce works of art such as cave paintings  rock art and jewellery and began to engage in religious behavior such as burial and ritual   3 1  Distribution  At the beginning of the Paleolithic  hominids were found primarily in eastern Africa  east of the Great Rift Valley  Most known hominid fossils dating earlier than one million years before present are found in this area  particularly in Kenya  Tanzania  and Ethiopia   By 1 5 2 million years before present  groups of hominids began leaving Africa and settling southern Europe and Asia  Southern Caucasus was occupied by 1 7 million years BP  and northern China was reached by 1 66 million years BP  By the end of the Lower Paleolithic  members of the hominid family were living in what is now China  western Indonesia  and  in Europe  around the Mediterranean and as far north as England  southern Germany  and Bulgaria  Their further northward expansion may have been limited by the lack of control of fire  studies of cave settlements in Europe indicate no regular use of fire prior to 300 000 400 000 BP  East Asian fossils from this period are typically placed in the genus Homo erectus  Very little fossil evidence is available at known Lower Paleolithic sites in Europe  but it is believed that hominids who inhabited these sites were likewise Homo erectus  There is no evidence of hominids in America  Australia  or almost anywhere in Oceania during this time period   Fates of these early colonists  and their relationships to modern humans  are still subject to debate  According to current archeological and genetic models  there were at least two notable expansion events subsequent to peopling of Eurasia 2 1 5 million years BP  Around 500 000 BP  a group of early humans  frequently called Homo heidelbergensis  came to Europe from Africa and eventually evolved into Neanderthals  Both Homo erectus and Neanderthals went extinct by the end of the Paleolithic  having been replaced by a new wave of humans  the anatomically modern Homo sapiens  which emerged in eastern Africa circa 200 000 BP  left Africa around 50 000 BP and expanded throughout the planet  It is likely that multiple groups coexisted for some time in certain locations  Neanderthals were still found in parts of Eurasia 30 000 years before present  and engaged in a limited degree of interbreeding with Homo sapiens  Hominid fossils not belonging either to Homo neanderthalensis or to Homo sapiens geni  found in Altai and Indonesia  were radiocarbon dated to 30 000 40 000 BP and 17 000 BP respectively   The technological revolution of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic allowed humans to reach places that weren t accessible earlier  In the Middle Paleolithic  Neanderthals were present in Poland  By 40 000 50 000 BP  first humans set foot in Australia  By 45 000 BP  humans lived at 61° north latitude in Europe  By 30 000 BP  Japan was reached  and by 27 000 BP humans were present in Siberia above the Arctic Circle  At the end of the Upper Paleolithic  a group of humans crossed the Bering land bridge and quickly expanded throughout North and South America  Northern Eurasia became depopulated during the last Glacial Maximum  27 000 to 16 000 BP   but was repopulated as the climate got warmer and glaciers retreated   For the duration of the Paleolithic  human populations remained low  especially outside the equatorial region  The entire population of Europe between 16 000 11 000 BP likely averaged some 30 000 individuals  and  between 40 000 16 000 BP  it was even lower  at 4 000 6 000 individuals   3 2  Technology  3 2 1  Tools  Paleolithic humans made tools of stone  bone  and wood  The early paleolithic hominids  Australopithecus  were the first users of stone tools  Excavations in Gona  Ethiopia have produced thousands of artifacts  and through radioisotopic dating and magnetostratigraphy  the sites can be firmly dated to 2 6 million years ago  Evidence shows these early hominids intentionally selected raw materials with good flaking qualities and chose appropriate sized stones for their needs to produce sharp edged tools for cutting  The earliest Paleolithic stone tool industry  the Olduwan  began around 2 6 million years ago  It contained tools such as choppers  burins and awls  It was completely replaced around 250 000 years ago by the more complex Acheulean industry  which was first conceived by Homo ergaster around 1 8 or 1 65 million years ago  The most recent Lower Paleolithic  Acheulean  implements completely vanished from the archeological record around 100 000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic Middle Stone Age tool kits such as the Mousterian and the Aterian industries   Lower Paleolithic humans used a variety of stone tools  including hand axes and choppers  Although they appear to have used hand axes often  there is disagreement about their use  Interpretations range from cutting and chopping tools  to digging implements  flake cores  the use in traps and a purely ritual significance  maybe in courting behavior  William H  Calvin has suggested that some hand axes could have served as  killer Frisbees  meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a water hole so as to stun one of them  There are no indications of hafting  and some artifacts are far too large for that  Thus  a thrown hand axe would not usually have penetrated deeply enough to cause very serious injuries  Nevertheless  it could have been an effective weapon for defense against predators  Choppers and scrapers were likely used for skinning and butchering scavenged animals and sharp ended sticks were often obtained for digging up edible roots  Presumably  early humans used wooden spears as early as five million years ago to hunt small animals  much as their relatives  chimpanzees  have been observed to do in Senegal  Africa  Lower Paleolithic humans constructed shelters such as the possible wood hut at Terra Amata   3 2 2  Fire use  Fire was used by the Lower Paleolithic hominid Homo erectus Homo ergaster as early as 300 000 or 1 5 million years ago and possibly even earlier by the early Lower Paleolithic  Oldowan  hominid Homo habilis and or by robust australopithecines such as Paranthropus  However  the use of fire only became common in the societies of the following Middle Stone Age Middle Paleolithic Period  Use of fire reduced mortality rates and provided protection against predators  Early hominids may have begun to cook their food as early as the Lower Paleolithic  c  1 9 million years ago  or at the latest in the early Middle Paleolithic  c  250 000 years ago   Some scientists have hypothesized that Hominids began cooking food to defrost frozen meat  which would help ensure their survival in cold regions   3 2 3  Rafts  The Lower Paleolithic hominid Homo erectus possibly invented rafts  c  800 000 or 840 000 BP  to travel over large bodies of water  which may have allowed a group of Homo erectus to reach the island of Flores and evolve into the small hominid Homo floresiensis  However  this hypothesis is disputed within the anthropological community  The possible use of rafts during the Lower Paleolithic may indicate that Lower Paleolithic Hominids such as Homo erectus were more advanced than previously believed  and may have even spoken an early form of modern language  Supplementary evidence from Neanderthal and Modern human sites located around the Mediterranean Sea such as Coa de sa Multa  c  300 000 BP  has also indicated that both Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans used rafts to travel over large bodies of water  i e  the Mediterranean Sea  for the purpose of colonizing other bodies of land   3 2 4  Advanced tools  Around 200 000 BP  Middle Paleolithic Stone tool manufacturing spawned a tool making technique known as the prepared core technique  that was more elaborate than previous Acheulean techniques  This technique increased efficiency by allowing the creation of more controlled and consistent flakes  It allowed Middle Paleolithic humans to create stone tipped spears  which were the earliest composite tools  by hafting sharp  pointy stone flakes onto wooden shafts  In addition to improving tool making methods  the Middle Paleolithic also saw an improvement of the tools themselves that allowed access to a wider variety and amount of food sources  For example microliths or small stone tools or points were invented around 70 000 or 65 000 BP and were essential to the invention of bows and spear throwers in the following Upper Paleolithic period  Harpoons were invented and used for the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic  c 90 000 years ago   the invention of these devices brought fish into the human diets  which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply  Thanks to their technology and their advanced social structures  Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals who had a Middle Paleolithic level of technology  appear to have hunted large game just as well as Upper Paleolithic modern humans and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons  Nonetheless  Neanderthal use of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely  or perhaps never  and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with mêlée weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons   3 2 5  Other inventions  During the Upper Paleolithic  further inventions were made  such as the net  c  22 000 or 29 000 BP  bolas  the spear thrower  c 30 000 BP   the bow and arrow  c  25 000 or 30 000 BP  and the oldest example of ceramic art  the Venus of Dolní Věstonice  c  29 000–25 000 BCE   Early dogs were domesticated  sometime between 30 000 BP and 14 000 BP  presumably to aid in hunting  However  the earliest instances of successful domestication of dogs may be much more ancient than this  Evidence from canine DNA collected by Robert K  Wayne suggests that dogs may have been first domesticated in the late Middle Paleolithic around 100 000 BP or perhaps even earlier  Archeological evidence from the Dordogne region of France demonstrates that members of the European early Upper Paleolithic culture known as the Aurignacian used calendars  c  30 000 BP   This was a lunar calendar that was used to document the phases of the moon  Genuine solar calendars did not appear until the following Neolithic period  Upper Paleolithic cultures were probably able to time the migration of game animals such as wild horses and deer  This ability allowed humans to become efficient hunters and to exploit a wide variety of game animals  Recent research indicates that the Neanderthals timed their hunts and the migrations of game animals long before the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic   3 3  Social organization  The social organization of the earliest Paleolithic  Lower Paleolithic  societies remains largely unknown to scientists  though Lower Paleolithic hominids such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus are likely to have had more complex social structures than chimpanzee societies  Late Oldowan Early Acheulean humans such as Homo ergaster Homo erectus may have been the first people to invent central campsites or home bases and incorporate them into their foraging and hunting strategies like contemporary hunter gatherers  possibly as early as 1 7 million years ago  however  the earliest solid evidence for the existence of home bases or central campsites  hearths and shelters  among humans only dates back to 500 000 years ago   Similarly  scientists disagree whether Lower Paleolithic humans were largely monogamous or polygynous  In particular  the Provisional model suggests that bipedalism arose in Pre Paleolithic australopithecine societies as an adaptation to monogamous lifestyles  however  other researchers note that sexual dimorphism is more pronounced in Lower Paleolithic humans such as Homo erectus than in Modern humans  who are less polygynous than other primates  which suggests that Lower Paleolithic humans had a largely polygynous lifestyle  because species that have the most pronounced sexual dimorphism tend more likely to be polygynous   Human societies from the Paleolithic to the early Neolithic farming tribes lived without states and organized governments  For most of the Lower Paleolithic  human societies were possibly more hierarchical than their Middle and Upper Paleolithic descendants  and probably were not grouped into bands  though during the end of the Lower Paleolithic  the latest populations of the hominid Homo erectus may have begun living in small scale  possibly egalitarian  bands similar to both Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies and modern hunter gatherers   Middle Paleolithic societies  unlike Lower Paleolithic and early Neolithic ones  consisted of bands that ranged from 20 to 30 or 25 to 100 members and were usually nomadic  These bands were formed by several families  Bands sometimes joined together into larger  macrobands  for activities such as acquiring mates and celebrations or where resources were abundant  By the end of the Paleolithic era  about 10 000 BP people began to settle down into permanent locations  and began to rely on agriculture for sustenance in many locations  Much evidence exists that humans took part in long distance trade between bands for rare commodities  such as ochre  which was often used for religious purposes such as ritual  and raw materials  as early as 120 000 years ago in Middle Paleolithic  Inter band trade may have appeared during the Middle Paleolithic because trade between bands would have helped ensure their survival by allowing them to exchange resources and commodities such as raw materials during times of relative scarcity  i e  famine  drought   Like in modern hunter gatherer societies  individuals in Paleolithic societies may have been subordinate to the band as a whole  Both Neanderthals and modern humans took care of the elderly members of their societies during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic   Some sources claim that most Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies were possibly fundamentally egalitarian and may have rarely or never engaged in organized violence between groups  i e  war   Some Upper Paleolithic societies in resource rich environments  such as societies in Sungir  in what is now Russia  may have had more complex and hierarchical organization  such as tribes with a pronounced hierarchy and a somewhat formal division of labor  and may have engaged in endemic warfare  Some argue that there was no formal leadership during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic  Like contemporary egalitarian hunter gatherers such as the Mbuti pygmies  societies may have made decisions by communal consensus decision making rather than by appointing permanent rulers such as chiefs and monarchs  Nor was there a formal division of labor during the Paleolithic  Each member of the group was skilled at all tasks essential to survival  regardless of individual abilities  Theories to explain the apparent egalitarianism have arisen  notably the Marxist concept of primitive communism  Christopher Boehm  1999  has hypothesized that egalitarianism may have evolved in Paleolithic societies because of a need to distribute resources such as food and meat equally to avoid famine and ensure a stable food supply  Raymond C  Kelly speculates that the relative peacefulness of Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies resulted from a low population density  cooperative relationships between groups such as reciprocal exchange of commodities and collaboration on hunting expeditions  and because the invention of projectile weapons such as throwing spears provided less incentive for war  because they increased the damage done to the attacker and decreased the relative amount of territory attackers could gain  However  other sources claim that most Paleolithic groups may have been larger  more complex  sedentary and warlike than most contemporary hunter gatherer societies  due to occupying more resource abundant areas than most modern hunter gatherers who have been pushed into more marginal habitats by agricultural societies   Anthropologists have typically assumed that in Paleolithic societies  women were responsible for gathering wild plants and firewood  and men were responsible for hunting and scavenging dead animals  However  analogies to existent hunter gatherer societies such as the Hadza people and the Australian aborigines suggest that the sexual division of labor in the Paleolithic was relatively flexible  Men may have participated in gathering plants  firewood and insects  and women may have procured small game animals for consumption and assisted men in driving herds of large game animals  such as woolly mammoths and deer  off cliffs  Additionally  recent research by anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona is argued to support that this division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic and was invented relatively recently in human pre history  Sexual division of labor may have been developed to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently  Possibly there was approximate parity between men and women during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic  and that period may have been the most gender equal time in human history  Archeological evidence from art and funerary rituals indicates that a number of individual women enjoyed seemingly high status in their communities  and it is likely that both sexes participated in decision making  The earliest known Paleolithic shaman  c  30 000 BP  was female  Jared Diamond suggests that the status of women declined with the adoption of agriculture because women in farming societies typically have more pregnancies and are expected to do more demanding work than women in hunter gatherer societies  Like most contemporary hunter gatherer societies  Paleolithic and the Mesolithic groups probably followed mostly matrilineal and ambilineal descent patterns  patrilineal descent patterns were probably rarer than in the following Neolithic period   3 4  Art and music  Early examples of artistic expression  such as the Venus of Tan Tan and the patterns found on elephant bones from Bilzingsleben in Thuringia  may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as Homo erectus prior to the start of the Middle Paleolithic period  However  the earliest undisputed evidence of art during the Paleolithic period comes from Middle Paleolithic Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos Cave –South Africa– in the form of bracelets  beads  rock art  and ochre used as body paint and perhaps in ritual  Undisputed evidence of art only becomes common in the following Upper Paleolithic period   According to Robert G  Bednarik  Lower Paleolithic Acheulean tool users began to engage in symbolic behavior such as art around 850 000 BP and decorated themselves with beads and collected exotic stones for aesthetic rather than utilitarian qualities  According to Bednarik  traces of the pigment ochre from late Lower Paleolithic Acheulean archeological sites suggests that Acheulean societies  like later Upper Paleolithic societies  collected and used ochre to create rock art  Nevertheless  it is also possible that the ochre traces found at Lower Paleolithic sites is naturally occurring   Vincent W  Fallio interprets Lower and Middle Paleolithic marking on rocks at sites such as Bilzingsleben  such as zig zagging lines  as accounts or representation of altered states of consciousness though some other scholars interpret them as either simple doodling or as the result of natural processes   Upper Paleolithic humans produced works of art such as cave paintings  Venus figurines  animal carvings and rock paintings  Upper Paleolithic art can be divided into two broad categories  figurative art such as cave paintings that clearly depicts animals  or more rarely humans   and nonfigurative  which consists of shapes and symbols  Cave paintings have been interpreted in a number of ways by modern archeologists  The earliest explanation  by the prehistorian Abbe Breuil  interpreted the paintings as a form of magic designed to ensure a successful hunt  However  this hypothesis fails to explain the existence of animals such as saber toothed cats and lions  which were not hunted for food  and the existence of half human  half animal beings in cave paintings  The anthropologist David Lewis Williams has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of shamanistic practices  because the paintings of half human  half animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter gatherer shamanistic practices  Symbol like images are more common in Paleolithic cave paintings than are depictions of animals or humans  and unique symbolic patterns might have been trademarks that represent different Upper Paleolithic ethnic groups  Venus figurines have evoked similar controversy  Archeologists and anthropologists have described the figurines as representations of goddesses  pornographic imagery  apotropaic amulets used for sympathetic magic  and even as self portraits of women themselves   R  Dale Guthrie has studied not only the most artistic and publicized paintings  but also a variety of lower quality art and figurines  and he identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists  He also points out that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts  powerful beasts  risky hunting scenes and the over sexual representation of women  are to be expected in the fantasies of adolescent males during the Upper Paleolithic   The Venus figurines have sometimes been interpreted as representing a mother goddess  the abundance of such female imagery has led some to believe that Upper Paleolithic  and later Neolithic  societies had a female centered religion and a female dominated society  For example  this was proposed by the archeologist Marija Gimbutas and the feminist scholar Merlin Stone who was the author of the 1978 book When God Was a Woman  Various other explanations for the purpose of the figurines have been proposed  such as Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott’s hypothesis that the figurines were created as self portraits of actual women and R Dale Gutrie s hypothesis that the venus figurines represented a kind of  stone age pornography    The origins of music during the Paleolithic are unknown  since the earliest forms of music probably did not use musical instruments but instead used the human voice and or natural objects such as rocks  which leave no trace in the archaeological record  However  the anthropological and archeological designation suggests that human music first arose when language  art and other modern behaviors developed in the Middle or the Upper Paleolithic period  Music may have developed from rhythmic sounds produced by daily activities such as cracking nuts by hitting them with stones  because maintaining a rhythm while working may have helped people to become more efficient at daily activities  An alternative theory originally proposed by Charles Darwin explains that music may have begun as a hominid mating strategy as many birds and some other animals produce music like calls to attract mates  This hypothesis is generally less accepted than the previous hypothesis  but it nonetheless provides a possible alternative  Another explanation is that humans began to make music simply because of the pleasure it produced   Upper Paleolithic  and possibly Middle Paleolithic  humans used flute like bone pipes as musical instruments  and music may have played a large role in the religious lives of Upper Paleolithic hunter gatherers  As with modern hunter gatherer societies  music may have been used in ritual or to help induce trances  In particular  it appears that animal skin drums may have been used in religious events by Upper Paleolithic shamans  as shown by the remains of drum like instruments from some Upper Paleolithic graves of shamans and the ethnographic record of contemporary hunter gatherer shamanic and ritual practices   3 5  Religion and beliefs  According to James B  Harrod humankind first developed religious and spiritual beliefs during the Middle Paleolithic or Upper Paleolithic  Controversial scholars of prehistoric religion and anthropology  James Harrod and Vincent W  Fallio  have recently proposed that religion and spirituality  and art  may have first arisen in Pre Paleolithic chimpanzees or Early Lower Paleolithic  Oldowan  societies  According to Fallio  the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans experienced altered states of consciousness and partook in ritual  and ritual was used in their societies to strengthen social bonding and group cohesion   Middle Paleolithic humans  use of burials at sites such as Krapina  Croatia  c  130 000 BP  and Qafzeh  Israel  c  100 000 BP  have led some anthropologists and archeologists  such as Philip Lieberman  to believe that Middle Paleolithic humans may have possessed a belief in an afterlife and a  concern for the dead that transcends daily life   Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites  such as Combe Grenal and Abri Moula in France  suggest that the Neanderthals like some contemporary human cultures may have practiced ritual defleshing for  presumably  religious reasons  According to recent archeological findings from H  heidelbergensis sites in Atapuerca  humans may have begun burying their dead much earlier  during the late Lower Paleolithic  but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community   Likewise  some scientists have proposed that Middle Paleolithic societies such as Neanderthal societies may also have practiced the earliest form of totemism or animal worship  in addition to their  presumably religious  burial of the dead  In particular  Emil Bächler suggested  based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves  that a bear cult was widespread among Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals  A claim that evidence was found for Middle Paleolithic animal worship c 70 000 BCE originates from the Tsodilo Hills in the African Kalahari desert has been denied by the original investigators of the site  Animal cults in the following Upper Paleolithic period  such as the bear cult  may have had their origins in these hypothetical Middle Paleolithic animal cults  Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic was intertwined with hunting rites  For instance  archeological evidence from art and bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently involved a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism  in which a bear was sliced with arrows  finished off by a blast in the lungs  and ritualistically worshipped near a clay bear statue covered by a bear fur with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately  Barbara Ehrenreich controversially theorizes that the sacrificial hunting rites of the Upper Paleolithic  and by extension Paleolithic cooperative big game hunting  gave rise to war or warlike raiding during the following Epi Paleolithic Mesolithic or late Upper Paleolithic period   The existence of anthropomorphic images and half human  half animal images in the Upper Paleolithic period may further indicate that Upper Paleolithic humans were the first people to believe in a pantheon of gods or supernatural beings  though such images may instead indicate shamanistic practices similar to those of contemporary tribal societies  The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman  and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices  dates back to the early Upper Paleolithic era  c  30 000 BP  in what is now the Czech Republic  However  during the early Upper Paleolithic it was probably more common for all members of the band to participate equally and fully in religious ceremonies  in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part time ritual specialists such as shamans  priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life  Additionally  it is also possible that Upper Paleolithic religions  like contemporary and historical animistic and polytheistic religions  believed in the existence of a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as animistic spirits   Vincent W  Fallio writes that ancestor cults first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies  He argues that the elites of these societies  like the elites of many more contemporary complex hunter gatherers such as the Tlingit  may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies  by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that also gives them control over the earthly realm  Secret societies may have served a similar function in these complex quasi theocratic societies  by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the separate spheres of Popular Religion and Elite Religion   Religion was possibly apotropaic  specifically  it may have involved sympathetic magic  The Venus figurines  which are abundant in the Upper Paleolithic archeological record  provide an example of possible Paleolithic sympathetic magic  as they may have been used for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women  The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have sometimes been explained as depictions of an earth goddess similar to Gaia  or as representations of a goddess who is the ruler or mother of the animals  James Harrod has described them as representative of female  and male  shamanistic spiritual transformation processes   3 6  Diet and nutrition  Paleolithic hunting and gathering people ate varying proportions of leafy vegetables  fruit  nuts and insects  meat  fish  and shellfish  However  there is little direct evidence of the relative proportions of plant and animal foods  Although the term  paleolithic diet   without references to a specific timeframe or locale  is sometimes used with an implication that most humans shared a certain diet during the entire era  that is not entirely accurate  The Paleolithic was an extended period of time  during which multiple technological advances were made  many of which had impact on human dietary structure  For example  humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the Middle Paleolithic  or tools necessary to engage in extensive fishing  On the other hand  both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans by the end of the Paleolithic  consequently  allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting   In addition  the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations  During the Lower Paleolithic  ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the Great Rift Valley  During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic  humans greatly expanded their area of settlement  reaching ecosystems as diverse as New Guinea and Alaska  and adapting their diets to whatever local resources available   Another view is that until the Upper Paleolithic  humans were frugivores  fruit eaters  who supplemented their meals with carrion  eggs  and small prey such as baby birds and mussels  and only on rare occasions managed to kill and consume big game such as antelopes  This view is supported by studies of higher apes  particularly chimpanzees  Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically  sharing more than 96% of their DNA code with humans  and their digestive tract is functionally very similar to that of humans  Chimpanzees are primarily frugivores  but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh  given the opportunity  In general  their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant based  with the remaining 5% filled with insects  eggs  and baby animals  In some ecosystems  however  chimpanzees are predatory  forming parties to hunt monkeys  Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts of calories from sources such as animal foods  allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead   A difficulty with the frugivore point of view is that humans are established to conditionally require certain long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  LC PUFAs   such as AA and DHA  from the diet  Humans  LC PUFA requirements are much greater than chimpanzees  because of humans  larger brain mass  and humans  abilities to synthesize them from other nutrients are poor  suggesting readily available external sources  Pregnant and lactating females require 100 mg of DHA per day  However  LC PUFAs are almost nonexistent in plants and in most tissues of warm climate animals   Anthropologists have diverse opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed  Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers  there were many varied  diets    in different groups   and also varying through this vast amount of time  Some paleolithic hunter gatherers consumed a significant amount of meat and possibly obtained most of their food from hunting  while others are shown as a primarily plant based diet  Most  if not all  are believed to have been opportunistic omnivores  One hypothesis is that carbohydrate tubers  plant underground storage organs  may have been eaten in high amounts by pre agricultural humans  It is thought that the Paleolithic diet included as much as 1 65–1 9 kilograms per day of fruit and vegetables  The relative proportions of plant and animal foods in the diets of Paleolithic people often varied between regions  with more meat being necessary in colder regions  which weren t populated by anatomically modern humans until 30 000 50 000 BP   It is generally agreed that many modern hunting and fishing tools  such as fish hooks  nets  bows  and poisons  weren t introduced until the Upper Paleolithic and possibly even Neolithic  The only hunting tools widely available to humans during any significant part of the Paleolithic period were hand held spears and harpoons  There s evidence of Paleolithic people killing and eating seals and elands as far as 100 000 years BP  On the other hand  buffalo bones found in African caves from the same period are typically of very young or very old individuals  and there s no evidence that pigs  elephants or rhinos were hunted by humans at the time   Paleolithic peoples suffered less famine and malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them  This was partly because Paleolithic hunter gatherers accessed to a wider variety natural foods  which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine  Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic  and some modern  farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on a small number of crops  It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods  The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists  It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods  with meat likely taking a back seat to plants  It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as Type 2 diabetes  coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease  because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity  and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions   Large seeded legumes were part of the human diet long before the Neolithic agricultural revolution  as evident from archaeobotanical finds from the Mousterian layers of Kebara Cave  in Israel  There is evidence suggesting that Paleolithic societies were gathering wild cereals for food use at least as early as 30 000 years ago  However  seeds  such as grains and beans  were rarely eaten and never in large quantities on a daily basis  Recent archeological evidence also indicates that winemaking may have originated in the Paleolithic  when early humans drank the juice of naturally fermented wild grapes from animal skin pouches  Paleolithic humans consumed animal organ meats  including the livers  kidneys and brains  Upper Paleolithic cultures appear to have had significant knowledge about plants and herbs and may have  albeit very rarely  practiced rudimentary forms of horticulture  In particular  bananas and tubers may have been cultivated as early as 25 000 BP in southeast Asia  Late Upper Paleolithic societies also appear to have occasionally practiced pastoralism and animal husbandry  presumably for dietary reasons  For instance  some European late Upper Paleolithic cultures domesticated and raised reindeer  presumably for their meat or milk  as early as 14 000 BP  Humans also probably consumed hallucinogenic plants during the Paleolithic period  The Australian Aborigines have been consuming a variety of native animal and plant foods  called bushfood  for an estimated 60 000 years  since the Middle Paleolithic   People during the Middle Paleolithic  such as the Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa  began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110 000 years ago and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens sites at Pinnacle Point  in Africa around 164 000 BP  Although fishing only became common during the Upper Paleolithic  fish have been part of human diets long before the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic  For example  the Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large  long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90 000 years ago  The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi nomadic  which altered their social structures  Example societies are the Lepenski Vir as well as some contemporary hunter gatherers such as the Tlingit  In some instances  at least the Tlingit  they developed social stratification  slavery and complex social structures such as chiefdoms   Anthropologists such as Tim White suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic  based on the large amount of “butchered human  bones found in Neanderthal and other Lower Middle Paleolithic sites  Cannibalism in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages  However  it may have been for religious reasons  and would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the Upper Paleolithic  Nonetheless  it remains possible that Paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism  and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of ritual post mortem bone cleaning or predation by carnivores such as saber tooth cats  lions and hyenas   4  Events  By 11 000 BCE   Paleo Indians reach the Tierra del Fuego   5  See also  Abbassia Pluvial  Caveman  Japanese Paleolithic  Lascaux
