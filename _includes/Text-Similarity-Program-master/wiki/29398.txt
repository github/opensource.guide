A single stage to orbit  or SSTO  vehicle reaches orbit from the surface of a body without jettisoning hardware  expending only propellants and fluids  The term usually  but not exclusively  refers to reusable vehicles  No Earth launched SSTO launch vehicles have ever been constructed  To date  orbital launches have been performed either by multi stage fully or partially expendable rockets  or by the Space Shuttle which was multi stage and partially reusable   Launch costs for Low Earth Orbit  LEO  range from $4500 to $8500 per pound of payload  Reusable SSTO vehicles offer the promise of reduced launch expenses by eliminating recurring costs associated with hardware replacement inherent in expendable launch systems  However  the nonrecurring costs associated with design  development  research and engineering  DDR&E  of reusable SSTO systems are much higher than expendable systems due to the substantial technical challenges of SSTO   It is considered to be marginally possible to launch a single stage to orbit spacecraft from Earth  The principal complicating factors for SSTO from Earth are  high orbital velocity of over the need to overcome the earth s gravity  especially in the early stages of flight  and flight within the Earth s atmosphere  which limits speed in the early stages of flight and influences engine performance  The marginality of SSTO can be seen in the launch of the space shuttle  The shuttle and main tank combination successfully orbits after booster separation from an altitude of and a speed of   This is approximately 12% of the gravitational potential energy and just 3% of the kinetic energy needed for orbital velocity  4% of total energy required    Notable single stage to orbit research spacecraft include Skylon  the DC X  the X 33  and the Roton SSTO  However  despite showing some promise  none of them has come close to achieving orbit yet due to problems with finding the most efficient propulsion system   Single stage to orbit has been achieved from the Moon by both the Apollo program s Lunar Module and several robotic spacecraft of the Soviet Luna program  the lower lunar gravity and absence of any significant atmosphere makes this much easier than from Earth   1  History  Early rocket pioneers believed that single stage to orbit was impossible   In the 1960s some people  Ex  Philip Bono  began to investigate SSTOs   From 1965 Robert Salked investigated various single stage to orbit spaceplane concepts   Around 1985 the NASP project was intended to create a scramjet vehicle to reach orbit  but this had its funding stopped and was cancelled   The HOTOL tried to use precooled jet engine technology  but failed to show significant advantages over rocket technology   Around 1992 the Skylon spaceplane concept was created   1999 2001 Rotary Rocket attempted to build a SSTO called the Roton   2  Approaches  There have been various approaches to SSTO  including pure rockets that are launched and land vertically  air breathing scramjet powered vehicles that are launched and land horizontally  nuclear powered vehicles  and even jet engine powered vehicles that can fly into orbit and return landing like an airliner  completely intact   For rocket powered SSTO  the main challenge is achieving a high enough mass ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit  plus a meaningful payload weight  One possibility is to give the rocket an initial speed with a space gun  as planned in the Quicklaunch project   For air breathing SSTO  the main challenge is system complexity and associated research and development costs  material science  and construction techniques necessary for surviving sustained high speed flight within the atmosphere  and achieving a high enough mass ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit  plus a meaningful payload weight  Air breathing designs typically fly at supersonic or hypersonic speeds  and usually include a rocket engine for the final burn for orbit   Whether rocket powered or air breathing  a reusable vehicle must be rugged enough to survive multiple round trips into space without adding excessive weight or maintenance  In addition a reusable vehicle must be able to reenter without damage  and land safely   While single stage rockets were once thought to be beyond reach  advances in materials technology and construction techniques have shown them to be possible  For example  calculations show that the Titan II first stage  launched on its own  would have a 25 to 1 ratio of fuel to vehicle hardware  It has a sufficiently efficient engine to achieve orbit  but without carrying much payload   3  Design challenges inherent in SSTO  The design space constraints of SSTO vehicles were described by rocket design engineer Robert Truax   The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation expresses the maximum change in velocity any single rocket stage can achieve   where   The mass ratio of a vehicle is defined as a ratio the initial vehicle mass when fully loaded with propellants to the final vehicle mass after the burn   where   The propellant mass fraction    of a vehicle can be expressed solely as a function of the mass ratio   The structural coefficient    is a critical parameter in SSTO vehicle design  Structural efficiency of a vehicle is maximized as the structural coefficient approaches zero  The structural coefficient is defined as   The overall structural mass fraction can be expressed in terms of the structural coefficient   An additional expression for the overall structural mass fraction can be found by noting that the payload mass fraction   propellant mass fraction and structural mass fraction sum to one   Equating the expressions for structural mass fraction and solving for the initial vehicle mass yields   This expression shows how the size of a SSTO vehicle is dependent on its structural efficiency  Given a mission profile and propellant type  the size of a vehicle increases with an increasing structural coefficient  This growth factor sensitivity is shown parametrically for both SSTO and two stage to orbit  TSTO  vehicles for a standard LEO mission  The curves vertically asymptote at the maximum structural coefficient limit where mission criteria can no longer be met   In comparison to a non optimized TSTO vehicle using restricted staging  a SSTO rocket launching an identical payload mass and using the same propellants will always require a substantially smaller structural coefficient to achieve the same Delta v  Given that current materials technology places a lower limit of approximately 0 1 on the smallest structural coefficients attainable  reusable SSTO vehicles are typically an impractical choice even when using the highest performance propellants available   4  Dense versus hydrogen fuels  Hydrogen might seem the obvious fuel for SSTO vehicles  When burned with oxygen  hydrogen gives the highest specific impulse of any commonly used fuel  around 450 seconds  compared with up to 350 seconds for kerosene   Hydrogen has the following advantages   Hydrogen has nearly 30% higher specific impulse  about 450 seconds vs  350 seconds  than most dense fuels   Hydrogen is an excellent coolant   The gross mass of hydrogen stages is lower than dense fuelled stages for the same payload   Hydrogen is environmentally friendly  However  hydrogen also has these disadvantages   Very low density  about 1 7 of the density of kerosene  — requiring a very large tank  Deeply cryogenic — must be stored at very low temperatures and thus needs heavy insulation  Escapes very easily from the smallest gap  Wide combustible range — easily ignited and burns with a dangerously invisible flame  Tends to condense oxygen which can cause flammability problems  Has a large coefficient of expansion for even small heat leaks  These issues can be dealt with  but at extra cost   While kerosene tanks can be 1% of the weight of their contents  hydrogen tanks often must weigh 10% of their contents  This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff  a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels   The low density of hydrogen further affects the design of the rest of the vehicle — pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine  The end result is the thrust weight ratio of hydrogen fueled engines is 30–50% lower than comparable engines using denser fuels   This inefficiency indirectly affects gravity losses as well  the vehicle has to hold itself up on rocket power until it reaches orbit  The lower excess thrust of the hydrogen engines due to the lower thrust weight ratio means that the vehicle must ascend more steeply  and so less thrust acts horizontally  Less horizontal thrust results in taking longer to reach orbit  and gravity losses are increased by at least   While not appearing large  the mass ratio to delta v curve is very steep to reach orbit in a single stage  and this makes a 10% difference to the mass ratio on top of the tankage and pump savings   The overall effect is that there is surprisingly little difference in overall performance between SSTOs that use hydrogen and those that use denser fuels  except that hydrogen vehicles may be rather more expensive to develop and buy  Careful studies have shown that some dense fuels  for example liquid propane  exceed the performance of hydrogen fuel when used in an SSTO launch vehicle by 10% for the same dry weight   In the 1960s Philip Bono investigated single stage  VTVL tripropellant rockets  and showed that it could improve payload size by around 30%   Operational experience with the DC X experimental rocket has caused a number of SSTO advocates to reconsider hydrogen as a satisfactory fuel  The late Max Hunter  while employing hydrogen fuel in the DC X  often said that he thought the first successful orbital SSTO would more likely be fueled by propane   5  One engine for all altitudes  Some SSTO vehicles use the same engine for all altitudes  which is a problem for traditional engines with a bell shaped nozzle  Depending on the atmospheric pressure  different bell shapes are optimal  Engines operating in the lower atmosphere have shorter bells than those designed to work in vacuum  Having a bell not optimized for the height makes the engine less efficient   One possible solution would be to use an aerospike engine  which can be effective in a wide range of ambient pressures  In fact  a linear aerospike engine was used in the X 33 design   Other solutions involve using multiple engines and other altitude adapting designs such as double mu bells or extensible bell sections   Still  at very high altitudes  the extremely large engine bells tend to expand the exhaust gases down to near vacuum pressures  As a result  these engine bells are counterproductive due to their excess weight  Some SSTO vehicles simply use very high pressure engines which permit high ratios to be used from ground level  This gives good performance  negating the need for more complex solutions   6  Airbreathing SSTO  Some designs for SSTO attempt to use airbreathing jet engines that collect oxidizer and reaction mass from the atmosphere to reduce the take off weight of the vehicle   Some of the issues with this approach are   No known air breathing engine is capable of operating at orbital speed within the atmosphere  for example hydrogen fueled scramjets seem to have a top speed of about Mach 17   This means that rockets must be used for the final orbital insertion   Rocket thrust needs the orbital mass to be as small as possible to minimize propellant weight   The thrust to weight ratio of rockets that rely on on board oxygen increases dramatically as fuel is expended  because the oxidizer fuel tank has about 1% of the mass as the oxidizer it carries  whereas air breathing engines traditionally have a poor thrust weight ratio which is relatively fixed during the air breathing ascent   Very high speeds in the atmosphere necessitate very heavy thermal protection systems  which makes reaching orbit even harder   While at lower speeds  air breathing engines are very efficient  the efficiency  Isp  and thrust levels of air breathing jet engines drop considerably at high speed  above Mach 5–10 depending on the engine  and begin to approach that of rocket engines or worse   Lift to drag ratios of vehicles at hypersonic speeds are poor whereas since acceleration is a vector  the effective lift to drag ratios of rocket vehicles at high g is not dissimilar  Thus with for example scramjet designs  e g  X 43  the mass budgets do not seem to close for orbital launch   Similar issues occur with single stage vehicles attempting to carry conventional jet engines to orbit  the weight of the jet engines is not compensated by the reduction in propellant sufficiently   On the other hand LACE like precooled airbreathing designs such as the Skylon spaceplane  and ATREX  which transition to rocket thrust at rather lower speeds  Mach 5 5  do seem to give  on paper at least  an improved orbital mass fraction over pure rockets  even multistage rockets  sufficiently to hold out the possibility of full reusability with better payload fraction   It is important to note that mass fraction is an important concept in the engineering of a rocket  However  mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket  as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole  As a result  a cheap rocket with a poor mass fraction may be able to deliver more payload to orbit with a given amount of money than a more complicated  more efficient rocket   7  Launch assists  Many vehicles are only narrowly suborbital  so practically anything that gives a relatively small delta v increase can be helpful  and outside assistance for a vehicle is therefore desirable   Proposed launch assists include   sled launch  rail  maglev including Bantam  MagLifter  and StarTram  etc    aircraft tow  in flight fueling  Lofstrom launch loop space fountains And on orbit resources such as   Space tether  tugs  8  Nuclear propulsion  Due to weight issues such as shielding  many nuclear propulsion systems are unable to lift their own weight  and hence are unsuitable for launching to orbit  However some designs such as the Orion project and some nuclear thermal designs do have a thrust to weight ratio in excess of 1  enabling them to lift off  Clearly one of the main issues with nuclear propulsion would be safety  both during a launch for the passengers  but also in case of a failure during launch  No current program is attempting nuclear propulsion from Earth s surface   9  Beam powered propulsion  Because they can be more energetic than the potential energy that chemical fuel allows for  some laser or microwave powered rocket concepts have the potential to launch vehicles into orbit  single stage  In practice  this area is relatively undeveloped  and current technology falls far short of this   10  Comparison with the Shuttle  The high cost per launch of the Space Shuttle sparked interest throughout the 1980s in designing a cheaper successor vehicle  Several official design studies were done  but most were basically smaller versions of the existing Shuttle concept   Most cost analysis studies of the Space Shuttle have shown that workforce is by far the single greatest expense  Early shuttle discussions speculated airliner type operation  with a two week turnaround  However  senior NASA planners envisioned no more than 10 to 12 flights per year for the entire shuttle fleet  The absolute maximum flights per year for the entire fleet was limited by external tank manufacturing capacity to 24 per year   Very efficient  hence complex and sophisticated  main engines were required to fit within the available vehicle space  Likewise the only known suitable lightweight thermal protection was delicate  maintenance intensive silica tiles  These and other design decisions resulted in a vehicle that requires great maintenance after every mission  The engines are removed and inspected  and prior to the new  block II  main engines  the turbopumps were removed  disassembled and rebuilt  While Space Shuttle Atlantis was refurbished and relaunched in 53 days between missions STS 51 J and STS 61 B  generally months were required to repair an orbiter for a new mission   Many in the aerospace community concluded that an entirely self contained  reusable single stage vehicle could solve these problems  The idea behind such a vehicle is to reduce the processing requirements from those of the Shuttle   11  Examples  It is easier to achieve SSTO from a body with lower gravitational pull than Earth  such as the Moon or Mars  The Apollo Lunar Module achieved deorbit to a soft landing  and return to lunar orbit  each with a single stage for descent and ascent   A detailed study into SSTO vehicles was prepared by Chrysler Corporation s Space Division in 1970–1971 under NASA contract NAS8 26341  Their proposal  Shuttle SERV  was an enormous vehicle with more than of payload  utilizing jet engines for  vertical  landing  While the technical problems seemed to be solvable  the USAF required a winged design that led to the Shuttle as we know it today   The unmanned DC X technology demonstrator  originally developed by McDonnell Douglas for the Strategic Defense Initiative  SDI  program office  was an attempt to build a vehicle that could lead to an SSTO vehicle  The one third size test craft was operated and maintained by a small team of three people based out of a trailer  and the craft was once relaunched less than 24 hours after landing  Although the test program was not without mishap  including a minor explosion   the DC X demonstrated that the maintenance aspects of the concept were sound  That project was cancelled when it crashed on the fourth flight after transferring management from the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization to NASA   The Aquarius Launch Vehicle was designed to bring bulk materials to orbit as cheaply as possible   12  Current development  Current private SSTO projects include the Japanese Kankoh maru project and the Skylon   12 1  Skylon  The British Government partnered with the ESA in 2010 to promote a single stage to orbit spaceplane concept called Skylon  This design was pioneered by Reaction Engines Limited  REL   a company founded by Alan Bond after HOTOL was canceled  The Skylon spaceplane has been positively received by the British government  and the British Interplanetary Society  Following a successful propulsion system test that was audited by ESA s propulsion division in mid 2012  REL announced that it would begin a three and a half year project to develop and build a test jig of the Sabre engine to prove the engines performance across its air breathing and rocket modes  In November 2012  it was announced that a key test of the engine precooler had been successfully completed  and that ESA had verified the precooler s design  The project s development is now allowed to advance to its next phase  which involves the construction and testing of a full scale prototype engine   12 2  Haas 2C  On 1 June 2012  Romanian organization ARCA announced that they are constructing an expendable rocket  named Haas 2C that will attempt to reach orbit in one stage  The rocket has empty weight and can carry 15 5 tons of fuel  It will use kerosene as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidizer  In Spring 2012 they have successfully tested a lightweight composite kerosene fuel tank  The liquid oxygen tank is being designed and it will also be made of composite materials  The launch is expected to take place in Spring 2013   13  Alternative approaches to inexpensive spaceflight  Many studies have shown that regardless of selected technology  the most effective cost reduction technique is economies of scale  Merely launching a large total quantity reduces the manufacturing costs per vehicle  similar to how the mass production of automobiles brought about great increases in affordability   Using this concept  some aerospace analysts believe the way to lower launch costs is the exact opposite of SSTO  Whereas reusable SSTOs would reduce per launch costs by making a reusable high tech vehicle that launches frequently with low maintenance  the  mass production  approach views the technical advances as a source of the cost problem in the first place  By simply building and launching large quantities of rockets  and hence launching a large volume of payload  costs can be brought down  This approach was attempted in the late 1970s  early 1980s in West Germany with the Democratic Republic of the Congo based OTRAG rocket   A related idea is to obtain economies of scale from building simple  massive  multi stage rockets using cheap  off the shelf parts  The vehicles would be dumped into the ocean after use  This strategy is known as the  big dumb booster  approach   This is somewhat similar to the approach some previous systems have taken  using simple engine systems with  low tech  fuels  as the Russian and Chinese space programs still do  These nations  launches are significantly cheaper than their Western counterparts   An alternative to scale is to make the discarded stages practically reusable  this is the goal of the SpaceX reusable launch system development program and its Grasshopper demonstrator
