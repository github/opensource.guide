Pegasus    Pégasos  Latin  Pegasus  is one of the best known creatures in Greek mythology  He is a winged divine stallion usually depicted as pure white in color  He was sired by Poseidon  in his role as horse god  and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa  He was the brother of Chrysaor  born at a single birthing when his mother was decapitated by Perseus  Greco Roman poets write about his ascent to heaven after his birth and his obeisance to Zeus  king of the gods  who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus  Friend of the Muses  Pegasus is the creator of Hippocrene  the fountain on Mt  Helicon  He was captured by the Greek hero Bellerophon near the fountain Peirene with the help of Athena and Poseidon  Pegasus allows the hero to ride him to defeat a monster  the Chimera  before realizing many other exploits  His rider  however  falls off his back trying to reach Mount Olympus  Zeus transformed him into the constellation Pegasus and placed him up in the sky   Hypotheses have been proposed regarding its relationship with the Muses  the gods Athena  Poseidon  Zeus  Apollo  and the hero Perseus   The symbolism of Pegasus varies with time  Symbol of wisdom and especially of fame from the Middle Ages until the Renaissance  he became one symbol of the poetry and the creator of sources in which the poets come to draw inspiration  particularly in the 19th century  Pegasus is the subject of a very rich iconography  especially through the ancient Greek pottery and paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance   1  Etymology  The poet Hesiod presents a folk etymology of the name Pegasus as derived from πηγή pēgē  spring  well    the pegai of Okeanos  where he was born    A proposed etymology of the name is Luwian pihassas  meaning  lightning   and Pihassassi  a local Luwian Hittite name in southern Cilicia of a weather god represented with thunder and lightning  The proponents of this etymology adduce Pegasus  role  reported as early as Hesiod  as bringer of thunderbolts to Zeus  It was first suggested in 1952 and remains widely accepted  but Robin Lane Fox  2009  has criticized it as implausible   2  Pegasus and springs  According to legend  everywhere the winged horse struck his hoof to the earth  an inspiring spring burst forth  One of these springs was upon the Muses  Mount Helicon  the Hippocrene   horse spring    opened  Antoninus Liberalis suggested  at the behest of Poseidon to prevent the mountain swelling with rapture at the song of the Muses  another was at Troezen  Hesiod relates how Pegasus was peacefully drinking from a spring when the hero Bellerophon captured him  Hesiod also says Pegasus carried thunderbolts for Zeus   3  Birth  There are several versions of the birth of the winged stallion and his brother Chrysaor in the far distant place at the edge of Earth  Hesiod s  springs of Oceanus  which encircles the inhabited earth  where Perseus found Medusa   One is that they sprang from the blood issuing from Medusa s neck as Perseus was beheading her  similar to the manner in which Athena was born from the head of Zeus  In another version  when Perseus beheaded Medusa  they were born of the Earth  fed by the Gorgon s blood  A variation of this story holds that they were formed from the mingling of Medusa s blood  pain and sea foam  implying that Poseidon had involvement in their making  The last version bears resemblance to the birth of Aphrodite  daughter of Zeus   4  Bellerophon  Pegasus aided the hero Bellerophon in his fight against both the Chimera and the Amazons  There are varying tales as to how Bellerophon found Pegasus  the most common says that the hero was told by Polyeidos to sleep in the temple of Athena  where the goddess visited him in the night and presented him with a golden bridle  The next morning  still clutching the bridle  he found Pegasus drinking at the Pierian spring and caught Pegasus  and eventually tamed him   5  Perseus  Michaud s Biographie universelle relates that when Pegasus was born  he flew to where thunder and lightning are released  Then  according to certain versions of the myth  Athena tamed him and gave him to Perseus  who flew to Ethiopia to help Andromeda   In fact Pegasus is a late addition to the story of Perseus  who flew on his own with the sandals loaned him by Hermes   6  Olympus  Pegasus and Athena left Bellerophon and continued to Olympus where he was stabled with Zeus  other steeds  and was given the task of carrying Zeus  thunderbolts  Because of his faithful service to Zeus  he was honored with transformation into a constellation  On the day of his catasterism  when Zeus transformed him into a constellation  a single feather fell to the earth near the city of Tarsus   7  Legacy  7 1  World War II  During

background  The insignia was designed by famous English novelist Daphne du Maurier  who was married to the commander of the 1st Airborne Division  and later the expanded British Airborne Forces

carries on the maroon beret tradition   During the airborne phase of the Normandy invasion on the night of 5–6 June 1944  British 6th Airborne Division captured all its key objectives in advance of
