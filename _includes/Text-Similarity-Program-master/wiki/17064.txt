The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae  macropods  meaning  large foot    In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family  especially those of the genus Macropus  red kangaroo  antilopine kangaroo  eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo  Kangaroos are endemic to Australia  and one genus  the tree kangaroo  is also found in Papua New Guinea  The Australian government estimates that 34 3 million kangaroos lived in Australia in 2011  up from 25 1 million one year earlier   Kangaroos have large  powerful hind legs  large feet adapted for leaping  a long muscular tail for balance  and a small head  Like most marsupials  female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development   Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans  Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered  whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful   The kangaroo is an unofficial symbol of Australia and appears as an emblem on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency and is used by some of Australia s well known organisations  including Qantas and the Royal Australian Air Force  The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image  and consequently there are numerous popular culture references   Wild kangaroos are shot for meat  leather hides  and to protect grazing land  Although controversial  harvesting kangaroo meat has some environmental advantages to limit over grazing and the meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos   1  Terminology  The word  kangaroo  derives from the Guugu Yimithirr word gangurru  referring to grey kangaroos  The name was first recorded as  kanguru  on 12 July 1770 in an entry in the diary of Sir Joseph Banks  this occurred at the site of modern Cooktown  on the banks of the Endeavour River  where HMS Endeavour under the command of Lieutenant James Cook was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef  Cook first referred to kangaroos in his diary entry of 4 August  Guugu Yimithirr is the language of the people of the area   A common myth about the kangaroo s English name is that  kangaroo  was a Guugu Yimithirr phrase for  I don t understand you   According to this legend  Cook and Banks were exploring the area when they happened upon the animal  They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called  The local responded  Kangaroo   meaning  I don t understand you   which Cook took to be the name of the creature  This myth was debunked in the 1970s by linguist John B  Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people   Kangaroos are often colloquially referred to as  roos   Male kangaroos are called bucks  boomers  jacks  or old men  females are does  flyers  or jills  and the young ones are joeys  The collective noun for kangaroos is a mob  troop  or court   2  Taxonomy and description  There are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos   The red kangaroo  Macropus rufus  is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world  The Red Kangaroo occupies the arid and semi arid centre of the country  The highest population densities of the Red Kangaroo occur in the rangelands of western New South Wales  Red kangaroos are commonly mistaken as the most abundant species of kangaroo  but eastern greys actually have a larger population  A large male can be 2 metres  6 ft 7 in  tall and weigh 90 kg  200 lb    The eastern grey kangaroo  Macropus giganteus  is less well known than the red  outside Australia   but the most often seen  as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the country  The range of the Eastern Grey Kangaroo extends from the top of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland down to Victoria  as well as areas of south eastern Australia and Tasmania  Population densities of Eastern Grey Kangaroos usually peak near 100 per km2 in suitable habitats of open woodlands  Populations are more limited in areas of land clearance  such as farmland  where forest and woodland habitats are limited in size or abundance   The western grey kangaroo  Macropus fuliginosus  is slightly smaller again at about 54 kg  119 lb  for a large male  It is found in the southern part of Western Australia  South Australia near the coast  and the Darling River basin  The highest population densities occur in the western Riverina district of New South Wales and in western areas of the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia  Populations may have declined  particularly in agricultural areas  The species has a high tolerance to the plant toxin sodium fluoroacetate  which indicates a possible origin from the south west region of Australia   The antilopine kangaroo  Macropus antilopinus  is  essentially  the far northern equivalent of the eastern and western grey kangaroos  It is sometimes referred to as the ‘Antilopine Wallaroo ’ but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to Red and grey kangaroos  Like them  it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands  and gregarious  Their name comes from their fur  which is similar in colour and texture to that of antelopes  Characteristically  the noses of males swell behind the nostrils  This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates  In addition  there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroo in the family Macropodidae  Kangaroos and other macropods share a common ancestor with Phalangeridae from the mid Miocene  This ancestor was likely arboreal and lived in the canopies of the extensive forests that covered most of Australia at that time  when the climate was much wetter  and fed on leaves and stems  From the late Miocene though the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene the climate got drier which lead to a decline of forests and expansion of grasslands  At this time there was a radiation of macropodids characterised by enlarged body size and adaptation to the low quality grass diet with the development of foregut fermentation  The most numerous early macropods  the Balbaridae and Bulungmayinae  went extinct in the late Miocene around 5–10 mya  There is dispute over the relationships of the two groups to modern kangaroos and rat kangaroos  Some argue that the balbarines were the ancestors of rat kangaroos and the bulungmayines were the ancestors of kangaroos  while others hold the contrary view  The middle to late bulungmayines  Gungaroo and Wanburoo lacked digit 1 of the hind foot and digits 2 and 3 were reduced and partly under the large digit 4  much like the modern kangaroo foot  This would indicate that they were bipedal  In addition their ankle bones had an articulation that would have prohibited much lateral movements  an adaptation for bipedal hopping  Species related to the modern grey kangaroos and wallaroos begin to appear in the Pliocene  The red kangaroo appears to be the most recently evolved kangaroo with its fossil record not going back beyond the Pleistocene period  1–2 mya   Europeans have long regarded kangaroos as strange animals  Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer  without antlers   stood upright like men  and hopped like frogs  Combined with the two headed appearance of a mother kangaroo  this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers  tales for quite some time  The first kangaroo to be exhibited in the western world was an example shot by John Gore  an officer on Captain Cook s Endeavour in 1770  The animal was shot and its skin and skull transported back to England whereupon it was stuffed  by taxidermists who had never seen the animal before  and displayed to the general public as a curiosity  The first glimpse of a kangaroo for many 18th century Britons was a painting by George Stubbs   2 1  Kangaroos compared with wallabies  Kangaroos and wallabies belong to the same taxonomic family  Macropodidae  and often the same genera  but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the six largest species of the family  The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise   3  Biology and behaviour  3 1  Locomotion  Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion  The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km h  13–16 mph   but speeds of up to 70 km h  44 mph  can be attained over short distances  while it can sustain a speed of 40 km h  25 mph  for nearly   This fast and energy efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water  rather than the need to escape predators  At slow speeds  it employs pentapedal locomotion  using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward  Kangaroos are adept swimmers  and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator  If pursued into the water  a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it   3 2  Diet  Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep  They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten  chew it as cud  and then swallow it again for final digestion  Different species of kangaroos have different diets  although all are strict herbivores  The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer  eating a wide variety of grasses  whereas some other species  e g  the red kangaroo  include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets  The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi  Many species are nocturnal  and crepuscular  usually spending the days resting in shade  and the cool evenings  nights and mornings moving about and feeding   Because of its grazing  kangaroos have developed specialised teeth  Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground  and its molars chop and grind the grass  Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together  the lower incisors are farther apart  giving the kangaroo a wider bite  The silica in grass is abrasive  so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down  and eventually fall out  replaced by new teeth that grow in the back  This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals  only occurs in elephants and manatees   3 2 1  Absence of digestive methane release  Despite having herbivorous diets similar to ruminants such as cattle  which release large quantities of methane through exhaling and eructation  burping   kangaroos release virtually none  The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate  which is then used to provide further energy  Scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle  since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide  per molecule   3 3  Social and sexual behaviour  Groups of kangaroos are called mobs  Mobs usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them  Living in mobs provides protection for some of the weaker members of the group  The size and stability of the mobs vary between geographic regions  with eastern Australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west  Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures  comparable to that of ungulates  One common behaviour is nose touching and sniffing  which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group  The kangaroos performing the sniffing gain much information from smell cues  This behaviour enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression  During mutual sniffing  if one kangaroo is smaller  it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver  this is possibly a form of submission  Greetings between males and females are common  with larger males being the most involved in meeting females  Most other non antagonistic behaviour occurs between mothers and their young  Mother and young reinforce their bond though grooming  A mother will groom her young during or after it is suckling  A joey will nuzzle its mother’s pouch if it wants access to it   Sexual activity of kangaroos consists of consort pairs  Oestrous females roam widely and attract the attention of males with conspicuous signals  A male will monitor a female and follow her every movement  He sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus  a process exhibiting the flehmen response  The male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her  If the female does not run away  the male will continue by licking  pawing  and scratching her  and copulation will follow  After copulation is over  the male will move on to another female  Consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long  Thus  a consort pair is likely to attract the attention of a rival male  As larger males are in tending bonds with females near oestrus  smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus  Dominant males can avoid having to sort through females to determine their reproductive status by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight  Fighting has been described in all species of kangaroos  Fights between kangaroos can be brief or long and ritualised  In highly competitive situations such as males fighting for access to oestrous females or at limited drinking spots  the fights are brief  Both sexes will fight for drinking spots  but long  ritualised fighting or  boxing  is largely done by males  Smaller males fight more often near females in oestrus  while the large males in consorts do not seem to get involved  Ritualised fights can arise suddenly when males are grazing together  However  most fights are preceded by two males scratching and grooming each other  One or both of them will adopt a high standing posture  with one male issuing a challenge by grasping the other male’s neck with its forepaw  Sometimes  the challenge will be declined  Large males often reject challenges by smaller males  During fighting  the combatants adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other s heads  shoulders and chests  They will also lock forearms and wrestle and push each other as well as balance on their tails to kick each other in the abdomens   Brief fights are similar except there is no forearm locking  The losing combatant seems to use kicking more often  perhaps to parry the thrusts of the eventual winner  Winners are decided when a kangaroo breaks off the fight and retreats  Winners are able to push their opponents backwards or down to the ground  They also seem to grasp their opponents when they break contact and push them away  The initiators of the fights are usually the winners  These fights may serve to establish dominance hierarchies among males  as winners of fights have been seen to displace their opponent from resting sites later in the day  Dominant males may also pull grass to intimidate subordinates   3 4  Predators  Kangaroos have few natural predators  The thylacine  considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo  is now extinct  Other extinct predators included the marsupial lion  Megalania and the Wonambi  However  with the arrival of humans in Australia at least 50 000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5 000 years ago  kangaroos have had to adapt  Wedge tailed eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion  Goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking   Along with dingos  introduced species such as foxes  feral cats  and both domestic and feral dogs  pose a threat to kangaroo populations  Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers  and often flee into waterways if presented with the option  If pursued into the water  a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it  Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs   3 5  Adaptations  Kangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry  infertile country and highly variable climate  As with all marsupials  the young are born at a very early stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days  At this stage  only the forelimbs are somewhat developed  to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat  In comparison  a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old  and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive  When the joey is born  it is about the size of a lima bean  The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months  180–320 days for the Western Grey  before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time  It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months   The female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence  except on the day she gives birth  however  she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch  This is known as diapause  and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources  The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey  In addition  the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch   Unusually  during a dry period  males will not produce sperm  and females will only conceive if enough rain has fallen to produce a large quantity of green vegetation   Kangaroos and wallabies have large  elastic tendons in their hind legs  They store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs  providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort  This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeletons through elastic elements such as tendons  but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos   There is also a link between the hopping action and breathing  as the feet leave the ground  air is expelled from the lungs  bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs  providing further energy efficiency  Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated  beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all  increased speed requires very little extra effort  much less than the same speed increase in  say  a horse  dog or human   and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight  For kangaroos  the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped  and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy  in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns  the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival   New research has revealed that a kangaroos tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut  Kangaroos have a unique three stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first  then push off their tail  followed lastly by the back legs  The propulsive force of the tail is equal to that of both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed   A DNA sequencing project of the genome of a member of the kangaroo family  the tammar wallaby  was started in 2004  It was a collaboration between Australia  mainly funded by the state of Victoria  and the National Institutes of Health in the US  The tammar s genome was fully sequenced in 2011  The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics  because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans  mice are too close and have not developed many different functions  while birds are genetically too remote  The dairy industry has also expressed some interest in this project   3 6  Blindness  Eye disease is rare but not new among kangaroos  The first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994  in central New South Wales  The following year  reports of blind kangaroos appeared in Victoria and South Australia  By 1996  the disease had spread  across the desert to Western Australia   Australian authorities were concerned the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans  Researchers at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong detected a virus called the Wallal virus in two species of midges  believed to have been the carriers  Veterinarians also discovered less than 3% of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness   3 7  Reproduction and life cycle  Kangaroo reproduction is similar to that of opossums  The egg  still contained in the evolutionary remnant of a shell  a few micrometres thick  and with only a small quantity of yolk within it  descends from the ovary into the uterus  There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate  Even in the largest kangaroo  the red kangaroo  the neonate emerges after only 33 days  Usually  only one young is born at a time  It is blind  hairless  and only a few centimetres long  its hindlegs are mere stumps  it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother s abdomen into the pouch  which takes about three to five minutes  Once in the pouch  it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed  Almost immediately  the mother s sexual cycle starts again  Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive  Then  if she mates and a second egg is fertilised  its development is temporarily halted  Meanwhile  the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly  After about 190 days  the baby  joey  is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch  after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge  From then on  it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually  after about 235 days  it leaves the pouch for the last time  The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity  varying by species  Most individuals  however  do not reach maturity in the wild   4  Interaction with humans  The kangaroo has always been a very important animal for Australian Aborigines  for its meat  hide  bone and tendon  Kangaroo hides were also sometimes used for recreation  in particular there are accounts of some tribes  Kurnai  using stuffed kangaroo scrotum as a ball for the traditional football game of marngrook  In addition  there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo  Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory   Unlike many of the smaller macropods  kangaroos have fared well since European settlement  European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing  added stock watering points in arid areas  and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes   Kangaroos are shy and retiring by nature  and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans  In 2003  Lulu  an Eastern Grey which had been hand reared  saved a farmer s life by alerting family members to his location when he was injured by a falling tree branch  She received the RSPCA Australia National Animal Valour Award on 19 May 2004   There are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation  however  several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies like disease possibly affecting the marsupials  The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales  in 1936  A hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray  Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger  In July 2011 a male red kangaroo attacked a 94 year old woman in her own backyard as well as her son and 2 police officers responding to the situation  The kangaroo was capsicum sprayed  pepper sprayed  and later put down after the attack   4 1  Conflict with vehicles  A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo  Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of cars  Since kangaroos in mid bound can reach speeds of around 50 km h  31 mph  and are relatively heavy  the force of impact can be severe  Small vehicles may be destroyed  while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage  The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact  As a result   kangaroo crossing  signs are commonplace in Australia   Vehicles that frequent isolated roads  where roadside assistance may be scarce  are often fitted with  roo bars  to minimise damage caused by collision  Bonnet mounted devices  designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods  have been devised and marketed   If a female is the victim of a collision  animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey  in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation  Likewise  when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision  a vet  the RSPCA Australia or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care  In New South Wales  rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from WIRES  Council road signs often list phone numbers for callers to report injured animals   5  Emblems and popular culture  The kangaroo is a recognisable symbol of Australia  The kangaroo and emu feature on the Australian Coat of Arms  Kangaroos have also been featured on coins  most notably the five kangaroos on the Australian one dollar coin  The Australian Made logo consists of a golden kangaroo in a green triangle to show that a product is grown or made in Australia   The kangaroo and wallaby feature predominantly in Australian sports teams names and mascots  Examples include the Australian national rugby league team  the Kangaroos  and the Australian national rugby union team  the Wallabies   Australia’s national airline  Qantas  uses a bounding kangaroo for its logo   Kangaroos are well represented in films  television  books  toys and souvenirs around the world  Skippy the Bush Kangaroo was the star of the popular 1960s Australian children’s television series of the same name  Kangaroos are featured in the Rolf Harris song Tie Me Kangaroo Down  Sport and several Christmas carols   6  Meat  Historically  the kangaroo has been a source of food for indigenous Australians  Kangaroo meat is high in protein and low in fat  about 2%   Kangaroo meat has a high concentration of conjugated linoleic acid  CLA  compared with other foods  and is a rich source of vitamins and minerals  Low fat diets rich in CLA have been studied for their potential in reducing obesity and atherosclerosis   Most kangaroo meat is currently sourced from wild animals as a byproduct of population control programs  Kangaroos are hunted by licensed shooters in accordance with a strict code of practice and are protected by state and federal legislation  Kangaroo meat is exported to many countries around the world   7  See also  Boxing kangaroo  symbol   Embryonic diapause  Kangaroo court  mock justice
