Vela is a constellation in the southern sky  Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship  and it was originally part of a larger constellation  the ship Argo Navis  which was later divided into three or four parts  the others being Carina  Puppis and  according to some authorities  Pyxis  With an apparent magnitude of 1 8  its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum  one component of which is the brightest Wolf Rayet star in the sky  Delta and Kappa Velorum  together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae  form the asterism known as the False Cross  1 95 magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system   1  History  Argo Navis was one of the 48 classical constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy  and represented the ship Argo  used by Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece in Greek mythology  German cartographer Johann Bayer depicted the constellation on his Uranometria of 1603  and gave the stars Bayer designations from Alpha to Omega  However  his chart was inaccurate as the constellation was not visible from the Northern Hemisphere   Argo was more accurately charted and subdivided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille  forming Carina  Vela  Puppis and Pyxis  Despite the division  Lacaille kept Argo s Bayer designations  Therefore Carina has the Alpha  Beta and Epsilon  Vela has Gamma and Delta  and Puppis has Zeta  and so on   2  Characteristics  Vela is bordered by Antlia and Pyxis to the north  Puppis to the northwest  Carina to the south and southwest  and Centaurus to the east  Covering 500 square degrees  it ranks 32nd of the 88 modern constellations in size  The three letter abbreviation for the constellation  as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922  is  Vel    The official constellation boundaries  as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930  are defined by a polygon of 14 segments  In the equatorial coordinate system  the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and   while the declination coordinates are between −37 16° and −57 17°   3  Notable features  3 1  Stars  The brightest star in the constellation  Gamma Velorum  is a complex multiple star system  The brighter component  known as Gamma2 Velorum or Regor  shines as a blue white star of apparent magnitude 1 81  It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78 5 days and separated by somewhere between 0 8 and 1 2 Astronomical Units  AU   The brighter component is a hot blue main sequence star of spectral type O7 5 and is around 180 000 times as luminous  is around 30 times as massive and is 13 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 32500 K  The second component is an extremely rare hot star known as a Wolf–Rayet star  and is the brightest example in the sky  It has a surface temperature of 57 000 to 70 000 K  and is around 100 000 times as luminous as our sun  though radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum  The two are separated from Gamma1 Velorum by 41 arcseconds  easily separable in binoculars  Gamma1 is a blue white star of spectral type B1IV and magnitude 4 2  It lies around 15 000 astronomical units from the brighter pair  Parallax measurements give a distance of 1116 light years  Further afield are 7 3 magnitude Gamma Velorum C and 9 4 magnitude Gamma Velorum D  lying 62 and 93 arcseconds southsoutheast from Gamma2  All four stars have a bluish hue   The next brightest star is Delta Velorum  also a multiple star system and one of the brightest eclipsing binaries in the sky  Together with Kappa Velorum  Iota and Epsilon Carinae  it forms the diamond shaped asterism known as the False Cross—so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross  causing errors in astronavigation  Like the Southern Cross  three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange  but it is larger and fainter  Appearing as a white star of magnitude 1 95  Delta is actually a triple or possibly quintuple star system located around 80 light years from our Solar System  Delta A has a magnitude of 1 99 and is an eclipsing binary composed of two A type white stars  Delta Aa and Ab  which orbit each other every 45 2 days and lie 0 5 AU from each other  with a resulting drop in magnitude of 0 4 when the dimmer one passes in front of the brighter  Delta B is a 5 1 magnitude yellow G class star of similar dimensions to our sun which ranges between 26 and 72 AU away from the brighter pair  taking 142 years to complete a revolution  Further out still  at a distance of 1700 AU  are two red dwarfs of magnitudes 11 and 13  If they are part of the multiple system  they take 28000 years to complete and orbit  Also called Markeb  Kappa appears as a blue white star of spectral type B2IV V and magnitude 2 47 but is in fact a spectroscopic binary  The two orbit around each other with a period of 116 65 days  but the size  mass and nature of the companion are as yet unclear   The orange hued Lambda Velorum  or Suhail  is the third brightest star in the constellation  A supergiant of spectral type K4Ib II  it varies between magnitudes 2 14 and 2 3  and lies 545 light years distant  It has around 11 000 times the luminosity  9 to 12 times the mass and 207 times the diameter or our sun   AH Velorum is a Cepheid variable located less than a degree to the northeast of Gamma  A yellow white supergiant of spectral type F7Ib II  it pulsates between magnitudes 5 5 and 5 89 over 4 2 days  Also lying close to Gamma  V Velorum is a Cepheid of spectral type F6 F9II ranging from magnitude 7 2 to 7 9 over 4 4 days  AI Velorum is located 2 8 degrees northnortheast of Gamma  a Delta Scuti variable of spectral type A2p F2pIV V that ranges between magniudes 6 15 and 6 76 in around 2 7 hours   V390 Velorum is an aged star that has been found to be surrounded by a dusty disk  An RV Tauri variable  it has a spectral type of F3e and ranges between magnitudes 9 01 and 9 27 over nearly 95 days   Omicron Velorum is a blue white subgiant of spectral type B3III IV located around 495 light years from our Solar System  A slowly pulsating B star  it ranges between magnitudes 3 57 and 3 63 over 2 8 days  It is the brightest star in  and gives its name to  the Omicron Velorum Cluster  also known as IC 2391  an open cluster located around 500 light years away   Seven star systems have been found to have planets  HD 75289 is a sunlike star of spectral type G0V with a hot Jupiter planetary companion that takes only about 3 51 days to revolve at an orbital distance of 0 0482 AU  WASP 19 is a star of apparent magnitude 12 3 located 815 light years away  which has a hot Jupiter planet that orbits every 0 7 days  HD 73526 is a sunlike

Earth  The stars of NGC 2670  a Trumpler class II 2 p and Shapley class d cluster  are in a conformation suggesting a bow and arrow  Its class indicates that it is a poor  loose cluster  though detached from the star field  It is somewhat concentrated at its center  and its less than 50 stars range moderately in brightness   Located 2 degrees south of Gamma Velorum  NGC 2547 is an open cluster containing around 50 stars of magnitudes 7 to 15   NGC 3201 is a globular cluster that was discovered by James Dunlop on May 28  1826  Its stellar population is inhomogeneous  varying with distance from the core  The effective temperature of the stars shows an increase with greater distance  with the redder and cooler stars tending to be located closer to the core  As of 2010  is one of only two clusters  including Messier 4  that shows a definite inhomogeneous population   4  References  Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion  2007   Stars and Planets Guide  Collins  London  ISBN 978 0 00
