Kentucky   officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky  is a state located in the east south central region of the United States  Kentucky is one of four U S  states constituted as a commonwealth  the others being Virginia  Pennsylvania  and Massachusetts   Originally a part of Virginia  in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union  Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States   Kentucky is known as the  Bluegrass State   a nickname based on the bluegrass found in many of its pastures due to the fertile soil  One of the major regions in Kentucky is the Bluegrass Region in central Kentucky which houses two of its major cities  Louisville and Lexington  It is a land with diverse environments and abundant resources  including the world s longest cave system  Mammoth Cave National Park  the greatest length of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous United States  and the two largest man made lakes east of the Mississippi River   Kentucky is also home to the highest per capita number of deer and turkey in the United States  the largest free ranging elk herd east of the Mississippi River  and the nation s most productive coalfield  Kentucky is also known for horse racing  bourbon distilleries  automobile manufacturing  tobacco  bluegrass music  college basketball  and Kentucky Fried Chicken   1  Etymology  Kentucky was named from the Kentucky River  While some sources say the etymology is uncertain  most agree on a meaning of   on  the meadow  or   on  the prairie   cf  Mohawk kenhtà ke  Seneca gëdá’geh  phonemic     at the field     2  Geography  Kentucky is situated in the Upland South  A significant portion of eastern Kentucky is part of Appalachia   Kentucky borders seven states  from the Midwest and the Southeast  West Virginia lies to the east  Virginia to the southeast  Tennessee to the south  Missouri to the west  Illinois and Indiana to the northwest  and Ohio to the north and northeast  Only Missouri and Tennessee  both of which border eight states  touch more states   Kentucky s northern border is formed by the Ohio River and its western border by the Mississippi River  The official state borders are based on the courses of the rivers as they existed when Kentucky became a state in 1792  In several places  the rivers have changed courses away from the original borders  For instance  northbound travelers on US 41 from Henderson  after crossing the Ohio River  will be in Kentucky for about two miles  Ellis Park  a thoroughbred racetrack  is located in this small piece of Kentucky  Waterworks Road is part of the only land border between Indiana and Kentucky   Kentucky has a non contiguous part known as Kentucky Bend  at the far west corner of the state  It exists as an exclave surrounded completely by Missouri and Tennessee  and is included in the boundaries of Fulton County  Road access to this small part of Kentucky on the Mississippi River  populated by only about 17 people  requires a trip through Tennessee  The epicenter of the powerful 1811–1812 New Madrid Earthquakes was near this area  even causing the river to flow backwards in some places  Though the series of quakes did change the area geologically and affect the  small number of  inhabitants of the area at the time  the Kentucky Bend was formed because of a surveying error  not the New Madrid Earthquake   2 1  Regions  Kentucky can be divided into five primary regions  the Cumberland Plateau in the east  the north central Bluegrass region  the south central and western Pennyroyal Plateau  the Western Coal Fields and the far west Jackson Purchase   The Bluegrass region is commonly divided into two regions  the Inner Bluegrass—the encircling 90 miles  145 km  around Lexington—and the Outer Bluegrass—the region that contains most of the northern portion of the state  above the Knobs  Much of the outer Bluegrass is in the Eden Shale Hills area  made up of short  steep  and very narrow hills   The Jackson Purchase and western Pennyrile are home to several bald cypress tupelo swamps   2 2  Climate  Located within the southeastern interior portion of North America  Kentucky has a climate that can best be described as a humid subtropical climate  Koppen Cfa   Temperatures in Kentucky usually range from daytime summer highs of to the winter low of   The average precipitation is a year   Kentucky experiences four distinct seasons  with substantial variations in the severity of summer and winter  The highest recorded temperature was at Greensburg on July 28  1930 while the lowest recorded temperature was at Shelbyville on January 19  1994   2 3  Lakes and rivers  Kentucky has more navigable miles of water than any other state in the union  other than Alaska   Kentucky is the only U S  state to be bordered on three sides by rivers—the Mississippi River to the west  the Ohio River to the north  and the Big Sandy River and Tug Fork to the east  Its major internal rivers include the Kentucky River  Tennessee River  Cumberland River  Green River and Licking River   Though it has only three major natural lakes  Kentucky is home to many artificial lakes  Kentucky has both the largest artificial lake east of the Mississippi in water volume  Lake Cumberland  and surface area  Kentucky Lake   Kentucky Lake s 2 064 miles  3 322 km  of shoreline  160 300 acres  64 900 ha  of water surface  and 4 008 000 acre feet  4 944 Gl  of flood storage are the most of any lake in the TVA system   Kentucky s of streams provides one of the most expansive and complex stream systems in the nation   2 4  Natural environment and conservation  Kentucky has an expansive park system which includes one national park  two National Recreation areas  two National Historic Parks  two national forests  two National Wildlife Refuges  45 state parks  of state forest  and 82 Wildlife Management Areas   Kentucky has been part of two of the most successful wildlife reintroduction projects in United States history  In the winter of 1997  the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources began to re stock elk in the state s eastern counties  which had been extinct from the area for over 150 years  As of 2009  the herd had reached the project goal of 10 000 animals  making it the largest herd east of the Mississippi River   The state also stocked wild turkeys in the 1950s  Once extinct here  more wild turkeys thrive in Kentucky today than in any other eastern state  Hunters telechecked a record 29 006 birds taken during the 23 day season in Spring 2009   A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County  Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times   2 5  Significant natural attractions

roamed in the region  By the time that European and colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater number in the mid 18th century  there were no major Native American settlements in the region  The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley for hunting from their bases in what is now New York   The Shawnee from the northwest and Cherokee from the south also sent parties into the area regularly for hunting  As more settlers entered the area  warfare broke out because the Native Americans considered the settlers to be encroaching on their traditional hunting grounds  Today there are two state recognized tribes in Kentucky  the Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky and the Ridgetop Shawnee   A 1790 U S  government report states that 1 500 Kentucky settlers had been killed by Native Americans since the end of the Revolutionary War  In 1786  George Rogers Clark led a group of 1 200 men in actions against Shawnee towns on the Wabash River to begin the Northwest Indian War   After the American Revolution  the counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains became known as Kentucky County  Eventually  the residents of Kentucky County petitioned for a separation from Virginia  Ten constitutional conventions were held in the Constitution Square Courthouse in Danville between 1784 and 1792  In 1790  Kentucky s delegates accepted Virginia s terms of separation  and a state constitution was drafted at the final convention in April 1792  On June 1  1792  Kentucky became the fifteenth state to be admitted to the union  Isaac Shelby  a military veteran from Virginia  was elected the first Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky   3 1  19th century  Central Kentucky  the Bluegrass region  was the center of the greatest slaveholding  as planters cultivated tobacco and hemp  and also were noted for their quality livestock  During the 19th century  Kentucky slaveholders began to sell surplus slaves to the Deep South  with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported downriver   Kentucky was one of the border states during the American Civil War  Although frequently described as never having seceded  representatives from several counties met at Russellville calling themselves the  Convention of the People of Kentucky  and passed an Ordinance of Secession on November 20  1861  They established a Confederate government of Kentucky with its capital in Bowling Green   Though Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag  Kentucky officially remained  neutral  throughout the war due to Union sympathies of some of the Commonwealth s citizens  In a revival of the  Lost Cause  that has exceeded the support it gained during the war  some modern day Kentuckians observe Confederate Memorial Day on Confederate President Jefferson Davis  birthday  June 3 and participate in Confederate re enactments  Both Confederate President Jefferson Davis and U S  President Abraham Lincoln were born in Kentucky   3 2  20th century  The Black Patch Tobacco Wars  a vigilante action  occurred in the area in the early 20th century  As result of the tobacco industry monopoly  tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their tobacco at low prices  Many local farmers and activists united to refuse to sell tobacco to the tobacco industry   A vigilante wing  the  Night Riders   terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations  They burned several tobacco warehouses  notably in Hopkinsville and Princeton  In the later period of their operation  they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott  The Governor declared martial law and deployed the Kentucky Militia to end the Black Patch Tobacco Wars   On January 30  1900  Governor William Goebel  flanked by two bodyguards  was mortally wounded by an assassin while walking to the State Capitol in downtown Frankfort  Goebel was contesting the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899  which William S  Taylor was initially believed to have won  For several months  J  C  W  Beckham  Goebel s running mate  and Taylor fought over who was the legal governor  until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in May in favor of Beckham  After fleeing to Indiana  Taylor was indicted as a co conspirator in Goebel s assassination  Goebel is the only governor of a U S  state to have been assassinated while in office   4  Law and government  Kentucky is one of four U S  states to officially use the term commonwealth  The term was used for Kentucky as it had also been used by Virginia  from which Kentucky was created  The term has no particular significance in its meaning and was chosen to emphasize the distinction from the status of royal colonies as a place governed for the general welfare of the populace   The commonwealth term was used in citizen petitions submitted between 1786 and 1792 for the creation of the state  It was also used in the title of a history of the state that was published in 1834 and was used in various places within that book in references to Virginia and Kentucky  The other two states officially called  commonwealths  are Massachusetts and Pennsylvania   Kentucky is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years  the others being Louisiana  Mississippi  New Jersey  and Virginia   Kentucky holds elections for these offices every 4 years in the years preceding Presidential election years  Thus  Kentucky held gubernatorial elections in 2003  2007  and 2011   4 1  Executive branch  The executive branch is headed by the governor who serves as both head of state and head of government  The lieutenant governor may or may not have executive authority depending on whether the person is a member of the Governor s cabinet  Under the current Kentucky Constitution  the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor only if the governor is incapacitated   Prior to 1992  the lieutenant governor assumed power any time the governor was out of the state   The governor and lieutenant governor usually run on a single ticket  also per a 1992 constitutional amendment   and are elected to four year terms  Currently  the governor and lieutenant governor are Democrats Steve Beshear and Crit Luallen   Other elected constitutional offices include the Secretary of State  Attorney General  Auditor of Public Accounts  State Treasurer and Commissioner of Agriculture  Currently  Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes serves as the Secretary of State  The commonwealth s chief prosecutor  law enforcement officer  and law officer is the Attorney General  currently Democrat Jack Conway  The Auditor of Public Accounts is Democrat Adam Edelen  Democrat Todd Hollenbach is the current Treasurer  Republican James Comer is the current Commissioner of Agriculture   4 2  Legislative branch  Kentucky s legislative branch consists of a bicameral body known as the Kentucky General Assembly   The Senate is considered the upper house  It has 38 members  and is led by the President of the Senate  currently Robert Stivers  R    The House of Representatives has 100 members  and is led by the Speaker of the House  currently Greg Stumbo  D    4 3  Judicial branch  The judicial branch of Kentucky is called the and comprises courts of limited jurisdiction called District Courts  courts of general jurisdiction called Circuit Courts  specialty courts such as     an intermediate appellate court  the Kentucky Court of Appeals  and a court of last resort  the Kentucky Supreme Court   The Kentucky Court of Justice is headed by the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth   Unlike federal judges  who are usually appointed  justices serving on Kentucky state courts are chosen by the state s populace in non partisan elections   4 4  Federal representation  Kentucky s two U S  Senators are Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul  both Republicans  The state is divided into six Congressional Districts  represented by Republicans Ed Whitfield  1st   Brett Guthrie  2nd   Thomas Massie  4th   Hal Rogers  5th  and Andy Barr  6th  and Democrat John Yarmuth  3rd    In the federal judiciary  Kentucky is served by two United States district courts  the Eastern District of Kentucky  with its primary seat in Lexington  and the Western District of Kentucky  with its primary seat in Louisville  Appeals are heard in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit  based in Cincinnati  Ohio   4 5  Law  Kentucky s body of laws  known as the Kentucky Revised Statutes  KRS   were enacted in 1942 to better organize and clarify the whole of Kentucky law  The statutes are enforced by local police  sheriffs and deputy sheriffs  and constables and deputy constables  Unless they have completed a police academy elsewhere  these officers are required to complete training at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Center on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University  Additionally  in 1948  the Kentucky General Assembly established the Kentucky State Police  making it the 38th state to create a force whose jurisdiction extends throughout the given state   Kentucky is one of the 32 states in the United States that sanctions the death penalty for certain heinous murders  Those convicted of capital crimes after March 31  1998 are always executed by lethal injection  those convicted on or before this date may opt for the electric chair  Only three people have been executed in Kentucky since the U S  Supreme Court re instituted the practice in 1976  The most notable execution in Kentucky  however  was that of Rainey Bethea on August 14  1936  Bethea was publicly hanged in Owensboro for the rape and murder of Lischia Edwards  Irregularities with the execution led to this becoming the last public execution in the United States   Kentucky has been on the front lines of the debate over displaying the Ten Commandments on public property  In the 2005 case of McCreary County v  ACLU of Kentucky  the U S  Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that a display of the Ten Commandments in the Whitley City courthouse of McCreary County was unconstitutional  Later that year  Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich  writing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of ACLU of Kentucky v  Mercer County  wrote that a display including the Mayflower Compact  the Declaration of Independence  the Ten Commandments  the Magna Carta  The Star Spangled Banner  and the national motto could be erected in the Mercer County courthouse  Still  a 2008 study found that Kentucky s Supreme Court to be the least influential high court in the nation with its decisions rarely being followed by other states   Kentucky has also been known to have unusually high political candidacy age laws  especially compared to surrounding states  The origin of this is unknown  but it has been suggested it has to do with the commonwealth tradition   4 6  Politics  Where politics are concerned  Kentucky historically has been very hard fought and leaned slightly toward the Democratic Party  although it was never included among the  Solid South   In 2006  57 05% of the state s voters were officially registered as Democrats  36 55% registered Republican  and 6 39% registered with some other political party  Despite this  the state often supports Republican candidates for federal offices   From 1964 through 2004  Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States  In the 2008 election  however  the state lost its bellwether status when John McCain  who won Kentucky  lost the national popular and electoral vote to Barack Obama  McCain carried Kentucky 57 to 41%    The Commonwealth supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House  all elected from Southern states  Lyndon B  Johnson  Texas  in 1964  Jimmy Carter  Georgia  in 1976  and Bill Clinton  Arkansas  in 1992 and 1996  In presidential elections  the state has become a Republican stronghold  supporting that party s presidential candidates by double digit margins in 2000  2004  2008 and 2012   5  Demographics  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Kentucky was 4 413 457 on July 1  2014  a 1 71% increase since the 2010 United States Census   As of July 1  2014  Kentucky had an estimated population of 4 413 457  which is an increase of 18 162  from the prior year and an increase of 74 090  or 1 71%  since the year 2010  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 77 156 people  that is 287 222 births minus 210 066 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 59 604 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 27 435 people  and migration within the country produced a net increase of 32 169 people  As of 2004  Kentucky s population included about 95 000 foreign born persons  2 3%   The population density of the state is 101 7 people per square mile   Kentucky s total population has grown during every decade since records began  However  during most decades of the 20th century there was also net out migration from Kentucky  Since 1900  rural Kentucky counties have experienced a net loss of over 1 million people from migration  while urban areas have experienced a slight net gain   The center of population of Kentucky is located in Washington County  in the city of Willisburg   5 1  Race and ancestry  According to US Census Bureau official statistics the largest ancestry in 2013 was American totalling 20 2%  In 1980  before you could mark yourself as an ethnic American  the largest ancestries in the commonwealth were  English  28 7%   German  11 1%   Irish  8 8%   and African  7 8%  In the state s most urban counties of Jefferson  Oldham  Fayette  Boone  Kenton  and Campbell  German is the largest reported ancestry  Americans of Scots Irish and English stock are present throughout the entire state  Many claim Irish ancestry because of known  Scots Irish  among their ancestors  who were descendants of immigrants from Scotland  via some years in Ireland  Southeastern Kentucky was populated by a large group of multi racial settlers  sometimes called Melungeons  in the early 19th century  As of the 1980s the only counties in the United States where over half of the population cited  English  as their only ancestry group were all in the hills of eastern Kentucky  and made up virtually every county in this region   In the 1980 census 1 267 079 Kentuckians out of a total population of 2 554 359 cited that they were of English ancestry making them 49 percent of the state at that time   Groups such as the Ridgetop Shawnee in the early 21st century organised as a non profit to increase awareness of Native Americans in Kentucky  In the 2000 census  there were 20 000 people in the state who identified as Native American  0 49%   In June 2011  Jerry  2 Feather  Thornton  a Cherokee  led a team in the Voyage of Native American Awareness 2011 canoe journey  to begin on the Green River in Rochester  Kentucky and travel through to the Ohio River at Henderson   African Americans  who made up 25% of Kentucky s population prior to the Civil War  primarily in the Bluegrass region  declined in number during the 20th century  Many migrated to the industrial North and Midwest in the Great Migration for jobs  Today  less than 8% of the state s total population is African American  and it is highly urbanized  concentrated near Louisville  52% of the state s African American population is in the Louisville Metro Area  44 2% is in Jefferson County  The county had a population that is 20% African American  Other areas with high concentrations  beside Christian and Fulton counties and the Bluegrass region  are the cities of Paducah and Lexington  Some mining communities in far Southeastern Kentucky have populations that are between five and 10 percent African American   5 2  Religion  As of 2010  the Association of Religion Data Archives  ARDA  reported the following groupings of Kentucky s 4 339 367 residents   48% not affiliated with any religious group  33% in Evangelical Protestant churches  23% Southern Baptist Convention  1 004 407 members   8%

Presbyterian Church  U S A   and their printing press  Louisville also has Muslim  Jewish  and Hindu communities   The Christian creationist apologetics group Answers in Genesis  along with its Creation Museum  is headquartered in Petersburg  Kentucky   6  Economy  Early in its history Kentucky gained recognition for its excellent farming conditions  It was the site of the first commercial winery in the United States  started in present day Jessamine County in 1799  and due to the high calcium content of the soil in the Bluegrass region quickly became a major horse breeding  and later racing  area  Today Kentucky ranks 5th nationally in goat farming  8th in beef cattle production  and 14th in corn production   Today Kentucky s economy has expanded to importance in non agricultural terms as well  especially in auto manufacturing  energy fuel production  and medical facilities  As of 2010 24% of electricity produced in the USA depended on either enriched uranium rods coming from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant  the only domestic site of low grade uranium enrichment   or from the 107 336 tons of coal extracted from the state s two coal fields  which combined produce 4% percent of the electricity in the United States    Kentucky ranks 4th among U S  states in the number of automobiles and trucks assembled  The Chevrolet Corvette  Cadillac XLR  2004–2009   Ford Escape  Ford Super Duty trucks  Ford Expedition  Lincoln Navigator  Toyota Camry  Toyota Avalon  Toyota Solara  and Toyota Venza are assembled in Kentucky   Kentucky exports reached a record $22 1 billion in 2012  with products and services going to 199 countries   According to the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development  the primary state agency in Kentucky responsible for creating new jobs and new investment in the state  new business investment in Kentucky in 2012 totaled nearly $2 7 billion  with the creation of more than 14 000 new jobs  One such investment was L Oreal in Northern Kentucky which added 200 jobs on top of the 280 already in existing facilities in Florence and Walton   In May 2010  the Army Human Resource Center of Excellence  the largest office building in the state at nearly 900 000 square feet  opened at Fort Knox  The new complex employs nearly 4 300 soldiers and civilians   The total gross state product for 2010 was $163 3 billion  28th in the nation  Its per capita personal income was US$28 513  43rd in the nation  An organization called the Institute for Truth in Accounting estimated that the state government s debts exceeded its available assets by per taxpayer as of 2011  ranking the state as having the 5th highest such debt burden in the nation   As of November 2014  the state s unemployment rate is 6 0%  In 2014 Kentucky was found to be the most affordable US state in which to live   6 1  Taxation  There are 6 income tax brackets  ranging from 2% to 6% of personal income  The sales tax rate in Kentucky is 6%  Kentucky has a broadly based classified property tax system  All classes of property  unless exempted by the Constitution  are taxed by the state  although at widely varying rates   Many of these classes are exempted from taxation by local government  Of the classes that are subject to local taxation  three have special rates set by the General Assembly  one by the Kentucky Supreme Court and the remaining classes are subject to the full local rate  which includes the tax rate set by the local taxing bodies plus all voted levies  Real property is assessed on 100% of the fair market value and property taxes are due by December 31  Once the primary source of state and local government revenue  property taxes now account for only about 6% of the Kentucky s annual General Fund revenues   Until January 1  2006  Kentucky imposed a tax on intangible personal property held by a taxpayer on January 1 of each year  The Kentucky intangible tax was repealed under House Bill 272  Intangible property consisted of any property or investment which represents evidence of value or the right to value  Some types of intangible property included  bonds  notes  retail repurchase agreements  accounts receivable  trusts  enforceable contracts sale of real estate  land contracts   money in hand  money in safe deposit boxes  annuities  interests in estates  loans to stockholders  and commercial paper   6 2  Government promoted slogans  In December 2002  the Kentucky governor Paul Patton unveiled the state slogan  It s that friendly   in hope of drawing more people into the state based on the idea of southern hospitality  This campaign was neither a failure nor a success  Though it was meant to embrace southern values  many Kentuckians rejected the slogan as cheesy and ineffective  It was quickly seen that the slogan did not encourage tourism as much as initially hoped for  So government decided to create a different slogan to embrace Kentucky as a whole while also encouraging more people to visit the Bluegrass   To boost Kentucky s image  give it a consistent reach  and help it  stand out from the crowd   former Governor Ernie Fletcher launched a comprehensive branding campaign at some later point in time with the hope of making the state s $12–14 million advertising budget more effective  The resulting  Unbridled Spirit  brand was the result of a $500 000 contract with New West  a Kentucky based public relations advertising and marketing firm to develop a viable brand and tag line  The Fletcher administration aggressively marketed the brand in both the public and private sectors  Since that time  the  Welcome to Kentucky  signs at border areas have an  Unbridled Spirit  symbol on them   7  Transportation  7 1  Roads  Kentucky is served by six major interstate highways  I 24  I 64  I 65  I 69  I 71  and I 75   nine   and four bypasses and spurs  I 264  I 265  I 275  and I 471   The parkways were originally toll roads  but on November 22  2006  Governor Ernie Fletcher ended the toll charges on the William H  Natcher Parkway and the Audubon Parkway  the last two parkways in Kentucky to charge tolls for access  The related toll booths have been demolished   Ending the tolls some seven months ahead of schedule was generally agreed to have been a positive economic development for transportation in Kentucky  In June 2007  a law went into effect raising the speed limit on rural portions of Kentucky Interstates from    Road tunnels include the interstate Cumberland Gap Tunnel and the rural Nada Tunnel   Greyhound provides bus service to most major cities in the state   7 2  Rails  Amtrak  the national passenger rail system  provides service to Ashland  South Portsmouth  Maysville and Fulton  The Cardinal  trains 50 and 51  is the line that offers Amtrak service to Ashland  South Shore  Maysville and South Portsmouth  The City of New Orleans  trains 58 and 59  serve Fulton  The Northern Kentucky area is served by the Cardinal at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal  The Museum Center is just across the Ohio River in Cincinnati   As of 2004  there were approximately of railways in Kentucky  with about 65% of those being operated by CSX Transportation  Coal was by far the most common cargo  accounting for 76% of cargo loaded and 61% of cargo delivered   Bardstown features a tourist attraction known as My Old Kentucky Dinner Train  Run along a stretch of rail purchased from CSX in 1987  guests are served a four course meal as they make a two and a half hour round trip between Bardstown and Limestone Springs  The Kentucky Railway Museum is located in nearby New Haven   Other areas in Kentucky are reclaiming old railways in rail trail projects  One such project is Louisville s Big Four Bridge  If completed  the Big Four Bridge rail trail will contain the second longest pedestrian only bridge in the world  The longest pedestrian only bridge is also found in Kentucky—the Newport Southbank Bridge  popularly known as the  Purple People Bridge   connecting Newport to Cincinnati  Ohio   7 3  Air  Kentucky s primary airports include Louisville International Airport  Standiford Field  SDF   of Louisville  Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport  CVG  of Covington and Northern Kentucky  and Blue Grass Airport  LEX  in Lexington  Louisville International Airport is home to UPS s Worldport  its international air sorting hub  There are also a number of regional airports scattered across the state   On August 27  2006  Kentucky s Blue Grass Airport in Lexington was the site of a crash that killed 47 passengers and 2 crew members aboard a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet designated Comair Flight 191  or Delta Air Lines Flight 5191  sometimes mistakenly identified by the press as Comair Flight 5191  The lone survivor was the flight s first officer  James Polehinke  who doctors determined to be brain damaged and unable to recall the crash at all   7 4  Water  As the state is bounded by two of the largest rivers in North America  water transportation has historically played a major role in Kentucky s economy  Louisville was a major port for steamships in the nineteenth century  Today  most barge traffic on Kentucky waterways consists of coal that is shipped from both the Eastern and Western Coalfields  about half of which is used locally to power many power plants located directly off the Ohio River  with the rest being exported to other countries  most notably Japan   Many of the largest ports in the United States are located in or adjacent to Kentucky  including   Huntington Tristate  includes Ashland  KY   largest inland port and 7th largest overall  Cincinnati Northern Kentucky  5th largest inland port and 43rd overall  Louisville Southern Indiana  7th largest inland port and 55th overall As a state  Kentucky ranks 10th overall in port tonnage   The only natural obstacle along the entire length of the Ohio River is the Falls of the Ohio  located just west of Downtown Louisville   8  Subdivisions and settlements  8 1  Counties  Kentucky is subdivided into 120 counties  the largest being Pike County at   and the most populous being Jefferson County  which coincides with the Louisville Metro governmental area  with 741 096 residents as of 2010   County government  under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891  is vested in the County Judge Executive   formerly called the County Judge  who serves as the executive head of the county  and a legislature called a Fiscal Court  Despite the unusual name  the Fiscal Court no longer has judicial functions   8 2  Consolidated city county governments  Kentucky s two most populous counties  Jefferson and Fayette  have their governments consolidated with the governments of their largest cities  Louisville Jefferson County Government  Louisville Metro  and Lexington Fayette Urban County Government  Lexington Metro  are unique in that their city councils and county Fiscal Court structures have been merged into a single entity with a single chief executive  the Metro Mayor and Urban County Mayor  respectively  Although the counties still exist as subdivisions of the state  in reference the names Louisville and Lexington are used to refer to the entire area coextensive with the former cities and counties  Somewhat incongruously  when entering Lexington Fayette the highway signs read  Fayette County  while most signs leading into Louisville Jefferson simply read  Welcome to Louisville Metro    8 3  Major cities  The Metro Louisville government area has a 2010 population of 741 096  Under United States Census Bureau methodology  the population of Louisville was 566 503  The latter figure is the population of the so called  balance —the parts of Jefferson County that were either unincorporated or within the City of Louisville before the formation of the merged government in 2003  In 2010  the Louisville Combined Statistical Area  CSA  has a population of 1 451 564  including 1 061 031 in Kentucky  which is nearly one fourth of the state s population  Since 2000  over one third of the state s population growth has occurred in the Louisville CSA  In addition  the top 28 wealthiest places in Kentucky are in Jefferson County and seven of the 15 wealthiest counties in the state are located in the Louisville CSA   The second largest city is Lexington with a 2010 census population of 295 803 and its CSA  which includes the Frankfort and Richmond statistical areas  having a population of 687 173  The Northern Kentucky area  the seven Kentucky counties in the Cincinnati MSA  had a population of 425 483 in 2010  The metropolitan areas of Louisville  Lexington  and Northern Kentucky have a combined population of 2 173 687 as of 2010  which is 50 1% of the state s total population   The two other fast growing urban areas in Kentucky are the Bowling Green area and the  Tri Cities Region  of southeastern Kentucky  comprising Somerset  London and Corbin   Although only one town in the  Tri Cities   namely Somerset  currently has more than 12 000 people  the area has been experiencing heightened population and job growth since the 1990s  Growth has been especially rapid in Laurel County  which outgrew areas such as Scott and Jessamine counties around Lexington or Shelby and Nelson Counties around Louisville  London significantly grew in population in the 2000s  from 5 692 in 2000 to 7 993 in 2010  London also landed a Wal Mart distribution center in 1997  bringing thousands of jobs to the community   In northeast Kentucky  the greater Ashland area is an important transportation  manufacturing  and medical center  Iron and petroleum production  as well as the transport of coal by rail and barge  have been historical pillars of the region s economy  Due to a decline in the area s industrial base  Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990  The population of the area has since stabilized  however  with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy  The Ashland area  including the counties of Boyd and Greenup  are part of the Huntington Ashland  WV KY OH  Metropolitan Statistical Area  MSA   As of the 2000 census  the MSA had a population of 288 649  More than 21 000 of those people  as of 2010  reside within the city limits of Ashland   The largest county in Kentucky by area is Pike  which contains Pikeville and suburb Coal Run Village   The county and surrounding area is the most populated region in the state that is not part of a Micropolitan Statistical Area or a Metropolitan Statistical Area containing nearly 200 000 people in five counties  Floyd County  Martin County  Letcher County  and neighboring Mingo County  West Virginia  Pike County contains slightly over 68 000 people   Only three U S  states have capitals with smaller populations than Kentucky s Frankfort  pop  25 527   those being Augusta  Maine  pop  18 560   Pierre  South Dakota  pop  13 876   and Montpelier  Vermont  pop  8 035    9  Education  Kentucky maintains eight public four year universities  There are two general tiers  major research institutions  the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville  and regional universities  which encompasses the remaining 6 schools  The regional schools have specific target counties that many of their programs are targeted towards  such as Forestry at Eastern Kentucky University or Cave Management at Western Kentucky University   however most of their curriculum varies little from any other public university   UK and UofL have the highest academic rankings and admissions standards although the regional schools aren t without their national recognized departments – examples being Western Kentucky University s nationally ranked Journalism Department or Morehead State University offering one of the nation s only Space Science degrees  UK is the flagship and land grant of the system and has agriculture extension services in every county  The two research schools split duties related to the medical field  UK handles all medical outreach programs in the eastern half of the state while UofL does all medical outreach in the state s western half   The state s sixteen public two year colleges have been governed by the Kentucky Community and Technical College System since the passage of the Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997  commonly referred to as House Bill 1  Prior to the passage of House Bill 1  most of these colleges were under the control of the University of Kentucky   Transylvania University  located in Lexington  is the oldest university west of the Allegheny Mountains  founded in 1780  Transylvania is a liberal arts university  consistently ranked in the top tier in the country   Berea College  located at the extreme southern edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau  was the first coeducational college in the South to admit both black and white students  doing so from its very establishment in 1855  This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of Berea College v  Kentucky in 1908  This decision effectively segregated Berea until the landmark Brown v  Board of Education in 1954   There are 174 school districts and 1 233 public schools in Kentucky  For the 2010 to 2011 school year  there were approximately 647 827 students enrolled in public school   Kentucky has been the site of much educational reform over the past two decades  In 1989  the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the state s education system was unconstitutional  The response of the General Assembly was passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act  KERA  the following year  Years later  Kentucky has shown progress  but most agree that further reform is needed   10  Culture  Although Kentucky s culture is generally considered to be Southern  it is unique in that it is also influenced by the Midwest and Southern Appalachia in certain areas of the state  The state is known for bourbon and whiskey distilling  tobacco  horse racing  and college basketball  Kentucky is more similar to the Upland South in terms of ancestry which is predominantly American   Nevertheless  during the 19th century  Kentucky did receive a substantial number of German immigrants  who settled mostly in the Midwest  along the Ohio River primarily in Louisville  Covington and Newport  Only Maryland  Delaware and West Virginia have higher German ancestry percentages than Kentucky among Census defined Southern states  although Kentucky s percentage is closer to Arkansas and Virginia s than the previously named state s percentages  Scottish Americans  English Americans and Scotch Irish Americans have heavily influenced Kentucky culture  and are present in every part of the state  As of the 1980s the only counties in the United States where over half of the population cited  English  as their only ancestry group were all in the hills of eastern Kentucky  and made up virtually every county in this region    Kentucky was a slave state  and blacks once comprised over one quarter of its population  However  it lacked the cotton plantation system and never had the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states  With less than 8% of its current population being black  Kentucky is rarely included in modern day definitions of the Black Belt  despite a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state   Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the Civil War  but the state never disenfranchised African American citizens to the level of the Deep South states  and it peacefully integrated its schools after the 1954 Brown v  Board of Education verdict  later adopting the first state civil rights act in the South in 1966   The biggest day in American horse racing  the Kentucky

sisters credited with composing the tune to the ditty Happy Birthday to You in 1893  Loretta Lynn  Johnson County   Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet Boys  and Billy Ray Cyrus  Flatwoods    However  its depth lies in its signature sound—Bluegrass music  Bill Monroe   The Father of Bluegrass   was born in the small Ohio County town of Rosine  while Ricky Skaggs  Keith Whitley

are also from Kentucky   In eastern Kentucky  old time music carries on the tradition of ancient ballads and reels developed in historical Appalachia   10 2  Cuisine  Kentucky s cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking  although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest  One original Kentucky dish is called the Hot Brown  a dish normally layered in this order  toasted bread  turkey  bacon  tomatoes and topped with mornay sauce  It was developed at the Brown Hotel in Louisville  The Pendennis Club in Louisville is the birthplace of the Old Fashioned cocktail  Also  western Kentucky is known for its own regional style of barbecue   Louisville is well known for its many boutique  locally owned restaurants including Jack Fry s  Ramsi s

Corbin  though the first franchised KFC was located in South Salt Lake  Utah   10 3  Sports  Kentucky is the home of several sports teams such as Minor League Baseball s Triple A Louisville Bats and Class A Lexington Legends and the Class A Bowling Green Hot Rods  They are also home to the Frontier Leagues Florence Freedom and several teams in the MCFL  The Lexington Horsemen and Louisville Fire
