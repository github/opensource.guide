Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System  with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days  Seen from Earth  it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days  which is much faster than any other planet  It has no known natural satellites  The planet is named after the Roman deity Mercury  the messenger to the gods   Because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat  Mercury s surface experiences the greatest temperature variation of all the planets  ranging from at night to during the day at some equatorial regions  The poles are constantly below   Mercury s axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System s planets  about of a degree   but it has the largest orbital eccentricity  As such it does not experience seasons in the same way as most other planets such as Earth  At aphelion  Mercury is about 1 5 times as far from the Sun as it is at perihelion  Mercury s surface is heavily cratered and similar in appearance to the Moon  indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years   Mercury is gravitationally locked and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System  As seen relative to the fixed stars  it rotates exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around its orbit  As seen from the Sun  in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion  it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years  An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years   Because Mercury moves in an orbit around the Sun that lies within Earth s orbit  as does Venus   it can appear in Earth s sky in the morning or the evening  but not in the middle of the night  Also  like Venus and the Moon  it displays a complete range of phases as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth  Although Mercury can appear as a bright object when viewed from Earth  its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus  Two spacecraft have visited Mercury  Mariner 10 flew by in the 1970s and MESSENGER  launched in 2004  remains in orbit   1  Internal structure  Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System  and is a rocky body like Earth  It is the smallest planet in the Solar System  with an equatorial radius of   Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System  Ganymede and Titan  Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material  Mercury s density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5 427 g cm3  only slightly less than Earth s density of 5 515 g cm3  If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out  the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser  with an uncompressed density of 5 3 g cm3 versus Earth s 4 4 g cm3   Mercury s density can be used to infer details of its inner structure  Although Earth s high density results appreciably from gravitational compression  particularly at the core  Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed  Therefore  for it to have such a high density  its core must be large and rich in iron   Geologists estimate that Mercury s core occupies about 42% of its volume  for Earth this proportion is 17%  Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten core  Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km mantle consisting of silicates  Based on data from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth based observation  Mercury s crust is believed to be 100–300 km thick  One distinctive feature of Mercury s surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges  extending up to several hundred kilometers in length  It is believed that these were formed as Mercury s core and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified   Mercury s core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System  and several theories have been proposed to explain this  The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites  thought to be typical of the Solar System s rocky matter  and a mass approximately 2 25 times its current mass  Early in the Solar System s history  Mercury may have been struck by a planetesimal of approximately 1 6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across  The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle  leaving the core behind as a relatively major component  A similar process  known as the giant impact hypothesis  has been proposed to explain the formation of the Moon   Alternatively  Mercury may have formed from the solar nebula before the Sun s energy output had stabilized  It would initially have had twice its present mass  but as the protosun contracted  temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2 500 and 3 500 K and possibly even as high as 10 000 K  Much of Mercury s surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures  forming an atmosphere of  rock vapor  that could have been carried away by the solar wind   A third hypothesis proposes that the solar nebula caused drag on the particles from which Mercury was accreting  which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material and not gathered by Mercury  Each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition  and two space missions  MESSENGER and BepiColombo  both will make observations to test them  MESSENGER has found higher than expected potassium and sulfur levels on the surface  suggesting that the giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and mantle did not occur because potassium and sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these events  The findings would seem to favor the third hypothesis  however  further analysis of the data is needed   2  Surface geology  Mercury s surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon  showing extensive mare like plains and heavy cratering  indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years  Because our knowledge of Mercury s geology has been based only on the 1975 Mariner flyby and terrestrial observations  it is the least understood of the terrestrial planets  As data from the recent MESSENGER flyby is processed  this knowledge will increase  For example  an unusual crater with radiating troughs has been discovered that scientists called  the spider   It later received the name Apollodorus   Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity  as seen by telescopic observation  Mercury possesses dorsa  also called  wrinkle ridges    Moon like highlands  montes  mountains   planitiae  plains   rupes  escarpments   and valles  valleys    Names for features on Mercury come from a variety of sources  Names coming from people are limited to the deceased  Craters are named for artists  musicians  painters  and authors who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field  Ridges  or dorsa  are named for scientists who have contributed to the study of Mercury  Depressions or fossae are named for works of architecture  Montes are named for the word  hot  in a variety of languages  Plains or planitiae are named for Mercury in various languages  Escarpments or rupēs are named for ships of scientific expeditions  Valleys or valles are named for radio telescope facilities   Mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its formation 4 6 billion years ago  as well as during a possibly separate subsequent episode called the late heavy bombardment that came to an end 3 8 billion years ago  During this period of intense crater formation  the planet received impacts over its entire surface  facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down  During this time the planet was volcanically active  basins such as the Caloris Basin were filled by magma  producing smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon   Data from the October 2008 flyby of MESSENGER gave researchers a greater appreciation for the jumbled nature of Mercury s surface  Mercury s surface is more heterogeneous than either Mars s or the Moon s  both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology  such as maria and plateaus   2 1  Impact basins and craters  Craters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl shaped cavities to multi ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across  They appear in all states of degradation  from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants  Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller  a consequence of Mercury s stronger surface gravity  According to IAU rules  each new crater must be named after an artist that was famous for more than fifty years  and dead for more than three years  before the date the crater is named   The largest known crater is   with a diameter of 1 550 km  The impact that created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2 km tall surrounding the impact crater  At the antipode of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual  hilly terrain known as the  Weird Terrain   One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around the planet  converging at the basin s antipode  180 degrees away   The resulting high stresses fractured the surface  Alternatively  it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin s antipode   Overall  about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury  A notable basin is the 400 km wide  multi ring Tolstoj Basin that has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials  Beethoven Basin has a similar sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim  Like the Moon  the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of space weathering processes  including Solar wind and micrometeorite impacts   2 2  Plains  There are two geologically distinct plains regions on Mercury  Gently rolling  hilly plains in the regions between craters are Mercury s oldest visible surfaces  predating the heavily cratered terrain  These inter crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters  and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30 km in diameter  It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin  The inter crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet   Smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria  Notably  they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin  Unlike lunar maria  the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter crater plains  Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics  the localisation and rounded  lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins  All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin  as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket  The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain  broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern  It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact  or a large sheet of impact melt   One unusual feature of the planet s surface is the numerous compression folds  or rupes  that crisscross the plains  As the planet s interior cooled  it may have contracted and its surface began to deform  creating these features  The folds can be seen on top of other features  such as craters and smoother plains  indicating that the folds are more recent  Mercury s surface is flexed by significant tidal bulges raised by the Sun—the Sun s tides on Mercury are about 17 times stronger than the Moon s on Earth   3  Surface conditions and  atmosphere   exosphere   The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 K to 700 K at the most extreme places  0°N  0°W  or 180°W  It never rises above 180 K at the poles  due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature gradient between the equator and the poles  The subsolar point reaches about 700 K during perihelion  0°W or 180°W   but only 550 K at aphelion  90° or 270°W   On the dark side of the planet  temperatures average 110 K  The intensity of sunlight on Mercury s surface ranges between 4 59 and 10 61 times the solar constant  1 370 W·m−2    Although the daylight temperature at the surface of Mercury is generally extremely high  observations strongly suggest that ice  frozen water  exists on Mercury  The floors of deep craters at the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight  and temperatures there remain below 102 K  far lower than the global average  Water ice strongly reflects radar  and observations by the 70 m Goldstone telescope and the VLA in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar reflection near the poles  Although ice was not the only possible cause of these reflective regions  astronomers believed it was the most likely   The icy regions are believed to contain about 1014–1015 kg of ice  and may be covered by a layer of regolith that inhibits sublimation  By comparison  the Antarctic ice sheet on Earth has a mass of about 4 kg  and Mars s south polar cap contains about 1016 kg of water  The origin of the ice on Mercury is not yet known  but the two most likely sources are from outgassing of water from the planet s interior or deposition by impacts of comets   Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time  it does have a  tenuous surface bounded exosphere  containing hydrogen  helium  oxygen  sodium  calcium  potassium and others  This exosphere is not stable—atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources  Hydrogen and helium atoms probably come from the solar wind  diffusing into Mercury s magnetosphere before later escaping back into space  Radioactive decay of elements within Mercury s crust is another source of helium  as well as sodium and potassium  MESSENGER found high proportions of calcium  helium  hydroxide  magnesium  oxygen  potassium  silicon and sodium  Water vapor is present  released by a combination of processes such as  comets striking its surface  sputtering creating water out of hydrogen from the solar wind and oxygen from rock  and sublimation from reservoirs of water ice in the permanently shadowed polar craters  The detection of high amounts of water related ions like O+  OH−  and H2O+ was a surprise  Because of the quantities of these ions that were detected in Mercury s space environment  scientists surmise that these molecules were blasted from the surface or exosphere by the solar wind   Sodium  potassium and calcium were discovered in the atmosphere during the 1980–1990s  and are believed to result primarily from the vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts including presently from Comet Encke  In 2008 magnesium was discovered by MESSENGER probe  Studies indicate that  at times  sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to the planet s magnetic poles  This would indicate an interaction between the magnetosphere and the planet s surface   On November 29  2012  NASA confirmed that images from MESSENGER had detected that craters at the north pole contained water ice  Sean C  Solomon was quoted in the New York Times as estimating the volume of the ice as large enough to  encase Washington  D C   in a frozen block two and a half miles deep    4  Magnetic field and magnetosphere  Despite its small size and slow 59 day long rotation  Mercury has a significant  and apparently global  magnetic field  According to measurements taken by   it is about 1 1% as strong as Earth s  The magnetic field strength at the Mercurian equator is about   Like that of Earth  Mercury s magnetic field is dipolar  Unlike Earth  Mercury s poles are nearly aligned with the planet s spin axis  Measurements from both the and MESSENGER space probes have indicated that the strength and shape of the magnetic field are stable   It is likely that this magnetic field is generated by way of a dynamo effect  in a manner similar to the magnetic field of Earth  This dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planet s iron rich liquid core  Particularly strong tidal effects caused by the planet s high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep the core in the liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect   Mercury s magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet  creating a magnetosphere  The planet s magnetosphere  though small enough to fit within Earth  is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma  This contributes to the space weathering of the planet s surface  Observations taken by the spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet s nightside  Bursts of energetic particles were detected in the planet s magnetotail  which indicates a dynamic quality to the planet s magnetosphere   During its second flyby of the planet on October 6  2008  MESSENGER discovered that Mercury s magnetic field can be extremely  leaky   The spacecraft encountered magnetic  tornadoes  – twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space – that were up to wide or a third of the radius of the planet  These  tornadoes  form when magnetic fields carried by the solar wind connect to Mercury s magnetic field  As the solar wind blows past Mercury s field  these joined magnetic fields are carried with it and twist up into vortex like structures  These twisted magnetic flux tubes  technically known as flux transfer events  form open windows in the planet s magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury s surface   The process of linking interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields  called magnetic reconnection  is common throughout the cosmos  It occurs in Earth s magnetic field  where it generates magnetic tornadoes as well  The MESSENGER observations show the reconnection rate is ten times higher at Mercury  Mercury s proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER   5  Orbit  rotation  and longitude  Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets  its eccentricity is 0 21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from   It takes 87 969 Earth days to complete an orbit  The diagram on the right illustrates the effects of the eccentricity  showing Mercury s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi major axis  Mercury s higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5 day interval  In the diagram the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet  which is inversely proportional to Mercury s distance from the Sun  This varying distance to the Sun  combined with a 3 2 spin–orbit resonance of the planet s rotation around its axis  result in complex variations of the surface temperature  This resonance makes a single day on Mercury last exactly two Mercury years  or about 176 Earth days   Mercury s orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth s orbit  the ecliptic   as shown in the diagram on the right  As a result  transits of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between Earth and the Sun  This occurs about every seven years on average   Mercury s axial tilt is almost zero  with the best measured value as low as 0 027 degrees  This is significantly smaller than that of Jupiter  which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3 1 degrees  This means that to an observer at Mercury s poles  the center of the Sun never rises more than 2 1 arcminutes above the horizon   At certain points on Mercury s surface  an observer would be able to see the Sun rise about halfway  then reverse and set before rising again  all within the same Mercurian day  This is because approximately four Earth days before perihelion  Mercury s angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity so that the Sun s apparent motion ceases  closer to perihelion  Mercury s angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity  Thus  to a hypothetical observer on Mercury  the Sun appears to move in a retrograde direction  Four Earth days after perihelion  the Sun s normal apparent motion resumes   For the same reason  there are two points on Mercury s equator  180 degrees apart in longitude  at either of which  around perihelion in alternate Mercurian years  once a Mercurian day   the Sun passes overhead  then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again  then reverses a second time and passes overhead a third time  taking a total of about 16 Earth days for this entire process  In the other alternate Mercurian years  the same thing happens at the other of these two points  The amplitude of the retrograde motion is small  so the overall effect is that  for two or three weeks  the Sun is almost stationary overhead  and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion  its closest to the Sun  This prolonged exposure to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury  Conversely  there are two other points on the equator  90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones  where the Sun passes overhead only when the planet is at aphelion in alternate years  when the apparent motion of the Sun in the Mercurian sky is relatively rapid  These points  which are the ones on the equator where the apparent retrograde motion of the Sun happens when it is crossing the horizon as described in the preceding paragraph  receive much less solar heat than the first ones described above   Mercury attains inferior conjunction  nearest approach to Earth  every 116 Earth days on average  but this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to the planet s eccentric orbit  Mercury can come as near as 82 2 Gm to Earth  and that is slowly declining  The next approach to within 82 1 Gm is in 2679  and to within 82 Gm in 4487  but it will not be closer to Earth than 80 Gm until AD 28 622  Its period of retrograde motion as seen from Earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on either side of inferior conjunction  This large range arises from the planet s high orbital eccentricity   5 1  Longitude convention  The longitude convention for Mercury puts the zero of longitude at one of the two hottest points on the surface  as described above  However  when this area was first visited  by Mariner 10  this zero meridian was in darkness  so it was impossible to select a feature on the surface to define the exact position of the meridian  Therefore  a small crater further west was chosen  called Hun Kal  which provides the exact reference point for measuring longitude  The center of Hun Kal defines the 20° West meridian  A 1970 International Astronomical Union resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in the westerly direction on Mercury  The two hottest places on the equator are therefore at longitudes 0°W and 180°W  and the coolest points on the equator are at longitudes 90°W and 270°W  However the MESSENGER project uses an east positive convention   5 2  Spin–orbit resonance  For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously tidally locked with the Sun  rotating once for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the Sun  in the same way that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth  Radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3 2 spin–orbit resonance  rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun  the eccentricity of Mercury s orbit makes this resonance stable—at perihelion  when the solar tide is strongest  the Sun is nearly still in Mercury s sky   The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that  whenever Mercury was best placed for observation  it was always nearly at the same point in its 3 2 resonance  hence showing the same face  This is because  coincidentally  Mercury s rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth  Due to Mercury s 3 2 spin–orbit resonance  a solar day  the length between two meridian transits of the Sun  lasts about 176 Earth days  A sidereal day  the period of rotation  lasts about 58 7 Earth days   Simulations indicate that the orbital eccentricity of Mercury varies chaotically from nearly zero  circular  to more than 0 45 over millions of years due to perturbations from the other planets  This is thought to explain Mercury s 3 2 spin–orbit resonance  rather than the more usual 1 1   because this state is more likely to arise during a period of high eccentricity  Numerical simulations show that a future secular orbital resonant perihelion interaction with Jupiter may cause the eccentricity of Mercury s orbit to increase to the point where there is a 1% chance that the planet may collide with Venus within the next five billion years   5 3  Advance of perihelion  In 1859  the French mathematician and astronomer Urbain Le Verrier reported that the slow precession of Mercury s orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets  He suggested  among possible explanations  that another planet  or perhaps instead a series of smaller  corpuscules   might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury  to account for this perturbation   Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun   The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation  and the hypothetical planet was named Vulcan  but no such planet was ever found   The perihelion precession of Mercury is 5600 arcseconds  1 5556°  per century relative to Earth  or 574 10±0 65 arcseconds per century relative to the inertial ICFR  Newtonian mechanics  taking into account all the effects from the other planets  predicts a precession of 5557 arcseconds  1 5436°  per century  In the early 20th century  Albert Einstein s General Theory of Relativity provided the explanation for the observed precession  The effect is small  the Mercurian relativistic perihelion advance excess is just 42 98 arcseconds per century  therefore  it requires a little over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn  Similar  but much smaller  effects operate for other planets  8 62 arcseconds per century for Venus  3 84 for Earth  1 35 for Mars  and 10 05 for 1566 Icarus   6  Observation  Mercury s apparent magnitude varies between −2 6  brighter than the brightest star Sirius  and about +5 7  approximating the theoretical limit of naked eye visibility   The extremes occur when Mercury is close to the Sun in the sky  Observation of Mercury is complicated by its proximity to the Sun  as it is lost in the Sun s glare for much of the time  Mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight   Mercury can  like several other planets and the brightest stars  be seen during a total solar eclipse   Like the Moon and Venus  Mercury exhibits phases as seen from Earth  It is  new  at inferior conjunction and  full  at superior conjunction  The planet is rendered invisible from Earth on both of these occasions because of its being obscured by the Sun s disk   Mercury is technically brightest as seen from Earth when it is at a full phase  Although the planet is farthest away from Earth when it is full the greater illuminated area that is visible and the opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance  The opposite is true for Venus  which appears brightest when it is a crescent  because it is much closer to Earth than when gibbous   Nonetheless  the brightest  full phase  appearance of Mercury is an essentially impossible time for practical observation  because of the extreme proximity of the Sun  Mercury is best observed at the first and last quarter  although they are phases of lesser brightness  The first and last quarter phases occur at greatest elongation east and west  respectively  At both of these times Mercury s separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17 9° at perihelion to 27 8° at aphelion  At greatest elongation west  Mercury rises at its earliest before the Sun  and at greatest elongation east  it sets at its latest after the Sun   At tropical and subtropical latitudes  Mercury is more easily seen than at higher latitudes  In low latitudes and at the right times of year  the ecliptic intersects the horizon at a steep angle  When Mercury is vertically above the Sun in the sky and is at maximum elongation from the Sun  28 degrees   and when the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon  so the sky is just completely dark  Mercury is 10 degrees above the horizon  This is the greatest angle of elevation at which Mercury can be seen in a completely dark sky   At temperate latitudes  Mercury is more often easily visible from Earth s Southern Hemisphere than from its Northern Hemisphere  This is because Mercury s maximum possible elongations west of the Sun always occur when it is early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere  whereas its maximum possible eastern elongations happen during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere  In both of these cases  the angle Mercury strikes with the ecliptic is maximized  allowing it to rise several hours before the Sun in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter in countries located at southern temperate zone latitudes  such as Argentina and South Africa  By contrast  at the major population centers of the northern temperate latitudes  Mercury is never above the horizon during the hours of night   An alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear  ideally when it is at its point of greatest elongation  This allows the planet to be found easily  even when using telescopes with 8 cm apertures  Care must be taken to ensure the instrument isn t pointed directly towards the Sun because of the risk for eye damage  This method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation  e g  on autumn evenings    Ground based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail  The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10  which mapped about 45% of its surface from 1974 to 1975  The second is the MESSENGER spacecraft  which after three Mercury flybys between 2008 and 2009  attained orbit around Mercury on March 17  2011  to study and map the rest of the planet   The Hubble Space Telescope cannot observe Mercury at all  due to safety procedures that prevent its pointing too close to the Sun   6 1  Naked eye viewing  At the right times  and from the right latitudes on Earth  Mercury is easy to see  although many casual observers search for it without success  Mercury is seen most easily when it is close to its greatest elongation  which means that its angular separation from the Sun is greatest  Mercury can be near greatest western elongation  which means it is west of the Sun in the sky  so it is visible soon before sunrise  or greatest eastern elongation  which means it is visible soon after sunset  However  the exact dates of the greatest elongations are not the best ones on which to try to see Mercury  The phase of the planet greatly affects its apparent brightness  At greatest elongation  it is approximately at half phase  It is brighter when it is gibbous  which means that the best times to see Mercury are a few days before greatest eastern elongation  in the evening  or a few days after greatest western elongation  in the morning  The apparent inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon is also important  When the inclination is large  as occurs near the spring equinox in the evening  and near the autumnal equinox in the morning  this is true for observers in both hemispheres   Mercury is higher in the sky when the Sun is just below the horizon  which makes it easier to see than at other times  The inclination of the ecliptic is also greater for observers at low latitudes than high ones  It is helpful if Mercury is close to aphelion at the time of observation  because this makes it further from the Sun than at other times  However  it also makes the planet less brightly illuminated  so the visibility advantage is not great  At present  Mercury is fairly close to aphelion when viewed at greatest western elongation at the March equinox  or at greatest eastern elongation at the September equinox   Over long periods of time  this changes as Mercury s orbit shifts    Putting all these factors together  the best time for an observer in the Southern Hemisphere to see Mercury is in the morning  near the March equinox  a few days after Mercury is at greatest western elongation  or in the evening  near the September equinox  a few days before greatest eastern elongation  An observer in the Northern Hemisphere cannot optimize all the factors simultaneously  Usually  the best chances of seeing the planet are in the evening  near the March equinox  a few days before greatest eastern elongation  or in the morning  near the September equinox  a few days after greatest western elongation  The inclination of the ecliptic is then large  but Mercury is not close to aphelion   Mercury s period of revolution around the Sun is 88 days  It therefore makes about 4 15 revolutions around the Sun in one Earth year  In successive years the position of Mercury on its orbit therefore shifts by 0 15 revolutions when seen on specific dates  such as the equinoxes  Therefore  if  for example  greatest eastern elongation happens on the March equinox of some year  about three years later greatest western elongation will happen near the March equinox  because the position of Mercury on its orbit at the equinox will have changed by about half   45  a revolution  Thus  if the timings of elongations and equinoxes are unfavourable for observing Mercury in some year  they will be fairly favourable within about three years later  Furthermore  because the shift of 0 15 revolutions in a year makes up a seven year cycle  0 15 × 7 ≈ 1 0   in the seventh year Mercury will follows almost exactly  earlier by 7 days  the sequence of phenomena it showed seven years before   7  Observation history  7 1  Ancient astronomers  The earliest known recorded observations of Mercury are from the Mul Apin tablets  These observations were most likely made by an Assyrian astronomer around the 14th century BC  The cuneiform name used to designate Mercury on the Mul Apin tablets is transcribed as Udu Idim Gu\u4 Ud   the jumping planet    Babylonian records of Mercury date back to the 1st millennium BC  The Babylonians called the planet Nabu after the messenger to the gods in their mythology   The ancient Greeks knew the planet as Στίλβων  Stilbon   meaning  the gleaming   Ἑρμάων  Hermaon  and Ἑρμής  Hermes   a planetary name that is retained in modern Greek  Ερμής  Ermis   The Romans named the planet after the swift footed Roman messenger god  Mercury  Latin Mercurius   which they equated with the Greek Hermes  because it moves across the sky faster than any other planet  The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes  caduceus   The Roman Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy wrote about the possibility of planetary transits across the face of the Sun in his work Planetary Hypotheses  He suggested that no transits had been observed either because planets such as Mercury were too small to see  or because the transits were too infrequent   In ancient China  Mercury was known as Chen Xing     the Hour Star  It was associated with the direction north and the phase of water in the Wu Xing  Modern Chinese  Korean  Japanese and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the  water star      based on the Five elements  Hindu mythology used the name Budha for Mercury  and this god was thought to preside over Wednesday  The god Odin  or Woden  of Germanic paganism was associated with the planet Mercury and Wednesday  The Maya may have represented Mercury as an owl  or possibly four owls  two for the morning aspect and two for the evening  that served as a messenger to the underworld   The ancient association of Mercury with Wednesday is still visible in the names of Wednesday in various modern languages of Latin descent  e g  mercredi in French  miércoles in Spanish  or miercuri in Romanian  The names of the days of the week were  in late classical times  all related to the names of the seven bodies that were then considered to be planets   In ancient Indian astronomy  the Surya Siddhanta  an Indian astronomical text of the 5th century  estimates the diameter of Mercury as   an error of less than 1% from the accepted diameter of   This estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet s angular diameter as 3 0 arcminutes  50 millidegrees    In medieval Islamic astronomy  the Andalusian astronomer Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al Zarqālī in the 11th century described the deferent of Mercury s geocentric orbit as being oval  like an egg or a pignon  although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his astronomical calculations  In the 12th century  Ibn Bajjah observed  two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun   which was later suggested as the transit of Mercury and or Venus by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al Din Shirazi in the 13th century   Note that most such medieval reports of transits were later taken as observations of sunspots    In India  the Kerala school astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in the 15th century developed a partially heliocentric planetary model in which Mercury orbits the Sun  which in turn orbits Earth  similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century   7 2  Ground based telescopic research  The first telescopic observations of Mercury were made by Galileo in the early 17th century  Although he observed phases when he looked at Venus  his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phases of Mercury  In 1631  Pierre Gassendi made the first telescopic observations of the transit of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by Johannes Kepler  In 1639  Giovanni Zupi used a telescope to discover that the planet had orbital phases similar to Venus and the Moon  The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited around the Sun   A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another  occultation   as seen from Earth  Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries  and the event of May 28  1737 is the only one historically observed  having been seen by John Bevis at the Royal Greenwich Observatory  The next occultation of Mercury by Venus will be on December 3  2133   The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury mean that it has been far less studied than the other planets  In 1800  Johann Schröter made observations of surface features  claiming to have observed 20 km high mountains  Friedrich Bessel used Schröter s drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70°  In the 1880s  Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped the planet more accurately  and suggested that Mercury s rotational period was 88 days  the same as its orbital period due to tidal locking  This phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation  The effort to map the surface of Mercury was continued by Eugenios Antoniadi  who published a book in 1934 that included both maps and his own observations  Many of the planet s surface features  particularly the albedo features  take their names from Antoniadi s map   In June 1962  Soviet scientists at the Institute of Radio engineering and Electronics of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by Vladimir Kotelnikov became first to bounce radar signal off Mercury and receive it  starting radar observations of the planet  Three years later radar observations by Americans Gordon Pettengill and R  Dyce using 300 meter Arecibo Observatory radio telescope in Puerto Rico showed conclusively that the planet s rotational period was about 59 days  The theory that Mercury s rotation was synchronous had become widely held  and it was a surprise to astronomers when these radio observations were announced  If Mercury were tidally locked  its dark face would be extremely cold  but measurements of radio emission revealed that it was much hotter than expected  Astronomers were reluctant to drop the synchronous rotation theory and proposed alternative mechanisms such as powerful heat distributing winds to explain the observations   Italian astronomer Giuseppe Colombo noted that the rotation value was about two thirds of Mercury s orbital period  and proposed that the planet s orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 3 2 rather than a 1 1 resonance  Data from Mariner 10 subsequently confirmed this view  This means that Schiaparelli s and Antoniadi s maps were not  wrong   Instead  the astronomers saw the same features during every second orbit and recorded them  but disregarded those seen in the meantime  when Mercury s other face was toward the Sun  because the orbital geometry meant that these observations were made under poor viewing conditions   Ground based optical observations did not shed much further light on the innermost planet  but radio astronomers using interferometry at microwave wavelengths  a technique that enables removal of the solar radiation  were able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the subsurface layers to a depth of several meters  Not until the first space probe flew past Mercury did many of its most fundamental morphological properties become known  Moreover  recent technological advances have led to improved ground based observations  In 2000  high resolution lucky imaging observations were conducted by the Mount Wilson Observatory 1 5 meter Hale telescope  They provided the first views that resolved surface features on the parts of Mercury that were not imaged in the Mariner mission  Most of the planet has been mapped by the Arecibo radar telescope  with 5 km resolution  including polar deposits in shadowed craters of what may be water ice   7 3  Research with space probes  Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges  because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than Earth  A Mercury bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over 91 million kilometers into the Sun s gravitational potential well  Mercury has an orbital speed of 48 km s  whereas Earth s orbital speed is 30 km s  Thus the spacecraft must make a large change in velocity  delta v  to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit that passes near Mercury  as compared to the delta v required for other planetary missions   The potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun s potential well becomes kinetic energy  requiring another large delta v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury  To land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft would rely entirely on rocket motors  Aerobraking is ruled out because the planet has little atmosphere  A trip to Mercury requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the Solar System completely  As a result  only two space probes have visited the planet so far  A proposed alternative approach would use a solar sail to attain a Mercury synchronous orbit around the Sun   7 3 1  Mariner 10  The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA s Mariner 10  1974–1975   The spacecraft used the gravity of Venus to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach Mercury  making it both the first spacecraft to use this gravitational  slingshot  effect and the first NASA mission to visit multiple planets  Mariner 10 provided the first close up images of Mercury s surface  which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature  and revealed many other types of geological features  such as the giant scarps that were later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools  Unfortunately  due to the length of Mariner 10 s orbital period  the same face of the planet was lit at each of Mariner 10 s close approaches  This made observation of both sides of the planet impossible  and resulted in the mapping of less than 45% of the planet s surface   On March 27  1974  two days before its first flyby of Mercury  Mariner 10 s instruments began registering large amounts of unexpected ultraviolet radiation near Mercury  This led to the tentative identification of Mercury s moon  Shortly afterward  the source of the excess UV was identified as the star 31 Crateris  and Mercury s moon passed into astronomy s history books as a footnote   The spacecraft made three close approaches to Mercury  the closest of which took it to within 327 km of the surface  At the first close approach  instruments detected a magnetic field  to the great surprise of planetary geologists—Mercury s rotation was expected to be much too slow to generate a significant dynamo effect  The second close approach was primarily used for imaging  but at the third approach  extensive magnetic data were obtained  The data revealed that the planet s magnetic field is much like Earth s  which deflects the solar wind around the planet  The origin of Mercury s magnetic field is still the subject of several competing theories   On March 24  1975  just eight days after its final close approach  Mariner 10 ran out of fuel  Because its orbit could no longer be accurately controlled  mission controllers instructed the probe to shut down  Mariner 10 is thought to be still orbiting the Sun  passing close to Mercury every few months   7 3 2  MESSENGER  A second NASA mission to Mercury  named MESSENGER  MErcury Surface  Space ENvironment  GEochemistry  and Ranging   was launched on August 3  2004  from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Boeing Delta 2 rocket  It made a fly by of Earth in August 2005  and of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around Mercury  A first fly by of Mercury occurred on January 14  2008  a second on October 6  2008  and a third on September 29  2009  Most of the hemisphere not imaged by Mariner 10 has been mapped during these fly bys  The probe successfully entered an elliptical orbit around the planet on March 18  2011  The first orbital image of Mercury was obtained on March 29  2011  The probe finished a one year mapping mission  and then entered a one year extended mission into 2013  In addition to continued observations and mapping of Mercury  MESSENGER observed the 2012 solar maximum   The mission is designed to clear up six key issues  Mercury s high density  its geological history  the nature of its magnetic field  the structure of its core  whether it has ice at its poles  and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from  To this end  the probe is carrying imaging devices that will gather much higher resolution images of much more of the planet than Mariner 10  assorted spectrometers to determine abundances of elements in the crust  and magnetometers and devices to measure velocities of charged particles  Detailed measurements of tiny changes in the probe s velocity as it orbits will be used to infer details of the planet s interior structure   7 3 3  Curiosity rover  On June 3  2014  the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun  marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth   7 3 4  BepiColombo  The European Space Agency is planning a joint mission with Japan called BepiColombo  which will orbit Mercury with two probes  one to map the planet and the other to study its magnetosphere  Once launched in 2015  the spacecraft bus is expected to reach Mercury in 2019  The bus will release a magnetometer probe into an elliptical orbit  then chemical rockets will fire to deposit the mapper probe into a circular orbit  Both probes will operate for a terrestrial year  The mapper probe will carry an array of spectrometers similar to those on MESSENGER  and will study the planet at many different wavelengths including infrared  ultraviolet  X ray and gamma ray   8  Comparison  9  See also  Colonization of
