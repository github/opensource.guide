An Object Modeling Language is a standardized set of symbols used to model a software system using an object oriented framework  The symbols can be either informal or formal ranging from predefined graphical templates to formal object models defined by grammars and specifications   A modeling language is usually associated with a methodology for object oriented development  The modeling language defines the elements of the model  E g   that a model has classes  methods  object properties  etc  The methodology defines the steps developers and users need to take to develop and maintain a software system  Steps such as Define requirements  Develop code  and Test system  It is common to equate the modeling language and the modeling methodology  For example the Booch method may refer to Grady Booch s standard for diagramming  his methodology  or both  Or the Rumbaugh Object Modeling Technique is both a set of diagrams and a process model for developing object oriented systems   In the early years of the object oriented community there were several competing modeling and methodology standards  Booch and Rumbaugh were two of the most popular  Ivar Jacobson s Objectory  Shlaer Mellor and Yourdon Coad were also popular   However  the object oriented community values re use and standardization  As shown in the graphic there were efforts starting in the mid  90 s to reconcile the leading models and focus on one unified specification  The graphic shows the evolution of one of the most important object modeling language standards  the Unified Modeling Language  UML    The UML began as an attempt by some of the major thought leaders in the community to define a standard language at the OOPSLA  95 Conference  Originally  Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh merged their models into a unified model  This was followed by Booch s company Rational Software purchasing Ivar Jacobson s Objectory company and merging their model into the UML  At the time Rational and Objectory were two of the dominant players in the small world of independent vendors of Object Oriented tools and methods   The Object Management Group then picked up and took over ownership of the UML  The OMG is one of the most influential standards organizations in the object oriented world  The UML is both a formal metamodel and a collection of graphical templates  The meta model defines the elements in an object oriented model such as classes and properties  It is essentially the same thing as the meta model in object oriented languages such as Smalltalk or CLOS  However  in those cases the meta model is meant primarily to be used by developers at run time to dynamically inspect and modify an application object model  The UML meta model provides a mathematical formal foundation for the various graphic views used by the modeling language to describe an emerging system   The following diagram illustrates the class hierarchy of the various graphic templates defined by the UML  Structure diagrams define the static structure of an object  its place in the class hierarchy  its relation to other objects  etc  Behavior diagrams specify the dynamic aspects of the model  business process logic  coordination and timing of distributed objects  etc   1  References
