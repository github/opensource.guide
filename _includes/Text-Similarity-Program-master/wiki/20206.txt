Manchester    is a city in North West England with a population of 514 417 in 2013  In the United Kingdom s second most populous urban area  which has a population of 2 55 million  Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south  the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation  The local authority is Manchester City Council   The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium  a variant of which name is preserved by the city s demonym  residents are still referred to as Mancunians     The Roman fort was established around  79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell  Historically part of Lancashire  although areas of Cheshire  south of the River Mersey were incorporated into the city during the 20th century  Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand  at an astonishing rate  around the turn of the 19th century  Manchester s unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution  and resulted in it becoming the world s first industrialised city  The building of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761 built to transport coal triggered an early 19th century factory building boom which transformed Manchester from a township into a major mill town and borough that culminated in city status in 1853   thus becoming the first new British city in over 300 years  In 1877  Manchester Town Hall was built and in 1894 the Manchester Ship Canal  at the time the longest river navigation canal in the world  opened  creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to sea  Manchester s fortunes decreased after the Second World War due to deindustrialisation  However  investment spurred by the 1996 Manchester bombing led to extensive regeneration  particularly in the city centre   The city is notable for its architecture  culture  music scene  media links  scientific and engineering output  social impact  sports clubs and transport connections  Known through time as a hotbed for radical ideas  Manchester was the site of the world s first railway station and is where scientists first split the atom  and developed the first stored program computer  Manchester is also regarded as the birthplace of women s suffrage in the United Kingdom  and both capitalism and communism  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels began to write the Communist Manifesto at Chetham Library  the oldest public library in the English speaking world   Today Manchester is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network  Its metropolitan economy is the third largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $88 3bn  2012 est   PPP   Manchester is the third most visited city in the UK by foreign visitors  after London and Edinburgh   1  Name  The name Manchester originates from the Latin name Mamucium or its variant Mancunium  These are generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name  either from mamm    breast   in reference to a  breast like hill   or from mamma   mother   in reference to a local river goddess   Both meanings are preserved in languages derived from Common Brittonic  mam meaning  breast  in Irish and  mother  in Welsh  The suffix  chester is a survival of Old English ceaster   fort  fortified town     2  History  2 1  Early history  The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England  they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands  opposite the banks of the River Irwell  Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford  Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century  General Agricola ordered the construction of a fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix  Chester  and Eboracum  York  were protected from the Brigantes  Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time  A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in Castlefield  The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century  its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid 3rd century  although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century  After the Roman withdrawal and Saxon conquest  the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the Irwell and Irk sometime before the arrival of the Normans after 1066  Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent Harrying of the North   Thomas de la Warre  lord of the manor  founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish in 1421  The church is now Manchester Cathedral  the domestic premises of the college house Chetham s School of Music and Chetham s Library  The library  which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today  is the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom   Manchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282  Around the 14th century  Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers  sometimes credited as the foundation of the region s textile industry  Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen  and by about 1540  had expanded to become  in John Leland s words   The fairest  best builded  quickest  and most populous town of all Lancashire   The cathedral and Chetham s buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland s Manchester   During the English Civil War  Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest  Although not long lasting  Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP  Charles Worsley  who sat for the city for only a year  was later appointed Major General for Lancashire  Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals  He was a diligent puritan  turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas  he died in 1656   Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600  firstly in linen cotton fustians  but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance  The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736  opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey  The Bridgewater Canal  Britain s first wholly artificial waterway  was opened in 1761  bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester  The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776  The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton  Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns  A commodities exchange  opened in 1729  and numerous large warehouses  aided commerce  In 1780  Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester s first cotton mill  In the early 1800s  John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester   2 2  Industrial Revolution  Manchester s history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution  The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire  and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing  and later the world s largest marketplace for cotton goods  Manchester was dubbed  Cottonopolis  and  Warehouse City  during the Victorian era  In Australia  New Zealand and South Africa  the term  manchester  is still used for household linen  sheets  pillow cases  towels  etc  The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester s population   Manchester began expanding  at an astonishing rate  around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland  Wales  Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution  It developed a wide range of industries  so that by 1835  Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world   Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade  but diversified into general manufacture  Similarly  the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes  but expanded into other areas  Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance  Trade  and feeding the growing population  required a large transport and distribution infrastructure  the canal system was extended  and Manchester became one end of the world s first intercity passenger railway—the Liverpool and Manchester Railway  Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down  In 1878 the GPO  the forerunner of British Telecom  provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester   The Manchester Ship Canal was built in 1894  in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey  running from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey  This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester  On the canal s banks  just outside the borough  the world s first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park  Large quantities of machinery  including cotton processing plant  were exported around the world   A centre of capitalism  Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots  as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city s working and non titled classes  One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819  The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there  and Manchester was the centre of the Anti Corn Law League from 1838 onward   Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left wing politics  being the subject of Friedrich Engels  work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844  Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester  and when Karl Marx visited Manchester  they met at Chetham s Library  The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library  as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet  The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester  at the Mechanics  Institute  David Street   from 2 to 6 June 1868  Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement   At that time  it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes  new ways of thinking  the Manchester School  promoting free trade and laissez faire   new classes or groups in society  new religious sects  and new forms of labour organisation  It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe  A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today   What Manchester does today  the rest of the world does tomorrow   Manchester s golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century  Many of the great public buildings  including Manchester Town Hall  date from then  The city s cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture  which included the Hallé Orchestra  In 1889  when county councils were created in England  the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy   Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city  it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population  Historian Simon Schama noted that  Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes  a new kind of city in the world  the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke   An American visitor taken to Manchester’s blackspots saw  wretched  defrauded  oppressed  crushed human nature  lying and bleeding fragments    The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853  Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s  However  this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region  Manchester continued to process cotton  and in 1913  65% of the world s cotton was processed in the area  The First World War interrupted access to the export markets  Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased  often on machines produced in Manchester  Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries  including textile manufacture   2 3  Manchester Blitz  Like most of the UK  the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the Second World War  For example  casting and machining expertise at Beyer  Peacock and Company s locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making  Dunlop s rubber works in Chorlton on Medlock made barrage balloons  and just outside the city in Trafford Park  engineers Metropolitan Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls Royce Merlin engines to power them  Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe  and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non military targets  The biggest took place during the  Christmas Blitz  on the nights of 22 23 and 24 December 1940  when an estimated of high explosives plus over 37 000 incendiary bombs were dropped  A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed  including 165 warehouses  200 business premises  and 150 offices  376 were killed and 30 000 houses were damaged  Manchester Cathedral was among the buildings seriously damaged  its restoration took 20 years   2 4  Post Second World War  Cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime  and the exchange closed in 1968  By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK s third largest  and employed over 3 000 men  but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships  Traffic declined  and the port closed in 1982  Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher s government after 1979  Manchester lost 150 000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983   Regeneration began in the late 1980s  with initiatives such as the Metrolink  the Bridgewater Concert Hall  the Manchester Arena  and  in Salford  the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays  Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city   Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans  including the Manchester Martyrs of 1867  arson in 1920  a series of explosions in 1939  and two bombs in 1992  On Saturday 15 June 1996  the Provisional Irish Republican Army  IRA  carried out the 1996 Manchester bombing  the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre  The largest to be detonated on British soil  the bomb injured over 200 people  heavily damaged nearby buildings  and broke windows away  The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50 million  but this was quickly revised upwards  The final insurance payout was over £400 million  many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade   Spurred by the investment after the 1996 bomb  and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games  Manchester s city centre has undergone extensive regeneration  New and renovated complexes such as The Printworks and The Triangle have become popular shopping and entertainment destinations  The Manchester Arndale is the UK s largest city centre shopping centre   Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel  Old mills have been converted into modern apartments  Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration programmes  and million pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed  The 169 metre tall  47 storey Beetham Tower  completed in 2006  is the tallest building in the UK outside London and when finished was the highest residential accommodation in Europe  In January 2007  the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only supercasino in the UK  however plans were officially abandoned in February 2008   Since around the turn of the 21st century  Manchester has been regarded by sections of the international press  British public  and government ministers as being the second city of the United Kingdom  The BBC reports that redevelopment of recent years has heightened claims that Manchester is the second city of the UK  Manchester and Birmingham have traditionally been considered for this unofficial title   3  Government  The City of Manchester is governed by the Manchester City Council  The earlier Greater Manchester County Council was abolished in 1986 so it is effectively a unitary authority  Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995   The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301  but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359  Until the 19th century  local government was largely provided by manorial courts  the last of which ended in 1846   From a very early time  the township of Manchester lay within the historic or ceremonial county boundaries of Lancashire  Pevsner wrote  That  neighbouring  Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England   A stroke of a Norman baron s pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford  though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester  it was Manchester  with its humbler line of lords  that was separated from Salford  It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of Salfordshire  which included the ancient parish of Manchester  Manchester later formed its own Poor Law Union using the name  Manchester   In 1792  Commissioners—usually known as  Police Commissioners —were established for the social improvement of Manchester  Manchester regained its borough status in 1838  and comprised the townships of Beswick  Cheetham Hill  Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme  By 1846  with increasing population and greater industrialisation  the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the  Police Commissioners   In 1853  Manchester was granted  city status  in the United Kingdom   In 1885  Bradford  Harpurhey  Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester  In 1889  the city became a county borough as did many larger Lancashire towns  and therefore not governed by Lancashire County Council  Between 1890 and 1933  more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council  including former villages such as Burnage  Chorlton cum Hardy  Didsbury  Fallowfield  Levenshulme  Longsight  and Withington  In 1931  the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley  Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added  In 1974  by way of the Local Government Act 1972  the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester  That year  Ringway  the town where the Manchester Airport is located  was added to the City   In November 2014 it was announced that a new directly elected Mayor would control £1bn of public money  in a move described as  Devo Manc    4  Geography  At   northwest of London  Manchester lies in a bowl shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines  a mountain chain that runs the length of northern England  and to the south by the Cheshire Plain  The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell  near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk  and is relatively low lying  being between above sea level  The River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester  Much of the inner city  especially in the south  is flat  offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines  which can often be capped with snow in the winter months  Manchester s geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world s first industrial city  These features are its climate  its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool  the availability of water power from its rivers  and its nearby coal reserves  The name Manchester  though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester  has been applied to other  wider divisions of land  particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area  The  Manchester City Zone    Manchester post town  and the  Manchester Congestion Charge  are all examples of this   For purposes of the Office for National Statistics  Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area  the United Kingdom s third largest conurbation  There is a mixture of high density urban and suburban locations in Manchester  The largest open space in the city  at around   is Heaton Park  Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements  except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire  The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester  through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively  Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions  the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station   4 1  Climate  Manchester experiences a temperate Oceanic climate  like much of the British Isles  with cool summers and cool winters  There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year  The city s average annual rainfall is compared to the UK average of   and its mean rain days are 140 4 per annum  compared to the UK average of 154 4  Manchester however has a relatively high humidity level and this  along with the abundant supply of soft water  was one of the factors that led to the localisation of the textile industry in the area  Snowfalls are not common in the city  due to the urban warming effect  However  the Pennine and Rossendale Forest hills that surround the city to its east and north receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow  notably the A62 road via Oldham and Standedge  the A57  Snake Pass  towards Sheffield  and the M62 over Saddleworth Moor   5  Demography  Historically the population of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era  peaking at 766 311 in 1931  From then the population began to decrease rapidly  due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley   The 2012 Mid Year Estimate for the population of Manchester was 510 700  This was an increase of 7 900  or 1 6%  since the 2011 MYE  Since 2001  the population has grown by 87 900  or 20 8%  Manchester was the third fastest growing of the areas in the 2011 census  The city experienced the greatest percentage population growth outside London  with an increase of 19% to over 500 000  Manchester s population is projected to reach 532 200 by 2021  an increase of 5 8% from 2011  This represents a slower rate of growth than the previous decade   The Greater Manchester Built up Area had a population of 2 553 400  2011 est     An estimated 2 702 200 people live in Greater Manchester  2012 est     6 547 000 people live within of Manchester  2012 est     and 11 694 000 within  2012 est      Between the beginning of July 2011 and end of June 2012  Mid Year Estimate date   births exceeded deaths by 4 800  Migration  internal and international  and other changes accounted for a net increase of 3 100 people between July 2011 and June 2012  Compared to Greater Manchester and England  Manchester has a younger population  with a particularly large 20–35 age group   There were 76 095 under  and post graduate students at The Manchester Metropolitan University  The University of Manchester and Royal Northern College of Music during the academic year 2011 12   Since the 2001 census  the proportion of Christians in Manchester has decreased by 22% from 62 4% to 48 7%  The proportion of people with no religious affiliation increased by 58 1% from 16% to 25 3%  whilst the proportion of Muslims increased by 73 6% from 9 1% to 15 8%  The size of the Jewish population in Greater Manchester is the largest in Britain outside London   Manchester has a disproportionately high number of gay and lesbian people  Of all households in Manchester  0 23% were Same Sex Civil Partnership couple households  compared to the English national average of 0 16% in 2011   In terms of ethnic composition  the City of Manchester has the highest non white proportion of any district in Greater Manchester  Statistics from the 2011 census showed that 66 7% of the population was White  59 3% White British  2 4% White Irish  0 1% Gypsy or Irish Traveller  4 9% Other White – although those of mixed European and British ancestry is unknown

9% Arab and 1 2% of other ethnic heritage   Kidd identifies Moss Side  Longsight  Cheetham Hill  Rusholme  as centres of population for ethnic minorities  Manchester s Irish Festival  including a St Patrick s Day parade  is one of Europe s largest  There is also a well established Chinatown in the city with a substantial number of oriental restaurants and Chinese supermarkets  The area also attracts large numbers of Chinese students to the city who  in attending the local universities  contribute to Manchester having the third largest Chinese population in Europe   The Manchester Larger Urban Zone  a Eurostat measure of the functional city region approximated to local government districts  has a population of 2 539 100 in 2004  In addition to Manchester itself  the LUZ includes the remainder of the county of Greater Manchester  The Manchester LUZ is the second largest within the United Kingdom  behind that of London   6  Economy  The Office for National Statistics does not produce economic data for the City of Manchester alone  but includes four other metropolitan boroughs  Salford  Stockport  Tameside  Trafford  in an area named Greater Manchester South  which had a GVA of £34 8bn  The economy grew relatively strongly between 2002 and 2012  where growth was 2 3% above the national average  With a GDP of $88 3bn  2012 est   PPP  the wider metropolitan economy is the third largest in the United Kingdom  It is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network   As the UK economy continues to recover from the downturn experienced in 2008–10  Manchester compares favourably to other geographies according to the latest figures  In 2012 it is showed the strongest annual growth in business stock  5%  of all the Core Cities  The city experienced a relatively sharp increase in the number of business deaths  the largest increase of all the Core Cities  however this was offset by strong growth in new businesses which resulted in a strong net growth   Manchester s civic leadership has a reputation for business acumen  It owns two of the country s four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects  Meanwhile KPMG s competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world  and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city  it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment   KPMG s competitive alternative report also found that Manchester was Europe s most affordable city featured  ranking slightly better than Dutch cities  Rotterdam and Amsterdam  who all have a cost of living index less than 95   Manchester is a city of contrast  where some of the country s most deprived and most affluent neighbourhoods can be found  According to the 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation Manchester is the 4th most deprived local council in the England  Unemployment throughout 2012–13 averaged 11 9%  which was above the national average  but lower than some of the country s other comparable large cities  On the other hand  Greater Manchester is home to more multi millionaires than anywhere outside London  with the City of Manchester taking up most of the tally  In 2013 Manchester was ranked 6th in the UK for quality of life  according to a rating of the UK s 12 largest cities   Women fare better in Manchester than the rest of the country in terms of equal pay to men  The per hours worked gender pay gap is 3 3%  in contrast to 11 1% for Great Britain  37% of the working age population in Manchester have degree level qualifications in contrast to the average of 33% across other Core Cities  although schools under perform slightly when compared to the national average   Manchester has the largest UK office market outside London according to GVA Grimley with a quarterly average office uptake of approximately 230 000 square ft – more than the quarterly office uptake of Leeds  Liverpool and Newcastle combined and nearly 80 000 square feet more than the nearest rival Birmingham  The strong office market in Manchester has been partly attributed to  Northshoring    from offshoring  which entails the relocation or alternative creation of jobs away from the overheated South to areas where office space is possibly cheaper and workforce market may not be as saturated   7  Landmarks  Manchester s buildings display a variety of architectural styles  ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture  The widespread use of red brick characterises the city  Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade  Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former cotton mills  some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space  Manchester Town Hall  in Albert Square  was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England   Manchester also has a number of skyscrapers built during the 1960s and 1970s  the tallest of which was the CIS Tower located near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006  it is an example of the new surge in high rise building and includes a Hilton hotel  a restaurant  and apartments  On its completion  it was the tallest building in the UK outside London  although an even taller building  the Piccadilly Tower  began construction behind Manchester Piccadilly station in early 2008  a project in abeyance   The Green Building  opposite Oxford Road station  is a pioneering eco friendly housing project  while the recently completed One Angel Square  is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world  The award winning Heaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe  covering of parkland  The city has 135 parks  gardens  and open spaces   Two large squares hold many of Manchester s public monuments  Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert  Bishop James Fraser  Oliver Heywood  William Ewart Gladstone and John Bright

its war dead  The Alan Turing Memorial in Sackville Park commemorates his role as the father of modern computing  A larger than life statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square  having stood for many years in Platt Fields  was presented to the city by Mr  and Mrs  Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati  Ohio  to mark the part that Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861–1865  A Concorde is on display near Manchester Airport   Manchester has six designated Local Nature Reserves which are Chorlton Water Park  Blackley Forest  Clayton Vale and Chorlton Ees  Ivy Green  Boggart Hole Clough and Highfield Country Park   8  Transport  Manchester  Northern England and North Wales are served by Manchester Airport  The airport is the third busiest in the United Kingdom and the largest outside the London region  Airline services exist to many destinations in Europe  North America  the Caribbean  Africa  the Middle East and Asia  with more destinations from Manchester than any other airport in Britain   A second runway was opened in 2001 and there have been continued terminal improvements  The airport has the highest rating available   Category 10   encompassing an elite group of airports which are able to handle  Code F  aircraft including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 8  From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and the only UK airport other than Heathrow Airport to operate the Airbus A380   A smaller airfield  City Airport Manchester  also exists to the west of Manchester city centre  It was Manchester s first municipal airport  and became the site of the first Air traffic control tower in the UK  and the first municipal airfield in the UK to be to be licensed by the Air Ministry  Today  private charter flights and general aviation use the airfield  it also has a flight school  and both the Greater Manchester Police Air Support Unit and the North West Air Ambulance have helicopters based at the airfield   Manchester Liverpool Road was the world s first purpose built passenger and goods railway station  and served as the Manchester terminus on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway – the world s first inter city passenger railway  Today the city is well served by the rail network  and is at the centre of an extensive countywide railway network  including the West Coast Main Line  with two mainline stations  Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria  Being redeveloped   The Manchester station group – comprising Manchester Piccadilly  Manchester Victoria  Manchester Oxford Road and Deansgate – is the fourth busiest in the United Kingdom  with 41 7 million passengers recorded in 2013  On 7 February 2014  construction of the £600m Northern Hub project  which aims to increase capacity and reduce journey times across the North  began with construction work commencing on a 4th platform at Manchester Airport railway station  The High Speed 2 link to Birmingham and London is also planned  which  if built  will include a tunnel under Manchester on the final approach into an upgraded Piccadilly station   Manchester became the first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992  25 million passenger journeys were made on the system in 2012 13  The present system mostly runs on
