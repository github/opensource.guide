In poker  an isolation play is usually a raise designed to encourage one or more players to fold  specifically for the purpose of making the hand a one on one contest with a specific opponent  For example  if an opponent raises and a player suspects he is holding a weak  but playable hand  they may reraise to pressure other opponents to fold  with the aim of getting heads up with the opening raiser   Isolation plays are most common against overly aggressive players   maniacs   who frequently play inferior hands  or with players who may have a drawing hand  Isolation plays are also common in tournaments to isolate a player who is  short stacked   that is  one who is in imminent danger of elimination  and so is likely to be playing aggressively out of desperation  However  when a player is extremely short stacked compared to the rest of the field in a tournament  making him bust will sometimes be more profitable than winning his chips  so inducing overcalls from other players trumps isolation play   Isolating is encouraged when holding a hand that fares better heads up than in a multi way pot  For instance  when a player has a small pocket pair he may raise a large amount simply to knock out other players because typically a small pocket pair is about 50–60% likely to win an all in pot in a heads up situation  but less likely when facing multiple opponents   1  See also  Protection  poker   Poker jargon  2  References
