A lesbian is a female homosexual  a female who experiences romantic love or sexual attraction to other females  The term lesbian is also used with regard to sexual identity or sexual behavior  regardless of sexual orientation  or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same sex attraction   The concept of  lesbian   to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation  is a 20th century construct  Throughout history  women have not had the same freedom or independence to pursue homosexual relationships as men  but neither have they met the same harsh punishment as homosexual men in some societies  Instead  lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless and incomparable to heterosexual ones unless the participants attempted to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men  As a result  little in history was documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality is expressed  When early sexologists in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior  hampered by a lack of knowledge about homosexuality or women s sexuality  they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female gender roles and incorrectly designated them mentally ill—a designation which has been reversed in the global scientific community   Women in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States  Following World War II  during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals  women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other  Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families  With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women s history and sexuality in the 20th century  the definition of lesbian broadened  sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is  Some women who engage in same sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well  while other women s self identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior  sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one s sexual orientation or sexual behavior  due to various reasons  such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting   Portrayals of lesbians in the media suggest that society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles  and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women  Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity  as homosexuals  they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families  friends  and others as a result of homophobia  As women  they face concerns separate from men  Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination  prejudice  and minority stress  Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open   1  Origin and transformation of the term  The word lesbian is derived from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos  home to the 6th century BCE poet Sappho  From various ancient writings  historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho s charge for their instruction or cultural edification  Little of Sappho s poetry remains  but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about  women s daily lives  their relationships  and rituals  She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls  Before the late 19th century  the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos  including a type of wine   In Algernon Charles Swinburne s 1866 poem Sapphics the term  lesbian  appears twice but capitalized both times after twice mentioning the island of Lesbos  and so could be construed to mean  from the island of Lesbos   In 1875  George Saintsbury  in writing about Baudelaire s poetry refers to his  Lesbian studies  in which he includes his poem about  the passion of Delphine  which is a poem simply about love between two women which does not mention the island of Lesbos  though the other poem alluded to  entitled  Lesbos   does  Lesbianism  to describe erotic relationships between women  had been documented in 1870  In 1890  the term lesbian was used in a medical dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism  as  lesbian love    The terms lesbian  invert and homosexual were interchangeable with sapphist and sapphism around the turn of the 20th century  The use of lesbian in medical literature became prominent  by 1925  the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of a sodomite   The development of medical knowledge was a significant factor in further connotations of the term lesbian  In the middle of the 19th century  medical writers attempted to establish ways to identify male homosexuality  which was considered a significant social problem in most Western societies  In categorizing behavior that indicated what was referred to as  inversion  by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld  researchers categorized what was normal sexual behavior for men and women  and therefore to what extent men and women varied from the  perfect male sexual type  and the  perfect female sexual type    Far less literature focused on female homosexual behavior than on male homosexuality  as medical professionals did not consider it a significant problem  In some cases  it was not acknowledged to exist  However  sexologists Richard von Krafft Ebing from Germany  and Britain s Havelock Ellis wrote some of the earliest and more enduring categorizations of female same sex attraction  approaching it as a form of insanity  Krafft Ebing  who considered lesbianism  what he termed  Uranism   a neurological disease  and Ellis  who was influenced by Krafft Ebing s writings  disagreed about whether sexual inversion was generally a lifelong condition  Ellis believed that many women who professed love for other women changed their feelings about such relationships after they had experienced marriage and a  practical life    However  Ellis conceded that there were  true inverts  who would spend their lives pursuing erotic relationships with women  These were members of the  third sex  who rejected the roles of women to be subservient  feminine  and domestic  Invert described the opposite gender roles  and also the related attraction to women instead of men  since women in the Victorian period were considered unable to initiate sexual encounters  women who did so with other women were thought of as possessing masculine sexual desires   The work of Krafft Ebing and Ellis was widely read  and helped to create public consciousness of female homosexuality  The sexologists  claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well accepted by homosexual men  it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor should be considered a criminal vice  as was widely acknowledged  In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions  homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted  and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin  Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture   Lesbians in Western cultures in particular often classify themselves as having an identity that defines their individual sexuality  as well as their membership to a group that shares common traits  Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women  but they rarely were designated as part of a group of people based on who they had physical relations with  As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures  the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity   2  Female homosexuality without identity in Western culture  2 1  General  The varied meanings of lesbian since the early 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities  Discussion from historians caused further questioning of what qualifies as a lesbian relationship  As lesbian feminists asserted  a sexual component was unnecessary in declaring oneself a lesbian if the primary and closest relationships were with women  When considering past relationships within appropriate historic context  there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions  In 1989  an academic cohort named the Lesbian History Group wrote   Because of society s reluctance to admit that lesbians exist  a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label  Evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here    A woman who never married  who lived with another woman  whose friends were mostly women  or who moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles  may well have been a lesbian      But this sort of evidence is not  proof   What our critics want is incontrovertible evidence of sexual activity between women  This is almost impossible to find  Female sexuality is often not adequately represented in texts and documents  Until very recently  much of what has been documented about women s sexuality has been written by men  in the context of male understanding  and relevant to women s associations to men—as their wives  daughters  or mothers  for example  Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales  giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were   2 2  Ancient Greece and Rome  History is often analyzed with contemporary ideologies  Ancient Greece as a subject enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century  Based on their social priorities  British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized  white  and masculine society  and essentially removed women from historical importance  Women in Greece were sequestered with each other  and men with men  In this homosocial environment erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature  art  and philosophy  Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women  There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls  The poet Alcman used the term aitis  as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship  Aristophanes  in Plato s Symposium  mentions women who love women  but uses the term trepesthai  to be focused on  instead of eros  which was applied to other erotic relationships between men  and between men and women   Historian Nancy Rabinowitz argues that ancient Greek red vase images portraying women with their arms around another woman s waist  or leaning on a woman s shoulders can be construed as expressions of romantic desire  Much of the daily lives of women in ancient Greece is unknown  specifically their expressions of sexuality  Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside of marriage  there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met  Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection  and in instances where women appear only with other women  their images are eroticized  bathing  touching one another  with dildos placed in and around such scenes  and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction  Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown   Women in Ancient Rome were similarly subject to men s definitions of sexuality  Modern scholarship indicates that men viewed female homosexuality with hostility  They considered women who engaged in sexual relations with other women to be biological oddities that would attempt to penetrate women—and sometimes men—with  monstrously enlarged  clitorises  According to scholar James Butrica  lesbianism  challenged not only the Roman male s view of himself as the exclusive giver of sexual pleasure but also the most basic foundations of Rome s male dominated culture   No historical documentation exists of women who had other women as sex partners   2 3  Early Modern Europe  Female homosexuality has not received the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history  Whereas sodomy between men  men and women  and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain  acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts  The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270  In Spain  Italy  and the Holy Roman Empire  sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death  although few instances are recorded of this taking place   The earliest such execution occurred in Speier  Germany  in 1477  Forty days  penance was demanded of nuns who  rode  each other or were discovered to have touched each other s breasts  An Italian nun named Sister Benedetta Carlini was documented to have seduced many of her sisters when possessed by a Divine spirit named  Splenditello   to end her relationships with other women  she was placed in solitary confinement for the last 40 years of her life  Female homoeroticism  however  was so common in English literature and theater that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during the Renaissance   Ideas about women s sexuality were linked to contemporary understanding of female physiology  The vagina was considered an inward version of the penis  where nature s perfection created a man  often nature was thought to be trying to right itself by prolapsing the vagina to form a penis in some women  These sex changes were later thought to be cases of hermaphrodites  and hermaphroditism became synonymous with female same sex desire  Medical consideration of hermaphroditism depended upon measurements of the clitoris  a longer  engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women  Penetration was the focus of concern in all sexual acts  and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a  tribade   literally  one who rubs   Not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate  but pamphlets warning women about masturbation leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales  For a while  masturbation and lesbian sex carried the same meaning   Class distinction  however  became linked as the fashion of female homoeroticism passed  Tribades were simultaneously considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women  and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery  Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals  or more often  their wives  engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations  Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill  Duchess of Marlborough  her closest adviser and confidante  When Churchill was ousted as the queen s favorite  she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen  Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796   2 4  Female husbands  Hermaphroditism appeared in medical literature enough to be considered common knowledge  although cases were rare  Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive  specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced  Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare s Twelfth Night  1601   The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590  and James Shirley s The Bird in a Cage  1633   Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded   If found  punishments ranged from death  to time in the pillory  to being ordered never to dress as a man again  Henry Fielding wrote a pamphlet titled The Female Husband in 1746  based on the life of Mary Hamilton  who married women on three separate occasions  and was sentenced to public whipping in four separate towns and six months in jail  Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717  executed in 1721  Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons  but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison   Queen Christina of Sweden s tendency to dress as a man was well known during her time  and excused because of her noble birth  She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at the time that she was a hermaphrodite  Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage  she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women   Some historians view cases of cross dressing women to be manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire  or their way of making sense out of their desire for women  Lillian Faderman argues that Western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles  Catharine Linck and other women who were accused of using dildos  such as two nuns in 16th century Spain executed for using  material instruments   were punished more severely than those who did not  Two marriages between women were recorded in Cheshire  England  in 1707  between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill  and 1708  between Ane Norton and Alice Pickford  with no comment about both parties being female  Reports of clergymen with lax standards who performed weddings—and wrote their suspicions about one member of the wedding party—continued to appear for the next century   Outside of Europe women were able to dress as men and go undetected  Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff  and pursued relationships with women  Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland  but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria  marrying three times  Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he was found to be Amy Bock  who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux  newspapers argued whether it was a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw   2 5  Re examining romantic friendships  During the 17th through 19th centuries  a woman expressing passionate love for another woman was fashionable  accepted  and encouraged  These relationships were termed romantic friendships  Boston marriages  or  sentimental friends   and were common in the U S   Europe  and especially in England  Documentation of these relationships is possible by a large volume of letters written between women  Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse  but women could form strong and exclusive bonds with each other and still be considered virtuous  innocent  and chaste  a similar relationship with a man would have destroyed a woman s reputation  In fact  these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman s marriage to a man   One such relationship was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu  who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709   Nobody was so entirely  so faithfully yours     I put in your lovers  for I don t allow it possible for a man to be so sincere as I am   Similarly  English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd  who was the subject of many of Seward s sonnets and poems  When Sneyd married despite Seward s protest  Seward s poems became angry  However  Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death  extolling Sneyd s beauty and their affection and friendship  As a young woman  writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood  Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed  Wollstonecraft declared   The roses will bloom when there s peace in the breast  and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart —You know not how I love her   Wollstonecraft s first novel Mary  A Fiction  in part  addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood   Perhaps the most famous of these romantic friendships was between Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby  nicknamed the Ladies of Llangollen  Butler and Ponsonby eloped in 1778  to the relief of Ponsonby s family  concerned about their reputation had she run away with a man  to live together in Wales for 51 years and be thought of as eccentrics  Their story was considered  the epitome of virtuous romantic friendship  and inspired poetry by Anna Seward and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  Diarist Anne Lister  captivated by Butler and Ponsonby  recorded her affairs with women between 1817 and 1840  Some of it was written in code  detailing her sexual relationships with Marianna Belcombe and Maria Barlow  Both Lister and Eleanor Butler were considered masculine by contemporary news reports  and though there were suspicions that these relationships were sapphist in nature  they were nonetheless praised in literature   Romantic friendships were also popular in the U S  Enigmatic poet Emily Dickinson wrote over 300 letters and poems to Susan Gilbert  who later became her sister in law  and engaged in another romantic correspondence with Kate Scott Anthon  Anthon broke off their relationship the same month Dickinson entered self imposed lifelong seclusion  Nearby in Hartford  Connecticut  African American freeborn women Addie Brown and Rebecca Primus left evidence of their passion in letters   No kisses is like youres   In Georgia  Alice Baldy wrote to Josie Varner in 1870   Do you know that if you touch me  or speak to me there is not a nerve of fibre in my body that does not respond with a thrill of delight    Around the turn of the 20th century  the development of higher education provided opportunities for women  In all female surroundings  a culture of romantic pursuit was fostered in women s colleges  Older students mentored younger ones  called on them socially  took them to all women dances  and sent them flowers  cards  and poems that declared their undying love for each other  These were called  smashes  or  spoons   and they were written about quite frankly in stories for girls aspiring to attend college in publications such as Ladies Home Journal  a children s magazine titled St  Nicholas  and a collection called Smith College Stories  without negative views  Enduring loyalty  devotion  and love were major components to these stories  and sexual acts beyond kissing were consistently absent   Women who had the option of a career instead of marriage labeled themselves New Women  and took their new opportunities very seriously  Faderman calls this period  the last breath of innocence  before 1920 when characterizations of female affection were connected to sexuality  marking lesbians as a unique and often unflattering group  Specifically  Faderman connects the growth of women s independence and their beginning to reject strictly prescribed roles in the Victorian era to the scientific designation of lesbianism as a type of aberrant sexual behavior   3  Identity and gender in historical Western culture  3 1  Construction of lesbian identity    File Die Freundin April 30 1930 jpg thumb alt Reproduction of a German magazine cover with the title Die Freundin showing a nude woman sitting on a horse  looking behind her upright Berlin s thriving lesbian community in the 1920s published this magazine between 1924 and 1933     For some women  the realization that they participated in behavior or relationships that could be categorized as lesbian caused them to deny or conceal it  such as professor Jeannette Augustus Marks at Mount Holyoke College  who lived with the college president  Mary Woolley  for 36 years  Marks discouraged young women from  abnormal  friendships and insisted happiness could only be attained with a man  Other women  however  embraced the distinction and used their uniqueness to set themselves apart from heterosexual women and gay men   From the 1890s to the 1930s  American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney held a weekly salon in Paris to which major artistic celebrities were invited and where lesbian topics were the focus  Combining Greek influences with contemporary French eroticism  she attempted to create an updated and idealized version of Lesbos in her salon  Her contemporaries included artist Romaine Brooks  who painted others in her circle  writers Colette  Djuna Barnes  social host Gertrude Stein  and novelist Radclyffe Hall   Berlin had a vibrant homosexual culture in the 1920s  about 50 clubs catering to lesbians existed  women had their own magazine titled Die Freundin  The Girlfriend  between 1924 and 1933  and another titled Garçonne specifically for male transvestites and lesbians  In 1928 a book titled The Lesbians of Berlin written by Ruth Margarite Röllig further popularized the German capital as a center of lesbian activity  Clubs varied between large establishments so popular that they were tourist attractions to small neighborhood cafes where only local women went to find other women   Das Lila Lied    The Lavender Song   served as an anthem to the lesbians of Berlin  Homosexuality was illegal in Germany  though sometimes tolerated  as some functions were allowed by the police who took the opportunity to register the names of homosexuals for future reference  Magnus Hirschfeld s Scientific Humanitarian Committee  which promoted tolerance for homosexuals in Germany  welcomed lesbian participation  and a surge of lesbian themed writing and political activism in the German feminist movement became evident   In 1928  Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled The Well of Loneliness  Its plot centers around Stephen Gordon  a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft Ebing s Psychopathia Sexualis  and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris  The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted  Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft Ebing s theories and rejected Freud s theory that same sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable  The publicity Hall received was due to unintended consequences  the novel was tried for obscenity in London  a spectacularly scandalous event described as  the crystallizing moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian subculture  by professor Laura Doan   Newspaper stories frankly divulged that the book s content includes  sexual relations between Lesbian women   and photographs of Hall often accompanied details about lesbians in most major print outlets within a span of six months  Hall reflected the appearance of a  mannish  woman in the 1920s  short cropped hair  tailored suits  often with pants   and monocle that became widely recognized as a  uniform   When British women participated in World War I  they became familiar with masculine clothing  and were considered patriotic for wearing uniforms and pants  However  postwar masculinization of women s clothing became associated with lesbians   In the United States  the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation  particularly with sex  This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud  who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously  despite an individual s wish to ignore it  Freud s theories were much more pervasive in the U S  than in Europe  With the well publicized notion that sexual acts were a part of lesbianism and their relationships  sexual experimentation was widespread  Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular  and women began to seek out sexual adventure  Bisexuality became chic  particularly in America s first gay neighborhoods   No location saw more visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than Harlem  the predominantly African American section of New York City  White  slummers  enjoyed jazz  nightclubs  and anything else they wished  Blues singers Ma Rainey  Bessie Smith  Ethel Waters  and Gladys Bentley sang about affairs with women to visitors such as Tallulah Bankhead  Beatrice Lillie  and the soon to be named Joan Crawford  Homosexuals began to draw comparisons between their newly recognized minority status and that of African Americans  Among African American residents of Harlem  lesbian relationships were common and tolerated  though not overtly embraced  Some women staged lavish wedding ceremonies  even filing licenses using masculine names with New York City  Most women  however  were married to men and participated in affairs with women regularly  bisexuality was more widely accepted than lesbianism   Across town  Greenwich Village also saw a growing homosexual community  both Harlem and Greenwich Village provided furnished rooms for single men and women  which was a major factor in their development as centers for homosexual communities  The tenor was different in Greenwich Village than Harlem  however  Bohemians—intellectuals who rejected Victorian ideals—gathered in the Village  Homosexuals were predominantly male  although figures such as poet Edna St  Vincent Millay and social host Mabel Dodge were known for their affairs with women and promotion of tolerance of homosexuality  Women in the U S  who could not visit Harlem or live in Greenwich Village for the first time were able to visit saloons in the 1920s without being considered prostitutes  The existence of a public space for women to socialize in bars that were known to cater to lesbians  became the single most important public manifestation of the subculture for many decades   according to historian Lillian Faderman   3 2  The Great Depression  The primary component necessary to encourage lesbians to be public and seek other women was economic independence  which virtually disappeared in the 1930s with the Great Depression  Most women in the U S  found it necessary to marry  to a  front  such as a gay man where both could pursue homosexual relationships with public discretion  or to a man who expected a traditional wife  Independent women in the 1930s were generally seen as holding jobs that men should have   The social attitude made very small and close knit communities in large cities that centered around bars  while simultaneously isolating women in other locales  Speaking of homosexuality in any context was socially forbidden  and women rarely discussed lesbianism even amongst themselves  they referred to openly gay people as  in the Life   Freudian psychoanalytic theory was pervasive in influencing doctors to consider homosexuality as a neurosis afflicting immature women  Homosexual subculture disappeared in Germany with the rise of the Nazis in 1933   3 3  World War II  The onset of World War II caused a massive upheaval in people s lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men  Women were also accepted into the military in the U S  Women s Army Corps  WACs  and U S  Navy s Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service  WAVES   Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals  which had been in place since the creation of the American military  there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians  they were put into place gradually during World War II  Despite common attitudes regarding women s traditional roles in the 1930s  independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the military in the 1940s  and frailty discouraged   Some women were able to arrive at the recruiting station in a man s suit  deny ever having been in love with another woman  and be easily inducted  Sexual activity  however  was forbidden  and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian  As women found each other  they formed into tight groups on base  socialized at service clubs  and began to use code words  Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian  and also never spoke about others  orientation   The most masculine women were not necessarily common  though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians  Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully  sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright  Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men  in order to continue national productivity  The increased mobility  sophistication  and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands  something that would not have been feasible under different economic and social circumstances  further shaping lesbian networks and environments   3 4  Postwar years  Following World War II  a nationwide movement pressed to return to pre war society as quickly as possible in the U S  When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge  homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U S  government in 1950  Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail  and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals  beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees  private lives  State and local governments followed suit  arresting people for congregating in bars and parks  and enacting laws against cross dressing for men and women   The U S  military and government conducted many interrogations  asking if women had ever had sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one time experience to a criminal identity  thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals  In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community  general population  and among many lesbians themselves   Attitudes and practices to ferret out homosexuals in public service positions extended to Australia and Canada  A section to create an offence of  gross indecency  between females was added to a bill in the United Kingdom House of Commons and passed there in 1921  but was rejected in the House Of Lords  apparently because they were concerned any attention paid to sexual misconduct would also promote it   3 4 1  Underground socializing  Very little information was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts  Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police once a month on average  with those arrested exposed in newspapers  In response  eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have a place to dance  When they decided to make it a regular meeting  they became the first organization for lesbians in the U S   titled the Daughters of Bilitis  DOB   The DOB began publishing a magazine titled The Ladder in 1956  inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement  the first of which stated was  Education of the variant   It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality—specifically relating to women  and famous lesbians in history  However  by 1956 the term  lesbian  had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused to use it as a descriptor  choosing  variant  instead   The DOB spread to Chicago  New York  and Los Angeles  and The Ladder was mailed to hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members discussing the nature of homosexuality  sometimes challenging the idea that it was a sickness  with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians  and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society s response to it  British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964  with a similar mission   3 4 2  Butch and femme dichotomy  As a reflection of categories of sexuality so sharply defined by the government and society at large  lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women  particularly among the working class in the U S  and Canada  Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross dressing  some women would socialize in bars as butches  dressed in men s clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior  Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes  Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored  or at least unable to date anyone  and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable   Butch women were not a novelty in the 1950s  even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae  In the 1950s and 1960s  however  the roles were pervasive and not limited to North America  from 1940 to 1970  butch femme bar culture flourished in Britain  though there were fewer class distinctions  They further identified members of a group that had been marginalized  women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in  Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period  Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations  and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates   3 4 3  Lesbian themed fiction  Regardless of the lack of information about homosexuality in scholarly texts  another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing  A paperback book titled Women s Barracks describing a woman s experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950  It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed  After 4 5 million copies were sold  it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952  Its publisher  Gold Medal Books  followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952  which sold 1 5 million copies  Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter  and followed with more books  creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction   Between 1955 and 1969 over 2 000 books were published using lesbianism as a topic  and they were sold in corner drugstores  train stations  bus stops  and newsstands all over the U S  and Canada  Most were written by  and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men  Coded words and images were used on the covers  Instead of  lesbian   terms such as  strange    twilight    queer   and  third sex   were used in the titles  and cover art was invariably salacious  A handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians  including Ann Bannon  Valerie Taylor  Paula Christian  and Vin Packer Ann Aldrich  Bannon  who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction  later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art  Many of the books used cultural references  naming places  terms  describing modes of dress and other codes to isolated women  As a result  pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers   3 5  Second wave feminism  The social rigidity of the 1950s and early 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements to improve the standing of African Americans  the poor  women  and gays all became prominent  Of the latter two  the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots  What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian   The sexual revolution in the 1970s introduced the differentiation between identity and sexual behavior for women  Many women took advantage of their new social freedom to try new experiences  Women who previously identified as heterosexual tried sleeping with women  though many maintained their heterosexual identity  However  with the advent of second wave feminism  lesbian as a political identity grew to describe a social philosophy among women  often overshadowing sexual desire as a defining trait  A militant feminist organization named Radicalesbians published a manifesto in 1970 entitled  The Woman Identified Woman  that declared  A lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explosion    Militant feminists expressed their disdain with an inherently sexist and patriarchal society  and concluded the most effective way to overcome sexism and attain the equality of women would be to deny men any power or pleasure from women  For women who subscribed to this philosophy—dubbing themselves lesbian feminists—lesbian was a term chosen by women to describe any woman who dedicated her approach to social interaction and political motivation to the welfare of women  Sexual desire was not the defining characteristic of a lesbian feminist  but rather her focus on politics  Independence from men as oppressors was a central tenet of lesbian feminism  and many believers strove to separate themselves physically and economically from traditional male centered culture  In the ideal society  named Lesbian Nation   woman  and  lesbian  were interchangeable   In 1980  poet and essayist Adrienne Rich expanded upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing a continuum of lesbian existence based on  woman identified experience   All relationships between women  Rich proposed  have some lesbian element  regardless if they claim a lesbian identity  mothers and daughters  women who work together  and women who nurse each other  for example  Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures  and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men  Several years earlier  DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is  by providing their definition   a woman whose primary erotic  psychological  emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex  even though that interest may not be overtly expressed    Although lesbian feminism was a significant shift  not all lesbians agreed with it  Lesbian feminism was a youth oriented movement  its members were primarily college educated  with experience in New Left and radical causes  but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women s issues  Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate  The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on  feminism or gay rights issues   As equality was a priority for lesbian feminists  disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal  Lesbian feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars  as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men  many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men  or take up their causes  However  lesbians who held a more essentialist view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor  lesbian  to define sexual attraction  often considered the separatist  angry opinions of lesbian feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights   4  Outside of Western culture  4 1  Middle East  Female homosexual behavior may be present in every culture  although the concept of a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not  Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women s roles in each society  and each culture s definition of sex  Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men  In the 7th and 8th centuries  some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict  but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women  The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men  including false facial hair  but they competed with other women for the attentions of men   Highly intelligent women  according to the 12th century writings of Sharif al Idrisi  were more likely to be lesbians  their intellectual prowess put them on a more even par with men  Relations between women who lived in harems  and fears of women being sexually intimate in Turkish baths were expressed in writings by men  Women  however  were mostly silent and men likewise rarely wrote about lesbian relationships  It is unclear to historians if the rare instances of lesbianism mentioned in literature are an accurate historical record or intended to serve as fantasies for men  A 1978 treatise about repression in Iran asserted that women were completely silenced   In the whole of Iranian history   no woman  has been allowed to speak out for such tendencies     To attest to lesbian desires would be an unforgivable crime    Although the authors of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships  a lesbian anthropologist in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman  Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men  those who do not are ostracized  Women  however  may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met  their private matters are kept quiet  and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover   The United Nations estimate for the number of honor killings in the world is 5000 per year  Many women s groups in the Middle East and Southwest Asia suspect that more than 20 000 women are honor killed in the world each year   4 2  The Americas  Indigenous people in North and South America conceptualized a third gender for men women and women men  These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas  Timucuan in Florida  and Cueva in Panama  In Cree  the term for a man who took the role of a woman was ayekkwew  the Zuni word for a woman who took the role of a man was katsotse  boy girl   and the Mohave give women the term hwame  The cross gender roles have less to do with sexuality than with spirituality and occupation  A  two spirit  woman who has a relationship with a non cross gender woman is thought to be a  hetero gender  relationship   In Latin America  lesbian consciousness and associations appeared in the 1970s  increasing while several countries transitioned to or reformed democratic governments  Harassment and intimidation have been common even in places where homosexuality is legal  and laws against child corruption  morality  or  the good ways   faltas a la moral o las buenas costumbres   have been used to persecute homosexuals  From the Hispanic perspective  the conflict between the lesbophobia of feminists and the misogyny from gay men has created a difficult path for lesbians and associated groups   Argentina was the first Latin American country with a gay rights group  Nuestro Mundo  NM  or Our World   created in 1969  Six mostly secret organizations concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time  but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976  when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War  Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women   The Latin American lesbian movement has been the most active in Mexico  but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion  While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns  they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women  In 1977  Lesbos  the first lesbian organization for Mexicans  was formed  Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved  13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997  Ultimately  however  lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements   In Chile  the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet forbade the creation of lesbian groups until 1984  when Ayuquelén   joy of being  in Mapuche  was first founded  prompted by the very public beating death of a woman amid shouts of  Damned lesbian   from her attacker  The lesbian movement has been closely associated with the feminist movement in Chile  although the relationship has been sometimes strained  Ayuquelén worked with the International Lesbian Information Service  the International Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual  Trans and Intersex Association  and the Chilean gay rights group Movimiento de Integración y Liberación Homosexual  Movement to Integrate and Liberate Homosexuals  to remove the sodomy law still in force in Chile   Lesbian consciousness began in Nicaragua in 1986  when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled gay men and lesbians from its midst  State persecution prevented the formation of associations until AIDS became a concern  when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together  The first lesbian organization was Nosotras  founded in 1989  An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994  effectively ending the movement  until 2004  when Grupo Safo – Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created  four years before homosexuality became legal again   The meetings of feminist lesbians of Latin America and the Caribbean  sometimes shortened to  Lesbian meetings   have been an important forum for the exchange of ideas for Latin American lesbians since the late 1980s  With rotating hosts and biannual gatherings  its main aims are the creation of communication networks  to change the situation of lesbians in Latin America  both legally and socially   to increase solidarity between lesbians and to destroy the existing myths about them   4 3  Africa  Cross gender roles and marriage between women has also been recorded in over 30 African societies  Women may marry other women  raise their children  and be generally thought of as men in societies in Nigeria  Cameroon  and Kenya  The Hausa people of Sudan have a term equivalent to lesbian  kifi  that may also be applied to males to mean  neither party insists on a particular sexual role    Near the Congo River a female who participates in strong emotional or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people is known as yaikya bonsángo  a woman who presses against another woman   Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people  In Lesotho  females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world  they kiss  sleep together  rub genitals  participate in cunnilingus  and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly  Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis  however  they do not consider their behavior sexual  nor label themselves lesbians   In South Africa  lesbians are raped by heterosexual men with a goal of punishment of  abnormal  behavior and reinforcement of societal norms  The crime was first identified in South Africa where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman s family or local community  and is a major contributor to HIV infection in South African lesbians  Corrective rape is not recognized by the South African legal system as a hate crime despite the fact that the South African Constitution states that no person shall be discriminated against based on their social status and identity  including sexual orientation  Legally  South Africa protects gay rights extensively  but the government does not do anything to prevent corrective rape  and women do not have much faith in the police and their investigations   Corrective rape is on the rise in South Africa  More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang raped weekly  as estimated by Luleki Sizwe  a South African nonprofit  It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted  as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008  Yet  victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality   4 4  Asia  China before westernization was another society that segregated men from women  Historical Chinese culture has not recognized a concept of sexual orientation  or a framework to divide people based on their same sex or opposite sex attractions  Although there was a significant culture surrounding homosexual men  there was none for women  Outside of their duties to bear sons to their husbands  women were perceived as having no sexuality at all   This did not mean that women could not pursue sexual relationships with other women  but that such associations could not impose upon women s relationships to men  Rare references to lesbianism were written by Ying Shao  who identified same sex relationships between women in imperial courts who behaved as husband and wife as dui shi  paired eating    Golden Orchid Associations  in Southern China existed into the 20th century and promoted formal marriages between women  who were then allowed to adopt children  Westernization brought new ideas that all sexual behavior not resulting in reproduction was aberrant   The liberty of being employed in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu shu nii  never to marry  and live in communes with other women  Other Chinese called them sou hei  self combers  for adopting hairstyles of married women  These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China  In contemporary Chinese society  tongzhi  same goal or spirit  is the term used to refer to homosexuals  most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians   In Japan  the term rezubian  a Japanese pronunciation of  lesbian   was used during the 1920s  Westernization brought more independence for women and allowed some Japanese women to wear pants  The cognate tomboy is used in the Philippines  and particularly in Manila  to denote women who are more masculine  Virtuous women in Korea prioritize motherhood  chastity  and virginity  outside of this scope  very few women are free to express themselves through sexuality  although there is a growing organization for lesbians named Kkirikkiri  The term pondan is used in Malaysia to refer to gay men  but since there is no historical context to reference lesbians  the term is used for female homosexuals as well  As in many Asian countries  open homosexuality is discouraged in many social levels  so many Malaysians lead double lives   In India  a 14th century Indian text mentioning a lesbian couple who had a child as a result of their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality  This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996  prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists  Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence  but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men  Women s rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms  as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed   5  Demographics  5 1  The Kinsey Report  The most extensive early study of female homosexuality was provided by the Institute for Sex Research  who published an in depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953  More than 8 000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female  popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report  The Kinsey Report s dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary  Up to this study  only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior  and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view   Kinsey and his staff reported that 28% of women had been aroused by another female  and 19% had a sexual contact with another female  Of women who had sexual contact with another female  half to two thirds of them had orgasmed  Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity  followed by women who were widowed  divorced  or separated  The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women  those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity   Most of the women who reported homosexual activity had not experienced it more than ten times  Fifty one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner  Women with post graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience  followed by women with a college education  the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade  However  Kinsey s methodology was criticized   Based on Kinsey s scale where 0 represents a person with an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 represents a person with an exclusively homosexual one  and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes  6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6  exclusively homosexual  Apart from those who ranked 0  71%   the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%  However  the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person s life  and that a person s orientation may change  Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received  a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research s tendency to use statistical sampling  which facilitated an over representation of same sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey s qualifications of data   5 2  The Hite Report  Twenty three years later  in 1976  sexologist Shere Hite published a report on the sexual encounters of 3 019 women who had responded to questionnaires  under the title The Hite Report  Hite s questions differed from Kinsey s  focusing more on how women identified  or what they preferred rather than experience  Respondents to Hite s questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women  though they refused to indicate preference   Hite s conclusions are more based on respondents  comments than quantifiable data  She found it  striking  that many women who had no lesbian experiences indicated they were interested in sex with women  particularly because the question was not asked  Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents  experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation  and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses  Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s  she also acknowledged that women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian   5 3  Population estimates  Lesbians in the U S  are estimated to be about 2 6% of the population  according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same sex experiences within the past year  completed in 2000  A survey of same sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005  the number of people claiming to be in same sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U S  The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self identifying as homosexual to the federal government   The government of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define their sexuality  However  a survey by the UK Office for National Statistics  ONS  in 2010 found that 1 5% of Britons identified themselves as gay or bisexual  and the ONS suggests that this is in line with other surveys showing the number between 0 3% and 3%  Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same sex households  such as those performed by the U S  census  and estimates of total gay  lesbian  or bisexual population by the U K  government  However  polls in Australia have recorded a range of self identified lesbian or bisexual women from 1 3% to 2 2% of the total population   6  Health  6 1  Physical  In terms of medical issues  lesbians are referred to as women who have sex with women  WSW  because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women s sexuality and some women s hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician  Many self identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control  which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active  As a result  many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears  The U S  government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U S   they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners   The result of the lack of medical information on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease or types of cancer  When women do seek medical attention  medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history  In a recent study of 2 345 lesbian and bisexual women  only 9 3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician  A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction  and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual  A patient s complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women  In a similar survey of 6 935 lesbians  77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners  and 6% had that contact within the previous year   Heart disease is listed by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services as the number one cause of death for all women  Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking  both of which are more prevalent in lesbians  Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women  and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do  Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women  and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons  although heterosexual women do  Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians   Lack of differentiation between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non lesbian women  Reports are inconclusive about occurrence of breast cancer in lesbians  It has been determined  however  that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears makes it more difficult to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians  The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women  perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy  abortion  contraceptives  breast feeding  and miscarriages   Some sexually transmitted diseases are communicable between women  including human papillomavirus  HPV —specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions  trichomoniasis  syphilis  and herpes simplex virus  HSV   Transmission of specific sexually transmitted diseases among women who have sex with women depends on the sexual practices women engage in  Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions  vaginal mucosa  or menstrual blood  including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit sexually transmitted diseases  Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV  even among women who have had no prior sex with men   Bacterial vaginosis  BV  occurs more often in lesbians  but it is unclear if BV is transmitted by sexual contact  it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women  BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship  a recent study of women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV  Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  transmission  although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions  The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men   6 2  Mental  Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality  it has often been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause  influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud  Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people  and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation  exclusive same sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts  Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression  substance abuse  and suicide  Although these issues exist among lesbians  discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973  Instead  social ostracism  legal discrimination  internalization of negative stereotypes  and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health   Women who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence  These emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual  On the whole  women tend to work through developing a self concept internally  or with other women with whom they are intimate  Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to  and more often see being lesbian as a choice  as opposed to gay men  who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control   Anxiety disorders and depression are the most common mental health issues for women  Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women  although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women  Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family  or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination  or endure relationship difficulties with no support system  Men s shaping of women s sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies  Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women  Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self esteem  eating disorders  and higher incidence of depression  More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts  and 18% had attempted suicide   A population based study completed by the National Alcohol Research Center found that women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol  Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol  as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs  Many lesbian communities are centered in bars  and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women   7  Media representation  7 1  Summary  Lesbians portrayed in literature  film  and television often shape contemporary thought about women s sexuality  The majority of media about lesbians is produced by men  women s publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s  films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s  and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century  As a result  homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation  When depictions of lesbians began to surface  they were often one dimensional  simplified stereotypes   7 2  Literature  In addition to Sappho s accomplishments  literary historian Jeannette Howard Foster includes the Book of Ruth  and ancient mythological tradition as examples of lesbianism in classical literature  Greek stories of the heavens often included a female figure whose virtue and virginity were unspoiled  who pursued more masculine interests  and who was followed by a dedicated group of maidens  Foster cites Camilla and Diana  Artemis and Callisto  and Iphis and Ianthe as examples of female mythological figures who showed remarkable devotion to each other  or defied gender expectations  The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named Amazons  En hedu ana  a priestess in Ancient Iraq who dedicated herself to the Sumerian goddess Inanna  has the distinction of signing the oldest surviving signed poetry in history  She characterized herself as Inanna s spouse   For ten centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire  lesbianism disappeared from literature  Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind  original sin among women was a particular concern  especially because women were perceived as creating life  During this time  women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit  so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality   In 15–16th century French and English depictions of relationships between women  Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665  John Cleland s 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure  L Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778   writers  attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal  whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act  Physical relationships between women were often encouraged  men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available  and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women  At worst  if a woman became enamored of another woman  she became a tragic figure  Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus  Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges   Lesbianism became almost exclusive to French literature in the 19th century  based on male fantasy and the desire to shock bourgeois moral values  Honoré de Balzac  in The Girl with the Golden Eyes  1835   employed lesbianism in his story about three people living amongst the moral degeneration of Paris  and again in Cousin Bette and Séraphîta  His work influenced novelist Théophile Gautier s Mademoiselle de Maupin  which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians  tall  wide shouldered  slim hipped  and athletically inclined  Charles Baudelaire repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems  Lesbos    Femmes damnées 1    Damned Women    and  Femmes damnées 2    Reflecting French society  as well as employing stock character associations  many of the lesbian characters in 19th century French literature were prostitutes or courtesans  personifications of vice who died early  violent deaths in moral endings  Samuel Taylor Coleridge s 1816 poem  Christabel  and the novella Carmilla  1872  by Sheridan Le Fanu both present lesbianism associated with vampirism  Portrayals of female homosexuality not only formed European consciousness about lesbianism  but Krafft Ebing cited the characters in Gustave Flaubert s Salammbô  1862  and Ernest Feydeau s Le Comte de Chalis  1867  as examples of lesbians because both novels feature female protagonists who do not adhere to social norms and express  contrary sexual feeling   although neither participated in same sex desire or sexual behavior  Havelock Ellis used literary examples from Balzac and several French poets and writers to develop his framework to identify sexual inversion in women   Gradually  women began to author their own thoughts and literary works about lesbian relationships  Until the publication of The Well of Loneliness  most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men  Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same sex love as a topic  and that some writers including Louise Labé  Charlotte Charke  and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male  or made them ambiguous  Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century  writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand s appearance in Paris society in the 1830s  Charlotte Brontë s Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes   In the 20th century  Katherine Mansfield  Amy Lowell  Gertrude Stein  H D   Vita Sackville West  Virginia Woolf  and Gale Wilhelm wrote popular works that had same sex relationships or gender transformations as themes  Some women  such as Marguerite Yourcenar and Mary Renault  wrote or translated works of fiction that focused on homosexual men  like some of the writings of Carson McCullers  All three were involved in same sex relationships  but their primary friendships were with gay men  Foster further asserts 1928 was a  peak year  for lesbian themed literature  in addition to The Well of Loneliness  three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England  Elizabeth Bowen s The Hotel  Woolf s Orlando  and Compton Mackenzie s satirical novel Extraordinary Women  Unlike The Well of Loneliness  none of these novels were banned   As the paperback book came into fashion  lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction  Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women  or relationships that ended tragically  Marijane Meaker later wrote that she was told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers were concerned about the books being confiscated by the U S  Postal Service  Patricia Highsmith  writing as Claire Morgan  wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive  but instead used a pseudonym   Following the Stonewall riots  lesbian themes in literature became much more diverse and complex  and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians  Feminist magazines such as The Furies  and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder  Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown s Rubyfruit Jungle  1973   which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian  Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works  and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature  Further changing values are evident in the writings of Dorothy Allison  who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes   7 3  Film  Lesbianism  or the suggestion of it  began early in filmmaking  The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films  Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones  Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey  In Morocco  1930  Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips  and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett  1936   Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality   Overt female homosexuality was introduced in 1929 s Pandora s Box between Louise Brooks and Alice Roberts  However  the development of the Hays Code in 1930 censored most references to homosexuality from film under the umbrella term  sex perversion   German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe  but 1931 s Mädchen in Uniform was not distributed in the U S  because of the depiction of an adolescent s love for a female teacher in boarding school   Because of the Hays Code  lesbianism after 1930 was absent from most films  even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices  Lillian Hellman s play The Children s Hour was converted into a heterosexual love triangle and retitled These Three  Biopic Queen Christina in 1933  starring Greta Garbo  veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden s affairs with women  Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced  The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954 s The Pit of Loneliness was that it was   Immoral  would tend to corrupt morals   The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961  and the next year William Wyler remade The Children s Hour with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine  After MacLaine s character admits her love for Hepburn s  she hangs herself  this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality   Gay characters also were often killed off at the end  such as the death of Sandy Dennis  character at the end of The Fox in 1968  If not victims  lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt  such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963  Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca  1940   women s prison films like Caged  1950   or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia  With Love  1963   Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula s Daughter  1936   Blood and Roses  1960   Vampyros Lesbos  1971   and The Hunger  1983   Basic Instinct  1992  featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone  it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators   The first film to address lesbianism with significant depth was The Killing of Sister George in 1968  which was filmed in The Gateways Club  a longstanding lesbian pub in London  It is the first to claim a film character who identifies as a lesbian  and film historian Vito Russo considers the film a complex treatment of a multifaceted character who is forced into silence about her openness by other lesbians  Personal Best in 1982  and Lianna in 1983 treat the lesbian relationships more sympathetically and show lesbian sex scenes  though in neither film are the relationships happy ones  Personal Best was criticized for engaging in the cliched plot device of one woman returning to a relationship with a man  implying that lesbianism is a phase  as well as treating the lesbian relationship with  undisguised voyeurism   More ambiguous portrayals of lesbian characters were seen in Silkwood  1983   The Color Purple  1985   and Fried Green Tomatoes  1991   despite explicit lesbianism in the source material   An era of independent filmmaking brought different stories  writers  and directors to films  Desert Hearts arrived in 1985  to be one of the most successful  Directed by lesbian Donna Deitch  it is loosely based on Jane Rule s novel Desert of the Heart  It received mixed critical commentary  but earned positive reviews from the gay press  The late 1980s and early 1990s ushered in a series of films treating gay and lesbian issues seriously  made by gays and lesbians  nicknamed New Queer Cinema  Films using lesbians as a subject included Rose Troche s avant garde romantic comedy Go Fish  1994  and the first film about African American lesbians  Cheryl Dunye s The Watermelon Woman  in 1995   Realism in films depicting lesbians developed further to include romance stories such as The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love and When Night Is Falling  both in 1995  Better Than Chocolate  1999   and the social satire But I m A Cheerleader in 2001  A twist on the lesbian as predator theme was the added complexity of motivations of some lesbian characters in Peter Jackson s Heavenly Creatures  1994   the Oscar winning biopic of Aileen Wuornos  Monster  2003   and the exploration of fluent sexuality and gender in Chasing Amy  1997   Kissing Jessica Stein  2001   and Boys Don t Cry  1999   The film V for Vendetta shows a dictatorship in future Britain that forces lesbians  homosexuals  and other  unwanted  people in society to be systematically slaughtered in Nazi concentration camps  In the film  a lesbian actress named Valerie  who was killed in such a manner  serves as inspiration for the masked rebel V and his ally Evey Hammond  who set out to overthrow the dictatorship   7 4  Television  Homosexuality addressed by television started much later than films  Local talk shows in the late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts  usually not gay themselves  to discuss the problems of gay men in society  Lesbianism was rarely included  The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s  in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director  and in distress  calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep rooted guilt about her feelings for women  When she realizes this  however  she is able to pursue healthy heterosexual relationships   Invisibility for lesbians continued in the 1970s when homosexuality became the subject of dramatic portrayals  first with medical dramas  The Bold Ones  Marcus Welby  M D   Medical Center  featuring primarily male patients coming out to doctors  or staff members coming out to other staff members  These shows allowed homosexuality to be discussed clinically  with the main characters guiding troubled gay characters or correcting homophobic antagonists  while simultaneously comparing homosexuality to psychosis  criminal behavior  or drug use   Another stock plot device in the 1970s was the gay character in a police drama  They served as victims of blackmail or anti gay violence  but more often as criminals  Beginning in the late 1960s with N Y P D   Police Story  and Police Woman  the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent  according to Vito Russo  as a response to their higher profiles in gay activism  Lesbians were included as villains  motivated to murder by their desires  internalized homophobia  or fear of being exposed as homosexual  One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money  NBC edited the episode because of the protests  but a sit in was staged in the head of NBC s offices   In the middle of the 1970s  gays and lesbians began to appear as police officers or detectives  facing coming out issues  This did not extend to CBS  groundbreaking show Cagney & Lacey in 1982  starring two female police detectives  CBS production made conscious attempts to soften the characters so they would not appear to be lesbians  In 1991  a bisexual lawyer portrayed by Amanda Donohoe on L A  Law shared the first significant lesbian kiss on primetime television with Michele Greene  stirring a controversy despite being labeled  chaste  by The Hollywood Reporter   Though television did not begin to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s  some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls  gay straight   supporting characters who were quirky  did not comply with gender norms  or had ambiguous personal lives  that  for all purposes should be gay   These included Zelda from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis  Miss Hathaway from The Beverly Hillbillies  and Jo from The Facts of Life  In the mid 1980s through the 1990s  sitcoms frequently employed a  coming out  episode  where a friend of one of the stars admits she is a lesbian  forcing the cast to deal with the issue  Designing Women  The Golden Girls  and Friends used this device with women in particular   Recurring lesbian characters who came out were seen on Married With Children  Mad About You  and Roseanne  in which a highly publicized episode had ABC executives afraid a televised kiss between Roseanne and Mariel Hemingway would destroy ratings and ruin advertising  The episode was instead the week s highest rated  By far the sitcom with the most significant impact to the image of lesbians was Ellen  Publicity surrounding Ellen s coming out episode in 1997 was enormous  Ellen DeGeneres appeared on the cover of Time magazine the week before the airing of  The Puppy Episode  with the headline  Yep  I m Gay   Parties were held in many U S  cities to watch the episode  and the opposition from conservative organizations was intense  WBMA LP  the ABC affiliate in Birmingham  Alabama  even refused to air the first run of the episode  citing conservative values of the local viewing audience  which earned the station some infamy and ire in the LGBT community  Even still   The Puppy Episode  won an Emmy for writing  but as the show began to deal with Ellen Morgan s sexuality each week  network executives grew uncomfortable with the direction the show took and canceled it   Dramas following L A  Law began incorporating homosexual themes  particularly with continuing storylines on Relativity  Picket Fences  ER  and Star Trek  The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine  both of which tested the boundaries of sexuality and gender  A show directed at adolescents that had a particularly strong cult following was Buffy the Vampire Slayer  In the fourth season of Buffy  Tara and Willow admit their love for each other without any special fanfare and the relationship is treated as are the other romantic relationships on the show   What followed was a series devoted solely to gay characters from network television  Showtime s American rendition of Queer as Folk ran for five years  from 2000 to 2005  two of the main characters were a lesbian couple  Showtime promoted the series as  No Limits   and Queer as Folk addressed homosexuality graphically  The aggressive advertising paid off as the show became the network s highest rated  doubling the numbers of other Showtime programs after the first season  In 2004  Showtime introduced The L Word  a dramatic series devoted to a group of lesbian and bisexual women  running its final season in 2009   8  Current issues of lesbians  8 1  Lesbian chic and popular culture  The invisibility of lesbians has gradually eroded since the early 1980s  This is in part due to public figures who have caused speculation and comment in the press about their sexuality and lesbianism in general  The primary figure earning this attention was Martina Navratilova  who served as tabloid fodder for years as she denied being lesbian  admitted to being bisexual  had very public relationships with Rita Mae Brown and Judy Nelson  and acquired as much press about her sexuality as she did her athletic achievements  Navratilova spurred what scholar Diane Hamer termed  constant preoccupation  in the press with determining the root of same sex desire   Other public figures acknowledged their homosexuality and bisexuality  notably musicians k d  lang and Melissa Etheridge  and Madonna s pushing of sexual boundaries in her performances and publications  In 1993  lang and self professed heterosexual supermodel Cindy Crawford posed for the cover of Vanity Fair in a provocative arrangement that showed Crawford shaving lang s face  as lang lounged in a barber s chair wearing a pinstripe suit  The image  became an internationally recognized symbol of the phenomenon of lesbian chic   according to Hamer  The year 1994 marked a rise in lesbian visibility  particularly appealing to women with feminine appearances  Between 1992 and 1994  Mademoiselle  Vogue  Cosmopolitan  Glamour  Newsweek  and New York magazines featured stories about women who admitted sexual histories with other women   One analyst reasoned the recurrence of lesbian chic was due to the often used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s  joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s  unattractive and militant  In short  lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions  All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men  the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men   A resurgence of lesbian visibility and sexual fluidity was noted in 2009 with celebrities such as Cynthia Nixon and Lindsay Lohan commenting openly on their relationships with women  and reality television addressing same sex relationships  Psychiatrists and feminist philosophers write that the rise in women acknowledging same sex relationships is due to growing social acceptance  but also concede that  only a certain kind of lesbian—slim and elegant or butch in just the right androgynous way—is acceptable to mainstream culture    8 2  Sexuality and lesbian identity  The presence of sexual activity between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated  According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick  women s sexuality is constructed by men  whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women  The same indicator is not necessary to identify a woman as heterosexual  however  McCormick states that emotional  mental  and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital  Nonetheless  in the 1980s  a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists  causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars  Butch and femme roles returned  although not as strictly followed as they were in the 1950s  They became a mode of chosen sexual self expression for some women in the 1990s  Once again  women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous  and sexual flexibility became more accepted   The focus of this debate often centers on a phenomenon named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983  Schwartz found that long term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples  calling this lesbian bed death  However  lesbians dispute the study s definition of sexual contact  and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant  greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely  Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women  or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves   More discussion on gender and sexual orientation identity has affected how many women label or view themselves  Most people in western culture are taught that heterosexuality is an innate quality in all people  When a woman realizes her romantic and sexual attraction to another woman  it may cause an  existential crisis   many who go through this adopt the identity of a lesbian  challenging what society has offered in stereotypes about homosexuals  to learn how to function within a homosexual subculture  Lesbians in Western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity  they have a shared history and subculture  and similar experiences with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles  This identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women  and often creates tension with bisexual women   Researchers  including social scientists  state that often behavior and identity do not match  women may label themselves heterosexual but have sexual relations with women  self identified lesbians may have sex with men  or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time  A 2001 article on differentiating lesbians for medical studies and health research suggested identifying lesbians using the three characteristics of identity only  sexual behavior only  or both combined  The article declined to include desire or attraction as it rarely has bearing on measurable health or psychosocial issues  Researchers state that there is no standard definition of lesbian because   t he term has been used to describe women who have sex with women  either exclusively or in addition to sex with men  i e   behavior   women who self identify as lesbian  i e   identity   and women whose sexual preference is for women  i e   desire or attraction   and that   t he lack of a standard definition of lesbian and of standard questions to assess who is lesbian has made it difficult to clearly define a population of lesbian women   How and where study samples were obtained can also affect the definition   8 3  Families and politics  Although homosexuality among females has taken place in many cultures in history  a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same sex partners  Before the 1970s  the idea that same sex adults formed long term committed relationships was unknown to many people  The majority of lesbians  between 60% and 80%  report being in a long term relationship  Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization  the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union  Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles  lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members  Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones   Family issues were significant concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s  Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual  even though the general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother  Several studies performed as a result of custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians  They found that children s mental health  happiness  and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians  Sexual orientation  gender identity  and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected  Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner  fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers  and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means   Improving opportunities for growing families of same sex couples has shaped the political landscape within the past ten years  A push for same sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives    ten countries and six U S  states offer same sex marriage  civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries  U S  states and individual municipalities  The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians  as is improving access to artificial insemination   9  See also
