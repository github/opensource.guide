In computer science  a memory leak occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released  In object oriented programming  a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code  A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems  see below  and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program   Because they can exhaust available system memory as an application runs  memory leaks are often the cause of or a contributing factor to software aging   1  Consequences  A memory leak can diminish the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory  Eventually  in the worst case  too much of the available memory may become allocated and all or part of the system or device stops working correctly  the application fails  or the system slows down unacceptably due to thrashing   Memory leaks may not be serious or even detectable by normal means  In modern operating systems  normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates  This means that a memory leak in a program that only runs for a short time may not be noticed and is rarely serious   Much more serious leaks include those   where the program runs for an extended time and consumes additional memory over time  such as background tasks on servers  but especially in embedded devices which may be left running for many years  where new memory is allocated frequently for one time tasks  such as when rendering the frames of a computer game or animated video  where the program can request memory — such as shared memory — that is not released  even when the program terminates  where memory is very limited  such as in an embedded system or portable device  where the leak occurs within the operating system or memory manager  when a system device driver causes the leak  running on an operating system that does not automatically release memory on program termination  Often on such machines if memory is lost  it can only be reclaimed by a reboot  an example of such a system being AmigaOS   1 1  An example of memory leak  The following example  written in pseudocode  is intended to show how a memory leak can come about  and its effects  without needing any programming knowledge  The program in this case is part of some very simple software designed to control an elevator  This part of the program is run whenever anyone inside the elevator presses the button for a floor   The memory leak would occur if the floor number requested is the same floor that the lift is on  the condition for releasing the memory would be skipped  Each time this case occurs  more memory is leaked   Cases like this wouldn t usually have any immediate effects  People do not often press the button for the floor they are already on  and in any case  the lift might have enough spare memory that this could happen hundreds or thousands of times  However  the lift will eventually run out of memory  This could take months or years  so it might not be discovered despite thorough testing   The consequences would be unpleasant  at the very least  the lift would stop responding to requests to move to another floor  If other parts of the program need memory  a part assigned to open and close the door  for example   then someone may be trapped inside  since the software cannot open the door   The memory leak lasts until the system is reset  For example  if the lift s power were turned off  the program would stop running  When power was turned on again  the program would restart and all the memory would be available again  but the slow process of memory leak would restart together with the program  eventually prejudicing the correct running of the system   2  Programming issues  Memory leaks are a common error in programming  especially when using languages that have no built in automatic garbage collection  such as C and C++  Typically  a memory leak occurs because dynamically allocated memory has become unreachable  The prevalence of memory leak bugs has led to the development of a number of debugging tools to detect unreachable memory  IBM Rational Purify  BoundsChecker  Valgrind  Parasoft Insure++  Dr  Memory and memwatch are some of the more popular memory debuggers for C and C++ programs   Conservative  garbage collection capabilities can be added to any programming language that lacks it as a built in feature  and libraries for doing this are available for C and C++ programs  A conservative collector finds and reclaims most  but not all  unreachable memory   Although the memory manager can recover unreachable memory  it cannot free memory that is still reachable and therefore potentially still useful  Modern memory managers therefore provide techniques for programmers to semantically mark memory with varying levels of usefulness  which correspond to varying levels of reachability  The memory manager does not free an object that is strongly reachable  An object is strongly reachable if it is reachable either directly by a strong reference or indirectly by a chain of strong references   A strong reference is a reference that  unlike a weak reference  prevents an object from being garbage collected   To prevent this  the developer is responsible for cleaning up references after use  typically by setting the reference to null once it is no longer needed and  if necessary  by deregistering any event listeners that maintain strong references to the object   In general  automatic memory management is more robust and convenient for developers  as they don t need to implement freeing routines or worry about the sequence in which cleanup is performed or be concerned about whether or not an object is still referenced  It is easier for a programmer to know when a reference is no longer needed than to know when an object is no longer referenced  However  automatic memory management can impose a performance overhead  and it does not eliminate all of the programming errors that cause memory leaks   3  RAII  RAII  short for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization  is an approach to the problem commonly taken in C++  D  and Ada  It involves associating scoped objects with the acquired resources  and automatically releasing the resources once the objects are out of scope  Unlike garbage collection  RAII has the advantage of knowing when objects exist and when they do not  Compare the following C and C++ examples    * C version *   include void f int n           C++ version  include void f int n        The C version  as implemented in the example  requires explicit deallocation  the array is dynamically allocated  from the heap in most C implementations   and continues to exist until explicitly freed   The C++ version requires no explicit deallocation  it will always occur automatically as soon as the object array goes out of scope  including if an exception is thrown  This avoids some of the overhead of garbage collection schemes  And because object destructors can free resources other than memory  RAII helps to prevent the leaking of input and output resources accessed through a handle  which mark and sweep garbage collection does not handle gracefully  These include open files  open windows  user notifications  objects in a graphics drawing library  thread synchronisation primitives such as critical sections  network connections  and connections to the Windows Registry or another database   However  using RAII correctly is not always easy and has its own pitfalls  For instance  if one is not careful  it is possible to create dangling pointers  or references  by returning data by reference  only to have that data be deleted when its containing object goes out of scope   D uses a combination of RAII and garbage collection  employing automatic destruction when it is clear that an object cannot be accessed outside its original scope  and garbage collection otherwise   4  Reference counting and cyclic references  More modern garbage collection schemes are often based on a notion of reachability – if you don t have a usable reference to the memory in question  it can be collected  Other garbage collection schemes can be based on reference counting  where an object is responsible for keeping track of how many references are pointing to it  If the number goes down to zero  the object is expected to release itself and allow its memory to be reclaimed  The flaw with this model is that it doesn t cope with cyclic references  and this is why nowadays most programmers are prepared to accept the burden of the more costly mark and sweep type of systems   The following Visual Basic code illustrates the canonical reference counting memory leak   Dim A  B Set A   CreateObject  Some Thing   Set B   CreateObject  Some Thing     At this point  the two objects each have one reference   Set A member   B Set B member   A   Now they each have two references   Set A   Nothing   You could still get out of it     Set B   Nothing   And now you ve got a memory leak   End  In practice  this trivial example would be spotted straight away and fixed  In most real examples  the cycle of references spans more than two objects  and is more difficult to detect   A well known example of this kind of leak came to prominence with the rise of AJAX programming techniques in web browsers in the lapsed listener problem  JavaScript code which associated a DOM element with an event handler  and failed to remove the reference before exiting  would leak memory  AJAX web pages keep a given DOM alive for a lot longer than traditional web pages  so this leak was much more apparent    5  Effects  If a program has a memory leak and its memory usage is steadily increasing  there will not usually be an immediate symptom  Every physical system has a finite amount of memory  and if the memory leak is not contained  for example  by restarting the leaking program  it will sooner or later start to cause problems   Most modern consumer desktop operating systems have both main memory which is physically housed in RAM microchips  and secondary storage such as a hard drive  Memory allocation is dynamic – each process gets as much memory as it requests  Active pages are transferred into main memory for fast access  inactive pages are pushed out to secondary storage to make room  as needed  When a single process starts consuming a large amount of memory  it usually occupies more and more of main memory  pushing other programs out to secondary storage – usually significantly slowing performance of the system  Even if the leaking program is terminated  it may take some time for other programs to swap back into main memory  and for performance to return to normal   When all the memory on a system is exhausted  whether there is virtual memory or only main memory  such as on an embedded system  any attempt to allocate more memory will fail  This usually causes the program attempting to allocate the memory to terminate itself  or to generate a segmentation fault  Some programs are designed to recover from this situation  possibly by falling back on pre reserved memory   The first program to experience the out of memory may or may not be the program that has the memory leak   Some multi tasking operating systems have special mechanisms to deal with an out of memory condition  such as killing processes at random  which may affect  innocent  processes   or killing the largest process in memory  which presumably is the one causing the problem   Some operating systems have a per process memory limit  to prevent any one program from hogging all of the memory on the system  The disadvantage to this arrangement is that the operating system sometimes must be re configured to allow proper operation of programs that legitimately require large amounts of memory  such as those dealing with graphics  video  or scientific calculations   If the memory leak is in the kernel  the operating system itself will likely fail  Computers without sophisticated memory management  such as embedded systems  may also completely fail from a persistent memory leak   Publicly accessible systems such as web servers or routers are prone to denial of service attacks if an attacker discovers a sequence of operations which can trigger a leak  Such a sequence is known as an exploit   A  sawtooth  pattern of memory utilization may be an indicator of a memory leak if the vertical drops coincide with reboots or application restarts  Care should be taken though because garbage collection points could also cause such a pattern and would show a healthy usage of the heap   6  Other memory consumers  Note that constantly increasing memory usage is not necessarily evidence of a memory leak  Some applications will store ever increasing amounts of information in memory  e g  as a cache   If the cache can grow so large as to cause problems  this may be a programming or design error  but is not a memory leak as the information remains nominally in use  In other cases  programs may require an unreasonably large amount of memory because the programmer has assumed memory is always sufficient for a particular task  for example  a graphics file processor might start by reading the entire contents of an image file and storing it all into memory  something that is not viable where a very large image exceeds available memory   To put it another way  a memory leak arises from a particular kind of programming error  and without access to the program code  someone seeing symptoms can only guess that there might be a memory leak  It would be better to use terms such as  constantly increasing memory use  where no such inside knowledge exists   7  A simple example in C  The following C function deliberately leaks memory by losing the pointer to the allocated memory  The leak can be said to occur as soon as the pointer  a  goes out of scope  i e  when function which allocates   returns without freeing  a    include void function which allocates void        int main void        8  See also  Buffer overflow  Memory management  Memory debugger  Plumbr is a popular memory leak detection
