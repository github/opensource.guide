A numeral system  or system of numeration  is a writing system for expressing numbers  that is  a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set  using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner  It can be seen as the context that allows the symbols  11  to be interpreted as the binary symbol for three  the decimal symbol for eleven  or a symbol for other numbers in different bases   Ideally  a numeral system will   Represent a useful set of numbers  e g  all integers  or rational numbers   Give every number represented a unique representation  or at least a standard representation   Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers  For example  the usual decimal representation of whole numbers gives every non zero whole number a unique representation as a finite sequence of digits  beginning by a non zero digit  However  when decimal representation is used for the rational or real numbers  such numbers in general have an infinite number of representations  for example 2 31 can also be written as 2 310  2 3100000  2 309999999     etc   all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown   Numeral systems are sometimes called number systems  but that name is ambiguous  as it could refer to different systems of numbers  such as the system of real numbers  the system of complex numbers  the system of p adic numbers  etc  Such systems are not the topic of this article   1  Main numeral systems  The most commonly used system of numerals is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system  Two Indian mathematicians are credited with developing it  Aryabhata of Kusumapura developed the place value notation in the 5th century and a century later Brahmagupta introduced the symbol for zero  The numeral system and the zero concept  developed by the Hindus in India  slowly spread to other surrounding countries due to their commercial and military activities with India  The Arabs adopted and modified it  Even today  the Arabs call the numerals they use  Rakam Al Hind  or the Hindu numeral system  The Arabs translated Hindu texts on numerology and spread them to the western world due to their trade links with them  The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals  as they learned from them  Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India  It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit–Devanagari notation  which is still used in India   The simplest numeral system is the unary numeral system  in which every natural number is represented by a corresponding number of symbols  If the symbol   is chosen  for example  then the number seven would be represented by          Tally marks represent one such system still in common use  The unary system is only useful for small numbers  although it plays an important role in theoretical computer science  Elias gamma coding  which is commonly used in data compression  expresses arbitrary sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral   The unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values  Very commonly  these values are powers of 10  so for instance  if   stands for one  − for ten and + for 100  then the number 304 can be compactly represented as +++      and the number 123 as + − −     without any need for zero  This is called sign value notation  The ancient Egyptian numeral system was of this type  and the Roman numeral system was a modification of this idea   More useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols  for example  using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations  with A standing for  one occurrence   B  two occurrences   and so on  one could then write C+ D  for the number 304  This system is used when writing Chinese numerals and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese  The number system of the English language is of this type   three hundred  and  four    as are those of other spoken languages  regardless of what written systems they have adopted  However  many languages use mixtures of bases  and other features  for instance 79 in French is soixante dix neuf    and in Welsh is pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain    or  somewhat archaic  pedwar ugain namyn un     In English  one could say  four score less one   as in the famous Gettysburg Address representing  87 years ago  as  four score and seven years ago    More elegant is a positional system  also known as place value notation  Again working in base 10  ten different digits 0       9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with  as in or more precisely   Note that zero  which is not needed in the other systems  is of crucial importance here  in order to be able to  skip  a power  The Hindu–Arabic numeral system  which originated in India and is now used throughout the world  is a positional base 10 system   Arithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones  furthermore  additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10  a positional system needs only ten different symbols  assuming that it uses base 10    Positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing  The base 1000 is also used  by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit  This is the meaning of the common notation 1 000 234 567 used for very large numbers   In computers  the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base 2  binary numeral system   with two binary digits  0 and 1  Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three  octal numeral system  or four  hexadecimal numeral system  are commonly used  For very large integers  bases 232 or 264  grouping binary digits by 32 or 64  the length of the machine word  are used  as  for example  in GMP   The numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the arithmetic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and the geometric numerals 1  10  100  1000  10000      respectively  The sign value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals  A sign value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition  except for the Ionic system   and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position  However  the spoken language uses both arithmetic and geometric numerals   In certain areas of computer science  a modified base k positional system is used  called bijective numeration  with digits 1  2       k     and zero being represented by an empty string  This establishes a bijection between the set of all such digit strings and the set of non negative integers  avoiding the non uniqueness caused by leading zeros  Bijective base k numeration is also called k adic notation  not to be confused with p adic numbers  Bijective base 1 is the same as unary   2  Positional systems in detail  In a positional base b numeral system  with b a natural number greater than 1 known as the radix   b basic symbols  or digits  corresponding to the first b natural numbers including zero are used  To generate the rest of the numerals  the position of the symbol in the figure is used  The symbol in the last position has its own value  and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by b   For example  in the decimal system  base 10   the numeral 4327 means   noting that    In general  if b is the base  one writes a number in the numeral system of base b by expressing it in the form and writing the enumerated digits in descending order  The digits are natural numbers between 0 and   inclusive   If a text  such as this one  discusses multiple bases  and if ambiguity exists  the base  itself represented in base 10  is added in subscript to the right of the number  like this  numberbase  Unless specified by context  numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal   By using a dot to divide the digits into two groups  one can also write fractions in the positional system  For example  the base 2 numeral 10 11 denotes    In general  numbers in the base b system are of the form   The numbers bk and b−k are the weights of the corresponding digits  The position k is the logarithm of the corresponding weight w  that is   The highest used position is close to the order of magnitude of the number   The number of tally marks required in the unary numeral system for describing the weight would have been w  In the positional system  the number of digits required to describe it is only   for k ≥ 0  For example  to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because   The number of digits required to describe the position is  in positions 1  10  100     only for simplicity in the decimal example    Note that a number has a terminating or repeating expansion if and only if it is rational  this does not depend on the base  A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another  thus    An irrational number stays aperiodic  with an infinite number of non repeating digits  in all integral bases  Thus  for example in base 2  can be written as the aperiodic 11 001001000011111   2   Putting overscores    or dots  ṅ  above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions  Thus   If b   p is a prime number  one can define base p numerals whose expansion to the left never stops  these are called the p adic numbers   3  Generalized variable length integers  More general is using a mixed radix notation  here written little endian  like for   etc   This is used in punycode  one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters  of  digits  from a collection of 36  a–z and 0–9  representing 0–25 and 26–35 respectively  A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most significant digit  hence the end of the number  The threshold value depends on the position in the number  For example  if the threshold value for the first digit is b  i e  1  then a  i e  0  marks the end of the number  it has just one digit   so in numbers of more than one digit the range is only b–9  1–35   therefore the weight b1 is 35 instead of 36  Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c  2   then the third digit has a weight 34 × 35   1190 and we have the following sequence   a  0   ba  1   ca  2       9a  35   bb  36   cb  37       9b  70   bca  71       99a  1260   bcb  1261   etc   Unlike a regular based numeral system  there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35  yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed – the a would terminate the number   The flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes   The case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to bijective numeration  where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non zero   4  See also  5
