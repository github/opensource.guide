Stayman is a bidding convention in the card game contract bridge  It is used by a partnership to find a 4 4 or 5 3 trump fit in a suit after making a one  1NT  opening bid and it has been adapted for use after a 2NT opening  a 1NT overcall  and many other natural notrump bids   The convention is named for Sam Stayman  who wrote the first published description in 1945  but its inventors were two other players  the British expert Jack Marx in 1939  who published it only in 1946  and Stayman s regular partner George Rapée in 1944   1  Rationale  A bid and made in a major suit  i e  4 or 4   scores better than a game contract bid and made in a minor suit  i e  5 or 5   or in notrump  i e  3NT   Also  the success rate for a game contract in a major suit when a partnership has a combined holding of 26 points and eight cards in the major is about 80%  whereas a game contract in 3NT with 26  HCP  has a success rate of only 60%  or 50% with 25 HCP  the success rate for a minor suit game contract when holding 26 points is about 30%   Accordingly  partnership priority is to find an eight card or better major suit fit when jointly holding sufficient values for a game contract  5 3 and 6 2 fits are easy to find in basic methods as responder can bid 3 or 3 over 1NT  and opener will not normally have a 5 card major to bid 1NT  However  finding 4 4 fits presents a problem  The 2 and 2 bids cannot be used for this as they are weak takeouts  a sign off bid   2  Standard Stayman  After an opening bid or an overcall of 1NT  2NT   or bids an artificial 2  3  to ask opener or overcaller if he holds a four or five card major suit  some partnership agreements may require the major to be headed by an honor of at least a specified rank  such as the queen  The artificial club bid typically promises four cards in at least one of the major suits  promissory Stayman  and  in standard form  enough strength to continue bidding after partner s response  8 HCP for an invitational bid opposite a standard strong 1NT opening or overcall showing 15 17 HCP  11 HCP opposite a weak notrump of 12 14 HCP  or 5 HCP to go to game opposite a standard 2NT showing 20 21 points   It also promises distribution that is not 4333  By invoking the Stayman convention  the responder takes control of the bidding since strength and distribution of the opener s hand is already known within a limited range  The opener responds with the following rebids   2  3  denies four or more cards in either major suit   2  3  shows at least four hearts  also meeting the criteria for an honor holding as may be set by partnership agreement    2  3  shows at least four spades  also meeting the criteria for an honor holding as may be set by partnership agreement   A notrump opener should have neither a suit longer than five cards nor more than one 5 card suit since an opening notrump bid shows a balanced hand  A notrump bidder who has at least four cards in each major suit normally responds in hearts  as this still can still allow a spade fit to be found  Variant methods are to bid the longer or stronger major  with a preference given to spades  or to use 2NT to show both majors   In the standard form of Stayman over 1NT  the responder has a number of options depending on his partner s answer   If the notrump opener names a major suit and the responder has four cards in that suit  the responder bids three of the notrump bidder s suit  invitational  with 8 9 HCP or four of the notrump bidder s major suit  game  with 10 or more HCP   If the notrump bidder bids a major suit in which the responder does not have at least four cards  the responder may bid 2NT  invitational  with 8 9 HCP or 3NT  game  with 10 or more HCP  However  if responder has 5 cards in the unnamed major  he may bid it at a convenient level in an attempt to find a 5 3 fit   If the notrump bidder bids 2  denying a 4 card major  responder may bid his 5 card major with a call of 2 of his major with 8 9 HCP  or with a call of 3 of his major with 10 HCP  This allows notrump bidder to find game in a major with a 5 3 split  Otherwise  opener has the option to retreat to the appropriate notrump contract  Over these bids  the notrump bidder  1  with a maximum hand  17 HCP   goes to game over an invitational bid and  2  with four  or more  cards in each major suit  corrects to the previously unbid major suit   In the standard form of Stayman over 2NT  the responder has only two normal rebids   If the notrump bidder names a major suit and the responder has four cards in that suit  the responder bids four of the notrump bidder s suit  game    If the notrump bidder names a major suit in which the responder does not have at least four cards or bids diamonds to deny a major suit  the responder bids 3NT  game   If the notrump bidder has four cards in each major suit  the notrump bidder corrects to the previously unbid major suit  In either case  a responder who rebids notrump over a response in a major suit promises four cards of the other major suit  Thus  a notrump opener who holds at least four cards in each major suit should  correct  by bidding the other major suit at the lowest level   Of course  once a fit is found  responder who has sufficient strength also may bid 4  Gerber  or 4NT  Blackwood   or cue bid aces  depending upon partnership agreement  to explore slam in any of the above sequences  Some partnerships also admit responder s rebids of a major suit that the notrump bidder did not name   A bid of 4 over an opening bid of 3NT may be either Stayman or Gerber  depending upon the partnership agreement   If an adverse suit bid is inserted immediately after a 1NT opening  Stayman may be employed via a double  by partnership agreement  or a cue bid  depending on the strength of his hand  The cue bid  which is conventional  is completely artificial and means nothing other than invoking Stayman  For example  if South opens 1NT  and West overcalls 2  North  if he has adequate values  may call 3  invoking Stayman  South would then show his major or bid game in notrump  Alternatively  North  if his hand lacks the values for game in notrump  may double  which by partnership agreement employs Stayman  This keeps the Stayman bidding at second level   Partnerships who have not yet learned Stayman but choose to adopt Stayman  without having yet learned or having chosen not to use Jacoby Transfers  will need to adjust their use of normal level 2 responses after a 1NT opening  because the availability of this convention changes the nature of what had been normal 1 NT responses  When the notrump bidder s partner does not invoke Stayman but instead calls 2 or 2  it is a sign of relative weakness  since if responder held 8 HCP or more  he would have invoked Stayman   These bids are commonly referred to as  drop dead bids   as the opening notrump bidder is requested to withdraw from the auction  If opener has maximum values  a fit  and strong support  he may raise to the 3 level  but under no circumstances may he take any other action  This provides the partnership with an advantage that the non Stayman partnership doesn t enjoy  For example  a responder may have no honors at all  that is  a total of zero HCP  His partner is likely to be set if he passes  A non Stayman responder would have to pass  because to bid would provoke a rebid  But a Stayman responder can respond to his partner s 1NT opening at level 2 if he has a 6 card non club suit  The responder with 3 HCP and a singleton can make a similar call with a 5 card non club suit  This gives the partnership a better than even chance of success in making the contract  whereas without a response  and without Stayman   the contract would likely be set   Similarly  a response of 2 Diamonds indicates less than 8 HCP and should usually be passed  In rare cases  when the opener has maximum values and a fit in Diamonds with at least two of the top three honors  he may raise Diamonds  and responder may see a chance for game in notrump   There are many variations on this basic theme  and partnership agreement may alter the details of its use  It is one of the most widely used conventions in bridge   2 1  Non promissory Stayman and 2 checkback by responder  Some partnerships play that 2 Stayman does not absolutely promise a four card major  non promissory Stayman   For example  if responder has a short suit and wishes to know if opener has four card cover in it  so as to play in notrumps  If opener shows hearts initially  2 can be used to find a fit in spades when the 2 does not promise a four card major   1NT   2  2    2   four spades  not four hearts  invitational  2NT   no four spades  invitational  3NT   four spades and game values Alternatively 2 can be used for all hands with four spades and not four hearts  either invitational or game values  while 3NT denies four spades   3  Using Jacoby transfers with Stayman  Today  most players use Stayman in conjunction with Jacoby transfers  With Stayman in effect  the responder practically denies having a five card major  as otherwise he would transfer to the major immediately  The only exception is when responder has 5 4 in the majors  in that case  he could use Stayman  and in the case of a 2 response  bid the five card major at the two level  weakness take out   Garbage Stayman  or at the three level  forcing to game   However  the latter hand can also be bid by first using a transfer and then showing the second suit naturally  The Smolen convention provides an alternative method to show a five card major and game going values  A minor drawback of Jacoby transfers is that a 2 contract is not possible   4  Smolen convention  The Smolen convention is an adjunct to Stayman for situations in which the notrump opener has denied holding a four card major and responder has a five card major and a four card major with game going values   If the notrump opener responds to the Stayman 2 asking bid with 2  denying a four card major  responder initiates the Smolen Transfer with a jump shift to three of his four card major  The jump shift shows which is the four card major and promises five in the other major  The notrump opener then bids four of the other major with three cards in the suit or 3NT with fewer than three   Smolen may also be used when responder has a six card major and a four card major with game going values  after the 2 negative response by opener  responder double jump shifts to four in the suit just below his six card major and the notrump opener transfers to four of his partner s six card major   This convention allows a partnership to find either a 5 3 fit  6 3 and 6 2 fit while ensuring that the notrump opener  who has the stronger hand  will be declarer   5  Garbage Stayman and Crawling Stayman   Garbage  Stayman  or  Weak Stayman   and  Crawling  Stayman are adaptations of Stayman frequently used for damage control when holding a weak hand opposite a 1NT opening bid  Suppose you hold the following hand   Your partner opens 1NT  15 17   and your right hand opponent passes  Now  what   In this scenario  opener has about 16 HCP and the opponents have about 24 HCP  Thus  1NT is virtually certain to go down by at least three or four tricks  Indeed  in Notrump  this dummy will be completely worthless   But consider what happens if you bid 2 Stayman rather than passing on the first round  and then pass opener s response  If opener rebids a major suit you have found a 4 4 fit and ability to trump club losers  or  alternately  to sluff the other major on club winners and then to trump losers in the other major   Likewise  a response of 2 guarantees no worse than a 5 2 fit in diamonds and  with a fifth trump  a potential additional ruff  The ability to reach dummy with a couple ruffs also may allow the declarer to take a couple finesses or execute a squeeze that otherwise would not be possible  and which might yield another trick or two  The result is a contract that will go down fewer tricks or that might even make  especially with a somewhat better hand than the example  rather than a contract that is virtually certain to go down at least three or four tricks  The practice of bidding Stayman with a relatively weak hand of this  or similar  shape and then passing the Notrump bidder s reply is often called  Garbage Stayman  because it is bidding Stayman with a  garbage  hand    Crawling Stayman  is an optional extension of  Garbage Stayman  for situations in which the responder s diamond suit is short  In  Crawling Stayman   the responder rebids 2 over the Notrump bidder s 2 reply  This conventional bid shows a weak hand with at least four cards in each major suit  asking the Notrump bidder to choose between the major suits at the cheapest level by either passing the 2 bid or correcting to 2  The name  Crawling Stayman  comes from the fact that the bidding  crawls  at the slowest possible pace   pass  舑 1NT 舑  pass  舑 2   pass  舑 2 舑  pass  舑 2   pass  舑 2   pass  舑 pass 舑  pass    Alternatively  responder s 2and 2 bids after the 2 rebid can be weak sign offs  This allows responder to effectively bid hands which are 5 4 in the majors  by looking first for a 4 4 fit and  if none is found  signing off in his 5 card suit    Garbage Stayman  and  Crawling Stayman  bids over a 2NT bid work the same way  but occur at the  three  level   6  Forcing and Non Forcing Stayman  If Jacoby transfers are not played  there are two approaches to resolve the situation when responder has a 5 card major but only invitational values  In one  more common  referred to as non forcing Stayman  in the sequence   responder s simple rebid of a major suit is only invitational  showing 8 9 points and a 5 card spade suit  In the forcing Stayman variant  the bid is one round forcing   In the original Precision Club system  forcing and non forcing Stayman are differentiated in the start  2 by responder shows only invitational values  and the continuation is the same as in basic Stayman   while 2 is forcing to game  responder bids 2NT without majors    7  Non Promissory Game Forcing Stayman  This allows responder to find exact shape of 1NT opener  Developed for use with weak 1 NT opening  Relay bids over opener s rebids of 2  2  2  2NT  3 allow shape to be defined further if attempting to find 5 3 major fits  Advantages are responder s shape  which may be any distribution  is undisclosed  and responder is able to locate suit shortage holdings not suitable for no trumps  Disadvantage is 2 can t be used as a damage control bid   1NT – 2♣  2 5 3 3 2 shape with 5 diamonds  2 4 4 3 2 shape with 4 hearts  2 4 4 3 2 shape with 4 spades  denies 4 hearts   2NT 4 4 3 2 shape with both 4

Stayman  This allows responder to find exact shape of 1NT opener  Developed for use with weak 1 NT opening  Relay bids over opener s rebids of 2  2  2 allow shape to be defined further if attempting to find 5 3 major fits  Advantages are responder s shape  which may be any distribution  is undisclosed  and responder is able to locate suit shortage holdings not suitable for no trumps  May be also

is possible that opener s 1NT or 2NT might include a five card major  As described by Australian Ron Klinger  it can be played with a weak or strong 1NT   1NT   2  2   minimum  no 5M  2M   minimum  5M  2NT   Maximum  no 5M  3M   Maximum  5M 1NT   2  2 OR 2NT  3   Stayman  3        3        3      3NT   to play After a transfer  accept it with any 4333  bid 3NT with only two trumps  otherwise bid 4M

alternative  simpler version of 5 card Stayman is   1NT   2  2   No 5CM  2M   5CM This structure permits use by weak hands with 5+ diamonds and 2+ cards in each major   After 1NT   2  2  2M   4M invitational  2NT   invitational  no major  3M   4M game forcing If responder has a five card major  he begins with a transfer  After completion of the transfer  bidding the other major at the three level shows four cards in it and a game forcing hand  in line with the 1NT   2  2 structure above  1NT   2  2   2   invitational 5 4    Similarly after 2NT   3  3  3M   4M  3NT   no major A drawback of Five Card Major Stayman  particularly the simpler version  is that the weaker hand may become declarer in a 4 4 major fit   10  Puppet Stayman  Puppet Stayman is similar to Five Card Stayman  It is more complex but has the major advantage that the strong hand virtually always becomes declarer   Initially developed by Neil Silverman and refined by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson in 1977 78  is a variation of the Stayman convention designed to find a 5 3 fit in a major  augmenting the search for a 4 4 major fit by standard Stayman  In 1977  Woolsey wrote that Puppet Stayman has several advantages over standard Stayman   Opener is usually better placed than responder to choose the proper denomination given distributional information about his partner s hand  Opener becomes declarer in most cases without revealing his distribution  it being deemed less injurious to reveal responder s distribution  usually the weaker of the two hands  The side can stop in two diamonds  Since opener can show a 5 card major immediately in response to the two club bid  it is less dangerous to open 1NT with a 5 card major  It is possible to stop at two spades with a 4 4 fit  e g  1NT   2  2   2  2   All Pass  Opener may be able to perceive a weakness for a notrump contract and so save to three of a minor or a good 4 3 major suit game instead  It is possible that a 3NT contract may be preferred over a 4 4 major fit in certain auctions  10 1  Responder s rebids  As in standard Stayman  Puppet Stayman begins with a 2 response to a 1NT opening and is at least game invitational  this asks opener to bid a 5 card major if he has one and otherwise to bid 2  Over a 2 response  rebids by responder are intended to dislose his distributional features in the majors as well as his strength  The original 1977 and 1978 revised rebids described by Woolsey are tabulated below   Opener and responder continue the bidding having a clearer understanding of each other s distributional features and are better positioned to select the ultimate and level of the contract   10 2  Modern applications  Many variations to the Puppet Stayman bidding structure have been devised since Woolsey s 1978 summary  partnership review and agreement on the preferred modern treatment is required   Some no longer advocate use of Puppet Stayman over a 1NT opening preferring to use the concept exclusively over a 2NT opening and reserving other Stayman variations and conventions such Jacoby Transfers and Smolen Transfers in search of major suit fits after a 1NT opening   10 3  Responses to a 2NT opening or rebid  Puppet Stayman is more commonly used after a 2NT opening than after a 1NT opening  Responses to a 2NT opening or very strong 2NT rebid  20 22 or 23 24    3   Puppet Stayman  3       hearts  3       spades  3       5 spades and 4 hearts  3NT   no 3+ major  to play Responder bids 3 seeking information about opener s major suit holding  Opener replies   3NT denying a 4 or 5 card major  3 showing a 5 card heart suit  3 showing a 5 card spade suit  3 holding a 4 card major and denying a 5 card major  following this responder bids   3 showing a 4 card spade suit and denying a 4 card heart suit  3 showing a 4 card heart suit and denying a 4 card spade suit  3NT denying a 4 card major  to play  4 showing 4 spades and 4 hearts  slam try  4 RKCB in hearts  4 to play  4 to play  4NT RKCB in spades  4 showing 4 spades and 4 hearts  you choose  4NT denying a 4 card major  invitational to 6NT By this means all 5 3 and 4 4 major suit fits can be found   An alternative pattern frees up the 2NT 3 sequence as a slam try in the minors  To allow 3 5 spade fits to be found when responder holds 5 spades and 4 hearts  some of the responses change   After 2NT 3  opener s 3 denies a 5 card major but promises 4 hearts or 3 or 4 spades  Following this  responder bids   3 showing a 4 card spade suit  possibly including a 4 card heart suit  or 5 spades and 4 hearts  Opener s rebids   3   showing 3 spades and denying 4 hearts  responder now bids 4 with 5S4H  or 3NT otherwise  3NT   showing 4 hearts and denying 4 spades  responder now leaves in NT or converts to 4 with a 4 card heart suit  4   showing 4 spades   3 showing a 4 card heart suit and denying a 4 card spade suit  responder converts to 3NT or 4 as appropriate  3NT denying a 4 card major  to play   11  Checkback Stayman  2 Checkback Stayman  or simply Checkback  is used after a 1NT rebid by opener rather than a 1NT opening  It is used to  check back  if opener has major suit support  saying nothing additional about the club suit  It can find 3 5 fits  4 4 fits  in Standard American  and 5 3 fits  in Acol   and also shows whether opener was maximum or minimum strength for his notrump bid  In five card major systems  bidding Checkback implies that the responder has five cards in his major  and may have four in the other   1m   1M   1NT   2  The 2 is Checkback Stayman  Responses are as follows   Partnership agreement is required on how to handle the case of holding four of the other major and three of partner s suit  One could agree to bid up the line  or support partner s suit first  If partner cannot support your first suit  he will invite with 2NT or bid game with 3NT and you will then correct to your other suit   In Acol  if the opening bid was a major  opener can rebid his major after a Checkback inquiry to show that it has five cards rather than four and find 5 3 fits  Moreover 1M 2m 2N 3 can also be used as Checkback Stayman  It is useful also to include an indication of range  particularly if opener s 2NT rebid is forcing to game and shows a wide points range  15 19   This is achieved by using 3 for minimum hands and 3 3 3NT for maximum hands  or vice versa  After 3  responder can still bid 3 3 to look for a 5 3 fit   12  New Minor Forcing  New Minor Forcing is an alternative to Checkback Stayman where either 2 or 2 can be used as the checkback bid  It can be used by responder with invitational values or more to find 3 card support for his major or find a 4 4 heart fit  holding 5 spades and 4 hearts   it also allows a return to the minor to play   2 of the other minor is New Minor Forcing  NMF    Your responses to NMF in order of priority are   Show 3 card support for partner s suit  jump to 3 with a maximum   Bid an unbid heart suit with 4  jump to 3 with a maximum   Bid no trump with stoppers in the two unbid suits  jump to 3 with a maximum   Bid an unbid suit  to show a stopper  or rebid your minor without stoppers  13  References  14  Further
