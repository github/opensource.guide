Pasteurization  American English  or Pasteurisation  French  and English  is a process invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century  In 1864 Pasteur discovered that heating beer and wine just enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage prevented these beverages from turning sour  This was achieved by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage  Today the process of pasteurization is used widely in the dairy and food industries for microbial control and preservation of the food we consume    Unlike sterilisation  pasteurization is not intended to kill all micro organisms in the food  Instead  it aims to reduce the number of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease  assuming the pasteurized product is stored as indicated and is consumed before its expiration date   Commercial scale sterilisation of food is not common because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product  Certain foods  such as dairy products  may be superheated to ensure pathogenic microbes are destroyed   1  Alcoholic beverages  The process of heating wine for preservation purposes has been known in China since 1117  and was documented in Japan in the diary Tamonin nikki  written by a series of monks between 1478 and 1618   Much later  in 1768  an Italian priest and scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani proved experimentally that heat killed bacteria  and that they do not re appear if the product is hermetically sealed  In 1795  a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs  succeeding with soups  vegetables  juices  dairy products  jellies  jams  and syrups  He placed the food in glass jars  sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water  In that same year  the French military offered a cash prize of 12 000 francs for a new method to preserve food  After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting  Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810  Later that year  Appert published L Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales  or The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances   This was the first cookbook of its kind on modern food preservation methods   La Maison Appert     in the town of Massy  near Paris  became the first food bottling factory in the world  preserving a variety of food in sealed bottles  Appert s method was to fill thick  large mouthed glass bottles with produce of every description  ranging from beef and fowl to eggs  milk and prepared dishes  His greatest success for publicity was an entire sheep  He left air space at the top of the bottle  and the cork would then be sealed firmly in the jar by using a vice  The bottle was then wrapped in canvas to protect it  while it was dunked into boiling water and then boiled for as much time as Appert deemed appropriate for cooking the contents thoroughly  Appert patented his method  sometimes called in his honor  appertisation    Appert s method was so simple and workable that it quickly became widespread  In 1810  British inventor and merchant Peter Durand  also of French origin  patented his own method  but this time in a tin can  so creating the modern day process of canning foods  In 1812  Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing preserves  Just a decade later  Appert s method of canning had made its way to the USA  Tin can production was however not common until the beginning of the 20th century  partly because a hammer and chisel or bayonet were needed to open cans until the invention of a tin opener by an Englishman named Yates in 1855   Appert s preservation by boiling involved heating the food to an unnecessarily high temperature  and for an unnecessarily long time  which could destroy some of the flavour of the preserved food   A less aggressive method was developed by the French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur during an 1864 summer holiday in Arbois  To remedy the frequent acidity of the local wines  he found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about for a brief time to kill the microbes  and that the wine could subsequently be aged without sacrificing the final quality  In honour of Pasteur  the process became known as  pasteurisation  Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring  and it would be many years before milk was pasteurized  In the United States in the 1870s  it was common for milk to contain contaminants to mask spoilage before milk was regulated   2  Milk  Milk is an excellent medium for microbial growth  and when stored at ambient temperature bacteria and other pathogens soon proliferate   The US Centers for Disease Control  CDC  says improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalisations than any other food borne disease outbreak  making it one of the world s most dangerous food products  Diseases pasteurization can prevent include tuberculosis  brucellosis  diphtheria  scarlet fever  and Q fever  it also kills the harmful bacteria Salmonella  Listeria  Yersinia  Campylobacter  Staphylococcus aureus  and Escherichia coli O157 H7  among others   Pasteurization is the reason for milk s extended shelf life  High temperature  short time  HTST  pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks  whereas ultra pasteurized milk can last much longer  sometimes two to three months  When ultra heat treatment  UHT  is combined with sterile handling and container technology  such as aseptic packaging   it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months   2 1  History  Before the widespread urban growth caused by industrialisation  people kept dairy cows even in urban areas and the short time period between production and consumption minimised the disease risk of drinking raw milk  However  as urban densities increased and supply chains lengthened to the distance from country to city  raw milk  often days old  began to be recognised as a source of disease  For example  between 1912 and 1937 some 65 000 people died of tuberculosis contracted from consuming milk in England and Wales alone   Developed countries adopted milk pasteurization to prevent such disease and loss of life  and as a result milk is now widely considered one of the safest foods  A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the keeping qualities of butter was practiced in England before 1773 and was introduced to Boston in the USA by 1773  although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years  It was still being referred to as a  new  process in American newspapers as late as 1802  Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886  In early 20th century  Milton Joseph Rosenau  established the standards  i e  low temperature  slow heating at 60 °C  140 °F  for 20 minutes  for the pasteurization of milk  while at the United States Marine Hospital Service  notably in his publication of The Milk Question  1912    2 2  Process  Older pasteurization methods used temperatures below boiling  since at very high temperatures  casein micelles will irreversibly aggregate  or  curdle   Newer methods use higher temperature  but shorten the time  Among the pasturization methods listed below  the two main types of pasteurization used today are high temperature  short time  HTST  also known as  flash   and extended shelf life  ESL    HTST milk is forced between metal plates or through pipes heated on the outside by hot water  and the milk is heated to 72 °C  161 °F  for 15 seconds  Milk simply labeled  pasteurized  is usually treated with the HTST method   UHT  also known as ultra heat treating  processing holds the milk at a temperature of 140 °C  284 °F  for four seconds  During UHT processing milk is sterilized and not pasteurized  This process allows milk or juice to be stored several months without refrigeration  The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber that is filled with high temperature steam under pressure  After the temperature reaches 140 °C the fluid is cooled instantly in a vacuum chamber  and packed in a presterilized airtight container  Milk labeled  ultra pasteurized  or simply  UHT  has been treated with the UHT method   ESL milk has a microbial filtration step and lower temperatures than UHT milk  Since 2007  it is no longer a legal requirement in European countries  for example in Germany  to declare ESL milk as ultra heated  consequently  it is now often labeled as  fresh milk  and just advertised as having an  extended shelf life   making it increasingly difficult to distinguish ESL milk from traditionally pasteurized fresh milk   A less conventional  but US FDA legal  alternative  typically for home pasteurization  is to heat milk at for 30 minutes  Pasteurization methods are usually standardized and controlled by national food safety agencies  such as the USDA in the United States and the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom   These agencies require that milk be HTST pasteurized to qualify for the pasteurized label  Dairy product standards differ  depending on fat content and intended usage  For example  pasteurization standards for cream differ from standards for fluid milk  and standards for pasteurizing cheese are designed to preserve the enzyme phosphatase  which aids cutting  In Canada  all milk produced at a processor and intended for consumption must be pasteurized  which legally requires that it be heated to at least 72 °C for at least 16 seconds  then cooling it to 4 °C to ensure any harmful bacteria are destroyed  The UK Dairy Products Hygiene Regulations 1995 requires that milk be heat treated for 15 seconds at 71 7 °C or other effective time temperature combination   A process similar to pasteurization is thermization  which uses lower temperatures to kill bacteria in milk  It allows a milk product  such as cheese  to retain more of the original taste  but thermized foods are not considered pasteurized by food regulators   2 3  Microwave Volumetric Heating  Microwave Volumetric Heating  MVH  is the newest available pasteurization technology  It uses microwaves to heat liquids  suspensions  or semi solids in a continuous flow  Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product  it allows for gentler and shorter heating  so that almost all heat sensitive substances in the milk are preserved   2 4  Efficiency  The HTST pasteurization standard was designed to achieve a five log reduction  killing 99 999% of the number of viable micro organisms in milk  This is considered adequate for destroying almost all yeasts  molds  and common spoilage bacteria and also to ensure adequate destruction of common pathogenic  heat resistant organisms  including Mycobacterium tuberculosis  which causes tuberculosis  but not Coxiella burnetii  which causes Q fever   As a precaution  modern equipment tests and identifies bacteria in milk being processed  HTST pasteurization processes must be designed so the milk is heated evenly  and no part of the milk is subject to a shorter time or a lower temperature   Even pasteurization without quality control can be effective  though this is generally not permitted for human consumption  a study of farms feeding calves on pasteurized waste milk using a mixture of pasteurization technologies  none of which were routinely monitored for performance  found the resulting pasteurized milk to meet safety requirements at least 92% of the time   An effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin  mineral  and beneficial  or probiotic  bacteria is lost  Soluble calcium and phosphorus levels decrease by 5%  thiamine  vitamin B1  and vitamin B12  cobalamin  levels by 10%  and vitamin C levels by 20%  However  these losses are not significant nutritionally   2 5  Verification  Direct microbiological techniques are the ultimate measurement of pathogen contamination but these are costly and time consuming  24–48 hours   which means that products are able to spoil by the time pasteurization is verified   As a result of the unsuitability of microbiological techniques  milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase  which is denatured by pasteurization  B  tuberculosis  the bacterium requiring the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at similar ranges of temperature and time as those which denature alkaline phosphatase  For this reason  presence of alkaline phosphatase is deemed to be an ideal diagnostic tool for pasteurization efficacy   Phosphatase denaturing was originally monitored using a phenol phosphate substrate  When hydrolysed by the enzyme these compounds liberate phenols  which were then reacted with dibromoquinonechlorimide to give a colour change  which itself was measured by checking absorption at 610 nm  spectrophotometry   Some of the phenols used were inherently coloured  phenolpthalein  nitrophenol  and were simply assayed unreacted  Spectrophotometric analysis is satisfactory but is of relatively low accuracy because many natural products are coloured  For this reason  modern systems  since 1990  use fluorometry which is able to detect much lower levels of raw milk contamination   2 6  Unpasteurized milk  According to the United States Centers for Disease Control between 1998 and 2011 79% of the dairy related outbreaks were due to raw milk or cheese products  They report 148 outbreaks  2 384 illnesses  284 requiring hospitalizations  as well as 2 deaths due to raw milk or cheese products during the same time period   3  Consumer acceptance  As pasteurization is a very old and traditional way of preservation  it is well known and accepted by consumers  Nearly every label of milk products contains the word  pasteurization  and it is associated by consumers with good quality attributes and safety  In the consumer studies of Hightech Europe consumers mentioned more positive than negative associations for this technology showing that these products are well accepted
