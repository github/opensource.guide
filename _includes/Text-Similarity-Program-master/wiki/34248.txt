Politics of Yemen takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic  where the President of Yemen is the head of state  while the Prime Minister of Yemen  who is appointed by the President  is the head of government  Although it is notionally a multi party system  in reality it is completely dominated by one party  the General People s Congress  and has been since unification  Executive power is exercised by the government  Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament  The Judiciary is theoretically independent but in reality it is prone to interference from the executive branch   Yemen is a republic with a bicameral legislature  Under the constitution  an elected president  an elected 301 seat House of Representatives  and an appointed 111 member Shura Council share power  The president is head of state  and the prime minister is head of government  The constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by Parliament  the prime minister is appointed by the president  The presidential term of office is 7 years  and the parliamentary term of elected office is 6 years  Suffrage is universal over 18   1  Political background  For hundreds of years Yemen was ruled by imams who had absolute powers on the political process in the country  The imams of Yemen and later the Kings of Yemen were religiously consecrated leaders belonging to the Zaidiyyah branch of Shia Islam  They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen from 897  Their imamate endured under varying circumstances until the republican revolution in 1962  Zaidiyyah theology differed from Ismailis or Twelver Shi ites by stressing the presence of an active and visible imam as leader  This came to an end with the assassination of Imam Yehia  His son  Imam Badr succeeded him but the political situation deteriorated with the beginning of the North Yemen Civil War in 1962 with the overthrow of Imam Badr and the setting of a new  Republican regime   While In the North  during the civil war  the pro monarch and pro republican forces fought for power  the South of Yemen was under British control  During the 1960s  the British sought to incorporate all of the Aden Protectorate territories into the Federation  On 18 January 1963  the Colony of Aden was incorporated against the wishes of much of the city s populace as the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia  Several more states subsequently joined the Federation and the remaining states that declined to join  mainly in Hadhramaut  formed the Protectorate of South Arabia  In 1963 fighting between Egyptian forces and British led Saudi financed guerrillas in the Yemen Arab Republic spread to South Arabia with the formation of the National Liberation Front  NLF   who hoped to force the British out of South Arabia  Hostilities started with a grenade attack by the NLF against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963  killing one person and injuring fifty  and a state of emergency was declared  becoming known as the Aden Emergency  In 1964  the new British government under Harold Wilson announced their intention to hand over power to the Federation of South Arabia in 1968  but that the British military would remain  In 1964  there were around 280 guerrilla attacks and over 500 in 1965  In 1966 the British Government announced that all British forces would be withdrawn at independence  In response  the security situation deteriorated with the creation of the socialist Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen  FLOSY  which started to attack the NLF in a bid for power  as well as attacking the British  With the British being defeated and driven from Aden by the end of November 1967  earlier than had been planned by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and without an agreement on the succeeding governance  Their enemies  the NLF  managed to seize power  with Aden itself under NLF control  The Royal Marines  who had been the first British troops to occupy Aden in 1839  were the last to leave  The Federation of South Arabia collapsed and Southern Yemen became independent as the People s Republic of South Yemen   Following the Yemen suffers from a highly fractured political landscape  which is the legacy of the regime of President Ali Abd Allah Saleh  who came to power in 1978 and formally resigned his office in February 2012   1 1  Reunification  The Republic of Yemen  ROY  was declared on 22 May 1990 with Saleh becoming President and al Baidh Vice President  For the first time in centuries  much of Greater Yemen was politically united  A 30 month transitional period for completing the unification of the two political and economic systems was set  A presidential council was jointly elected by the 26 member YAR advisory council and the 17 member PDRY presidium  The presidential council appointed a Prime Minister  who formed a Cabinet  There was also a 301 seat provisional unified parliament  consisting of 159 members from the north  111 members from the south  and 31 independent members appointed by the chairman of the council   A unity constitution was agreed upon in May 1990 and ratified by the populace in May 1991  It affirmed Yemen s commitment to free elections  a multiparty political system  the right to own private property  equality under the law  and respect of basic human rights  Parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 1993  International groups assisted in the organization of the elections and observed actual balloting  The resulting Parliament included 143 GPC  69 YSP  63 Islaah  Yemeni grouping for reform  a party composed of various tribal and religious groups   six Baathis  three Nasserists  two Al Haq  and 15 independents  The head of Islaah  Paramount Hashid Sheik Abdallah Bin Husayn Al Ahmar  is the speaker of Parliament   In late 1991 through early 1992  deteriorating economic conditions led to significant domestic unrest  including several riots  Legislative elections were nonetheless held in early 1993  and in May the two former ruling parties  the GPC and the YSP  merged to create a single political party with an overall majority in the new House of Representatives  In August Vice President al Baydh exiled himself voluntarily to Aden  and the country’s general security situation deteriorated as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the widespread unrest  In January 1994  representatives of the main political parties signed a document of pledge and accord in Amman  Jordan  that was designed to resolve the ongoing crisis  Despite this  clashes intensified until civil war broke out in early May 1994   1 2  Yemeni uprising  The 2011 Yemeni protests followed the initial stages of the Arab Spring and began simultaneously with the Egyptian Revolution  The protests were initially against unemployment  economic conditions and corruption  as well as against the government s proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen  The protestors  demands then escalated to calls for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign   The situation however quickly deteriorated into a widescale uprising  with various insurgency campaigns consolidating into an armed tribal struggles  both between the armed opposition and terror groups vs  the government and among themselves  Eventually Saudi brokered agreement on Saleh s resignation and 2012 Presidential election saw the installation of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi as an interim President  Hadi has been presiding over political reform and national reconciliation and was supposed to serve only two years in the post  On November 2013 U N  envoy Jamal Benomar told The Associated Press Hadi will remain president after February 2014 because the transition is not likely to be completed earlier due to  obstruction  from former regime loyalists   1 3  Houthi insurgency  In northern Yemen  where a large Shi’a Zaydi population lives  Saleh s regime has for decades alienated this community through discriminatory religious and political policies  Saleh  with the help of some elements in Saudi Arabia  had promoted strongly anti Zaydi groups of Salafi Muslims in this region  Feeling beleaguered and marginalized  the Zaydis organized themselves politically in the early 2000s under the aegis of a family of religious scholars called the Houthis  They began by criticizing Saleh’s pro U S  policies  which led to armed confrontation and a series of wars with the Yemeni army  This ultimately dragged the Saudi Arabian military into the fray  leading to considerable property destruction and a large refugee problem  In 2011  as Saleh s power waned in the provinces as a result of the uprising against him  the Houthis took control over large areas of the north  but still remain outside the political framework of government   2  Executive branch  The President is elected by direct  popular vote for a seven year term  The vice president  prime minister and deputy prime ministers are appointed by the President  The Council of Ministers is appointed by the President on the advice of the prime minister  President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been head of state in Unified Yemen since 1990  since 1978 in North Yemen  and was democratically elected in 1999  In the September 2006 presidential elections Saleh was challenged by a coalition of five leading opposition parties  the Joint Meeting Parties  JMP   which fronted the candidate Faisal bin Shamlan  President Saleh was reported to have decided in 2005 not to run for another term in office  but was later convinced by a public demonstration calling him to continue as leader of the country to run again   President  Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi  General People s Congress  23 November 2011     Prime Minister  Khaled Bahah  Independent  9 November 2014     3  Legislative branch  The Assembly of Representatives  Majlis al Nuwaab  has 301 members  elected for a six year term in single seat constituencies  In May 1997  the president created a Consultative Council  sometimes referred to as the upper house of Parliament  its 59 members are all appointed by the president  The president of the Consultative Council was Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani prior to his death in August 2011   4  Political parties and elections  In April 2003 parliamentary elections  the General People s Congress  GPC  maintained an absolute majority  International observers described the elections as  another significant step forward on Yemen’s path toward democracy  however  sustained and forceful efforts must be undertaken to remedy critical flaws in the country’s election and political processes   There were some problems with underage voting  confiscation of ballot boxes  voter intimidation  and election related violence  moreover  the political opposition in Yemen has little access to the media  since most outlets are owned or otherwise controlled by the government   The 2006 elections were described in positive wording  and the elections were monitored by a number of international observers  The EU s Election Observation Mission to Yemen has published this final report on the elections  Yemeni media reported on the 22 01 2007 that the opposition coalition JMP has set up a Shadow government  to play an effective role in the political  economic and social life   The ruling party GPC called upon the opposition to  acquaint themselves with constitutional systems before starting to talk every now and then about   rosy dreams and illusions    5  Judicial branch  The constitution calls for an independent judiciary  The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified  The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sanaá  The Quran is the basis for all laws  and no law may contradict it  Indeed many court cases are debated by the religious basis of the laws i e  by interpretations of the Quran  For this reason  many judges are religious scholars as well as legal authorities   6  Administrative divisions  Yemen is divided in 17 governorates  muhafazat  singular   muhafazah   Abyan   Adan  Al Bayda   Al Hudaydah  Al Jawf  Al Mahrah  Al Mahwit   Ataq  Dhamar  Hadhramawt  Hajjah  Ibb  Lahij  Ma rib  Sa dah  San a   Ta izz  There may be four new governorates   the capital city of Sanaa  Amran  Dala a  Raimah   7  Provincial and local government  Formal government authority is centralized in the capital city of Sanaa  Yemen’s Local Authority Law decentralized authority by establishing locally elected district and governorate councils  last elected in September 2006   formerly headed by government appointed governors  After the September 2006 local and governorate council elections  President Salih announced various measures that would enable future governors and directors of the councils to be directly elected  In May 2008  governors were elected for the first time  However  because the ruling party  the General People’s Congress  GPC   continues to dominate the local and governorate councils  the May 2008 elections retained this party’s executive authority over the governorates  In rural Yemen  direct state control is weak  with tribal confederations acting as autonomous sub states   8  See also  Foreign relations of Yemen  Constitution of Yemen  2011 Yemeni protests  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  AQAP   State feminism
