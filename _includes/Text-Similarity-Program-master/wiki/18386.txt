Laconia     also known as Lacedaemonia  is a region in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula  Its administrative capital is Sparta  The word  laconic  is derived from the name of the region by analogy—to speak in a concise way  as the Spartans were reputed by the Athenians to do   1  Geography  Laconia is bordered by Messenia to the west and Arcadia to the north and is surrounded by the Myrtoan Sea to the east and by the Laconian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea to the south  It encompasses Cape Malea and Cape Tainaron and a large part of the Mani Peninsula  The islands of Kythira and Antikythera lie to the south  but they administratively belong to the Attica regional unit of islands  The island  Elafonisos  situated between the Laconian mainland and Kythira  is part of Laconia   The Evrotas is the longest river in the prefecture  The valley of the Evrotas is predominantly an agricultural region that contains many citrus groves  olive groves  and pasture lands  It is the location of the largest orange production in the Peloponnese and probably in all of Greece  Lakonia  a brand of orange juice  is based in Amykles   The main mountain ranges are the Taygetus  2 407 m  in the west and the Parnon  1 961 m  in the northeast  Taygetus  known as Pentadaktylos  five fingers  throughout the Middle Ages  is west of Sparta and the Evrotas valley  It is the highest mountain in Laconia and the Peloponnese and is mostly covered with pine trees  Two roads join the Messenia and Laconia prefectures  one is a tortuous mountain pass through Taygetus and the other bypasses the mountain via the Mani district to the south   The stalactite cave  Dirou  a major tourist attraction  is located south of Areopolis in the southwest of Laconia   1 1  Climate  Laconia has

of the Spartan state  Throughout classical antiquity  the Spartan sphere of influence expanded to Messenia  whose inhabitants  the Helots  were permanently enslaved  Significant archaeological recovery exists at the Vaphio tomb site in Laconia  Found here are advanced Bronze Age art as well as evidence of cultural associations with the co temperaneous Minoan culture on Crete  Laconia was at war with the Kingdom of Macedonia and saw several battles  at the end of the Mycenaean period  population of Laconia sharply declined  From the early 2nd century BC until 395  it was a part of the Roman Empire   4 2  Medieval history  In the medieval period  Laconia formed part of the Byzantine Empire  Following the Fourth Crusade  it was gradually conquered by the Frankish Principality of Achaea  In the 1260s  however  the Byzantines recovered Mystras and other fortresses in the region and managed to evict the Franks from Laconia  which became the nucleus of a new Byzantine province  By the mid 14th century  this evolved into the Despotate of Morea  held by the last Greek ruling dynasty  the Palaiologoi  With the fall of the Despotate to the Ottomans in 1460  except for the Mani peninsula  which remained mostly unsubdued  Laconia was conquered as well   4 3  Modern history  With the exception of a 30 year interval of Venetian rule  Laconia remained under Ottoman control until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence of 1821  Following independence  Sparta was selected as the capitol of the modern prefecture  and its economy and agriculture expanded  With the incorporation of the British ruled Ionian Islands into Greece in 1864  Elafonissos became part of the prefecture  After World War II and the Greek Civil War  its population began to somewhat decline  as people moved from the villages toward the larger cities of Greece and abroad   In 1992  a devastating fire ruined the finest olive crops in the northern part of the prefecture  and affected the area of Sellasia along with Oinountas and its surrounding areas  Firefighters  helicopters and planes battled for days to put out the horrific fire   The Mani portion along with Gytheio became famous in Greece for filming episodes of Vendetta  broadcast on Mega Channel throughout Greece and abroad on Mega Cosmos   In early 2006  flooding ruined olive and citrus crops as well as properties and villages along the Evrotas river  In the summer 2006  a terrible fire devastated a part of the Mani Peninsula  ruining forests  crops  and numerous villages   5  Transport  Greek National Road 39
