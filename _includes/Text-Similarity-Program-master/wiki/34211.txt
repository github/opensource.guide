XSLT  Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations  is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents  or other formats such as HTML for web pages  plain text or into XSL Formatting Objects  which may subsequently be converted to other formats  such as PDF PostScript and PNG   The original document is not changed  rather  a new document is created based on the content of an existing one  Typically  input documents are XML files  but anything from which the processor can build an XQuery and XPath Data Model can be used  for example relational database tables  or geographical information systems   XSLT is a Turing complete language  meaning it can specify any computation that can be performed by a computer   1  History  XSLT is influenced by functional languages  and by text based pattern matching languages like SNOBOL and awk  Its most direct predecessor is DSSSL  which did for SGML what XSLT does for XML   XSLT 1 0  XSLT was part of the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  s Extensible Stylesheet Language  XSL  development effort of 1998–1999  a project that also produced XSL FO and XPath  Some members of the standards committee that developed XSLT  including James Clark  the editor  had previously worked on DSSSL  XSLT 1 0 was published as a W3C recommendation in November 1999   XSLT 2 0  after an abortive attempt to create a version 1 1 in 2001  the XSL working group joined forces with the XQuery working group to create XPath 2 0  with a richer data model and type system based on XML Schema  The most recent version is XSLT 2 0  developed under the editorship of Michael Kay  It reached recommendation status in January 2007  As of 2010  however  XSLT 1 0 is still widely used  since 2 0 is not supported natively in web browsers or for environments like LAMP   XSLT 3 0  had a W3C Last Call Working Draft status as of December 2013  The main new features are   Streaming transformations  in previous versions the entire input document had to be read into memory before it could be processed  and output could not be written until processing had finished  although Saxon does have a streaming extension   The working draft allows XML streaming which will be useful for processing documents too large to fit in memory  or when transformations are chained in XML Pipelines   Improvements to the modularity of large stylesheets   Improved handling of dynamic errors with  for example  an xsl try instruction   Functions can now be arguments to other  higher order  functions   2  Design and processing model  The XSLT processor takes one or more XML source documents  plus one or more XSLT stylesheets  and processes them to produce an output document  In contrast to widely implemented imperative programming languages like C  XSLT is declarative  This makes a given XSLT program more resilient to change to the input it is likely to receive  useful in a language used for information processing applications  The basic processing paradigm is pattern matching  Rather than listing an imperative sequence of actions to perform in a stateful environment  template rules only define how to handle a node matching a particular XPath like pattern  if the processor should happen to encounter one  and the contents of the templates effectively comprise functional expressions that directly represent their evaluated form  the result tree  which is the basis of the processor s output   The processor follows a fixed algorithm  First  assuming a stylesheet has already been read and prepared  the processor builds a source tree from the input XML document  It then processes the source tree s root node  finds the best matching template for that node in the stylesheet  and evaluates the template s contents  Instructions in each template generally direct the processor to either create nodes in the result tree  or to process more nodes in the source tree in the same way as the root node  Output derives from the result tree   3  Processor implementations  Altova RaptorXML Server  cross platform engine that supports XSLT 1 0 and 2 0  most of XPath 3 0  and some features from the XSLT 3 0 working draft

and for Java and C++   Web browsers  Safari  Chrome  Firefox  Opera and Internet Explorer all support XSLT 1 0  None supports XSLT 2 0 natively  although the third party products like Saxon CE and Frameless can provide this functionality  Browsers can perform on the fly transformations of XML files and display the transformation output in the browser window  This is done either by embedding the XSL in the XML document or by referencing a file containing XSL instructions from the XML document  The latter may not work with Chrome because of its security model   XMLStarlet is  a set of command

xpath are XSLT 1 0 processors written in Common Lisp   3 1  Performance  Most early XSLT processors were interpreters  More recently  code generation is increasingly common  using portable intermediate languages  such as Java bytecode or  NET Common Intermediate Language  as the target  However  even the interpretive products generally offer separate analysis and execution phases  allowing an optimized expression tree to be created in memory and reused to perform multiple transformations  This gives substantial performance benefits in online publishing applications  where the same transformation is applied many times per second to different source documents  This separation is reflected in the design of XSLT processing APIs  such as JAXP    Early XSLT processors had very few optimizations  Stylesheet documents were read into Document Object Models and the processor would act on them directly  XPath engines were also not optimized  Increasingly  however  XSLT processors use optimization techniques found in functional programming languages and database query languages  such as static rewriting of an expression tree  e g   to move calculations out of loops   and lazy pipelined evaluation to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate results  and allow  early exit  when the processor can evaluate an expression such as following sibling  * 1  without a complete evaluation of all subexpressions   Many processors also use tree representations that are significantly more efficient  in both space and time  than general purpose DOM implementations   In June 2014  Debbie Lockett and Michael Kay introduced an open source benchmarking framework for XSLT processors called XT Speedo   4  XSLT and XPath  XSLT uses XPath to identify subsets of the source document tree and perform calculations  XPath also provides a range of functions  which XSLT itself further augments   XSLT 1 0 uses XPath 1 0  XSLT 2 0 uses XPath 2 0  And XSLT 3 0 uses XPath 3 0  In the case of 1 0 and 2 0  the specifications were published on the same date  With 3 0  however  they were no longer synchronized  XPath 3 0 became a Recommendation in April 2014  while XSLT 3 0 was still work in progress   5  XSLT and XQuery compared  XSLT functionalities overlap with those of XQuery  which was initially conceived as a query language for large collections of XML documents   The XSLT 2 0 and XQuery 1 0 standards were developed by separate working groups within W3C  working together to ensure a common approach where appropriate  They share the same data model  type system  and function library  and both include XPath 2 0 as a sublanguage   The two languages  however  are rooted in different traditions and serve the needs of different communities  XSLT was primarily conceived as a stylesheet language whose primary goal was to render XML for the human reader on screen  on the web  as web template language   or on paper  XQuery was primarily conceived as a database query language in the tradition of SQL   Because the two languages originate in different communities  XSLT is stronger in its handling of narrative documents with more flexible structure  while XQuery is stronger in its data handling  for example when performing relational joins   6  XSLT media types  The element can optionally take the attribute media type  which allows one to set the media type  or MIME type  for the resulting output  for example    The XSLT 1 0 recommendation recommends the more general attribute types text xml and application xml since for a long time there was no registered media type for XSLT  During this time text xsl became the de facto standard  In XSLT 1 0 it was not specified how the media type values should be used   With the release of the XSLT 2 0  the W3C recommended the registration of the MIME media type application xslt+xml and it was later registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  Pre 1 0 working drafts of XSLT used text xsl in their embedding examples  and this type was implemented and continues to be promoted by Microsoft in Internet Explorer and MSXML  It is also widely recognized in the xml stylesheet processing instruction by other browsers  In practice  therefore  users wanting to control transformation in the browser using this processing instruction are obliged to use this unregistered media type   7  XSLT examples  Sample of incoming XML document   xml version  1 0      7 1  Example 1  transforming XML to XML   This XSLT stylesheet provides templates to transform the XML document    xml version  1 0  encoding  UTF 8     Its evaluation results in a new XML document  having another structure     xml version  1 0  encoding  UTF 8     7 2  Example 2  transforming XML to XHTML   Processing the following example XSLT file   xml version  1 0  encoding  UTF 8     Persons  with the XML input file shown above results in the following XHTML  whitespace has been adjusted here for clarity     xml version  1 0  encoding  UTF 8     Persons Ismincius  Morka Smith  John This XHTML generates the output below when rendered in a web browser   In order for a web browser to be able automatically to apply an XSL transformation to an XML document on display  an XML stylesheet processing instruction can be inserted into XML  So  for example  if the stylesheet in Example 2 above were available as  example2 xsl   the following instruction could be added to the original incoming XML     xml stylesheet href  example2 xsl  type  text xsl      In this example  text xsl is technically incorrect according to the W3C specifications  but it is the only media type that is widely supported across browsers as of 2009   8  See also  XSLT elements   a list of some commonly used XSLT structures
