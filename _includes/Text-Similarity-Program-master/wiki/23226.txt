The Permian is a geologic period and system which extends from to million years ago  It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era  following the Carboniferous Period and preceding the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era  The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison  who named it after the ancient kingdom of Permia   The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals  turtles  lepidosaurs and archosaurs  The world at the time was dominated by a single supercontinent known as Pangaea  surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa  The extensive rainforests of the Carboniferous had disappeared  leaving behind vast regions of arid desert within the continental interior  Amniotes  who could better cope with these drier conditions  rose to dominance in lieu of their amphibian ancestors  The Permian Period  along with the Paleozoic Era  ended with the largest mass extinction in Earth s history  in which nearly 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out  It would take well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe Recovery from the Permian Triassic extinction event was protracted  on land  ecosystems took 30M years to recover   1  Discovery  The term  Permian  was introduced into geology in 1841 by Sir R  I  Murchison  president of the Geological Society of London  who identified typical strata in extensive Russian explorations undertaken with Edouard de Verneuil  Murchison asserted in 1841 that he named his  Permian system  after the ancient kingdom of Permia  and not after the then town of Perm  as usually assumed  The region now lies in the Perm Krai of Russia   2  ICS Subdivisions  Official Subdivisions of the Permian System  from most recent to most ancient rock layers are    Upper Permian  Late Permian  or Lopingian  Tatarian  or Zechstein  epoch  260 4 ± 0 7 Mya   251 0 ± 0 4 Mya     Middle Permian  or Guadalupian epoch  270 6 ± 0 7   260 4 ± 0 7 Mya     Lower   Early Permian or Cisuralian epoch  299 0 ± 0 8   270 6 ± 0 7 Mya    3  Oceans  Sea levels in the Permian remained generally low  and near shore environments were limited by the collection of almost all major landmasses into a single continent    Pangaea  This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species at the end of the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms   4  Paleogeography  During the Permian  all the Earth s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea  Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles  with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean   Panthalassa   the  universal sea    and the Paleo Tethys Ocean  a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana  The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia  causing the Paleo Tethys to shrink  A new ocean was growing on its southern end  the Tethys Ocean  an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era  Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold   continental climate   and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns  Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea  Such dry conditions favored gymnosperms  plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover  over plants such as ferns that disperse spores  The first modern trees  conifers  ginkgos and cycads  appeared in the Permian   Three general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits   the Ural Mountains  where Perm itself is located   China  and the southwest of North America  where the Permian Basin in the U S  state of Texas is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world   5  Climate  The climate in the Permian was quite varied  At the start of the Permian  the Earth was still in an Ice Age  which began in the Carboniferous  Glaciers receded around the mid Permian period as the climate gradually warmed  drying the continent s interiors  In the late Permian period  the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles   6  Life  6 1  Marine biota  Permian marine deposits are rich in fossil mollusks  echinoderms  and brachiopods  Fossilized shells of two kinds of invertebrates are widely used to identify Permian strata and correlate them between sites  fusulinids  a kind of shelled amoeba like protist that is one of the foraminiferans  and ammonoids  shelled cephalopods that are distant relatives of the modern nautilus  By the close of the Permian  trilobites and a host of other marine groups became extinct   6 2  Terrestrial biota  Terrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants  fungi  arthropods  and various types of tetrapods  The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of the Pangaea  The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere  where extensive dry desert appeared  The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides  the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover  A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements   The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing  About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began  The swamp loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous  such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria  were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced seed ferns and early conifers  At the close of the Permian  lycopod and equicete swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora were relegated to a series of equatorial islands in the Paleotethys Sea that later would become South China   The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups  including the ancestors of many present day families  Rich forests were present in many areas  with a diverse mix of plant groups  The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the Glossopteris flora  Oxygen levels were probably high there  The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period   6 3  Insects  From the Pennsylvanian Subperiod of the Carboniferous period until well into the Permian  the most successful Insects were primitive relatives of cockroaches  Six fast legs  four well developed folding wings  fairly good eyes  long  well developed antennae  olfactory   an omnivorous digestive system  a receptacle for storing sperm  a chitin based exoskeleton that could support and protect  as well as a form of gizzard and efficient mouth parts  gave it formidable advantages over other herbivorous animals  About 90% of insects at the start of the Permian were cockroach like insects   Blattopterans     Primitive forms of dragonflies  Odonata  were the dominant aerial predators and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well  True Odonata appeared in the Permian and all are effectively semi aquatic insects  aquatic immature stages  and terrestrial adults   as are all modern odonates  Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils  go back to the Devonian  and are different in several respects from the wings of other insects  Fossils suggest they may have possessed many modern attributes even by the late Carboniferous  and it is possible that they captured small vertebrates  for at least one species had a wing span of   Several other insect groups appeared during the Permian  including the Coleoptera  beetles  and Hemiptera  true bugs    6 4  Synapsid and amphibian fauna  Early Permian terrestrial faunas were dominated by pelycosaurs  diadectes and amphibians  the middle Permian by primitive therapsids such as the dinocephalia  and the late Permian by more advanced therapsids such as gorgonopsians and dicynodonts  Towards the very end of the Permian the first archosaurs appeared  a group that would give rise to the crurotarsans and the dinosaurs in the following period  Also appearing at the end of the Permian were the first cynodonts  which would go on to evolve into mammals during the Triassic  Another group of therapsids  the therocephalians  such as Lycosuchus   arose in the Middle Permian  There were no aerial vertebrates  with the exception of gliding lizards  the avicephalans    The Permian period saw the development of a fully terrestrial fauna and the appearance of the first large herbivores and carnivores  It was the high tide of the anapsids in the form of the massive Pareiasaurs and host of smaller  generally lizard like groups  A group of small reptiles  the diapsids started to abound  These were the ancestors to most modern reptiles and the ruling dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs and crocodiles   Thriving also  were the early ancestors to mammals  the synapsida  which included some large members such as Dimetrodon  Reptiles grew to dominance among vertebrates  because their special adaptations enabled them to flourish in the drier climate   Permian amphibians consisted of temnospondyli  lepospondyli and batrachosaurs   File EdaphosaurusDB jpg Edaphosaurus

extinction event recorded in paleontology  the Permian Triassic extinction event  90% to 95% of marine species became extinct  as well as 70% of all land organisms  It is also the only known mass extinction of insects  Recovery from the Permian Triassic extinction event was protracted  on land  ecosystems took 30M years to recover  Trilobites  which had thrived since Cambrian times  finally became extinct before the end of the Permian  Nautiluses  a species of cephalopods  surprisingly survived this occurrence   There is also significant evidence that massive flood basalt eruptions from magma output lasting thousands of years in what is now the Siberian Traps contributed to environmental stress leading to mass extinction  The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed  Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period  the worst case scenario is an expulsion of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius   Another hypothesis involves ocean venting of hydrogen sulfide gas  Portions of the deep ocean will periodically lose all of their dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas  If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone  the gas can rise into the atmosphere  Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas  but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available to change it  Hydrogen sulfide levels would increase dramatically over a few hundred years  Modeling of such an event indicates that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas  Of course  there are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide   Another hypothesis builds on the flood basalt eruption theory  Five degrees Celsius would not be enough increase in world temperatures to explain the death of 95% of life  But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted  expelling enough methane  among the most potent greenhouse gases  into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius  The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon 12 levels midway into the Permian Triassic boundary layer  It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer s extinctions was land based  the second was marine based  and starting right after the increase in C 12 levels   and the third land based again   An even more speculative hypothesis is that intense radiation from a nearby supernova was responsible for the extinctions   In 2006  a group of American scientists from The Ohio State University reported evidence for a possible huge meteorite crater  Wilkes Land crater  with a diameter of around 500 kilometers in Antarctica  The crater is located at a depth of 1 6 kilometers beneath the ice of Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica  The scientists speculate that this impact may have caused the Permian–Triassic extinction event  although its age is bracketed only between 100 million and 500 million years ago  They also speculate that it may have contributed in some way to the separation of Australia from the Antarctic landmass  which were both part of a supercontinent called Gondwana  Levels of iridium and quartz fracturing in the Permian Triassic layer do not approach those of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer  Given that a far greater proportion of species and individual organisms became extinct during the former  doubt is cast on the significance of a meteor impact in creating the latter  Further doubt has been cast on this theory based on fossils in Greenland showing the extinction to have been gradual  lasting about eighty thousand years  with three distinct phases   Many scientists argue that the Permian Triassic extinction event was caused by a combination of some or all of the hypotheses above and other factors  the formation of Pangaea decreased the number of coastal habitats and may have contributed to the extinction of many clades   8  See also  List of fossil sites  with link directory   Olson s Extinction  Permian tetrapods  9  References  10  Further reading  Ogg  Jim  June  2004  Overview of Global
