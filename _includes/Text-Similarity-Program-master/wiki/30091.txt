The politics of the Republic of China takes place in a framework of a representative democratic republic  whereby the President is head of state and the Premier  President of the Executive Yuan  is head of government  and of a dominant party system  Executive power is exercised by the government  Legislative power is vested in primarily with the parliament and limited by government  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  The party system is dominated by the Kuomintang  KMT   Chinese Nationalist Party   which favors closer links to mainland China   The ROC currently has jurisdiction over Taiwan  Formosa   Penghu  the Pescadores   Kinmen  Quemoy   Matsu and several smaller islands  Taiwan s six major cities  Kaohsiung  New Taipei  Taichung  Tainan  Taipei  and Taoyuan  are special municipalities  The rest of the territories are divided into 3 cities and 13 counties   1  Overview  The ROC is governed under the Constitution of the Republic of China which was drafted in 1947 before the fall of the Chinese mainland to communism and outlined a government for all of China  Significant amendments were made to the Constitution in 1991  and there have been a number of judicial interpretations made to take into account the fact that the Constitution covers a much smaller area than originally envisioned   The government in Taipei officially asserts to be the sole legitimate government of all of China  which it defined as including Taiwan  mainland China  and outer Mongolia  In keeping with that claim  when the KMT fled to Taipei in 1949  they re established the full array of central political bodies  which had existed in mainland China in the de jure capital of Nanjing  Nanking   While much of this structure remains in place  the President Lee Teng hui in 1991 unofficially abandoned the government s claim of sovereignty over mainland China  stating that they do not  dispute the fact that the Communists control mainland China   However  the National Assembly has not officially changed the national borders  as doing so may be seen as a prelude to formal Taiwan independence  the People s Republic of China has threatened to start a war if the government of Taiwan formalizes independence   It should be noted that neither the National Assembly nor the Supreme Court has actually defined what the term  existing national boundaries   as stated in the constitution  actually means  The latter refused to do so claiming that it is a  major political issue    2  Political history  2 1  Republican China  1911–1949  The original founding of the Republic centered on the Three Principles of the People    nationalism  democracy  and people s livelihood  Nationalism meant the Han Chinese race standing up against Manchu rule and Japanese and Western interference  democracy meant elected rule modeled after Japan s parliament  and people s livelihood or socialism  meant government regulation of the means of production  Another lesser known principle that the Republic was founded upon was five races under one union   五族共和   which emphasized the harmony of the five major ethnic groups in China as represented by the colored stripes of the original Five Colored Flag of the Republic  However  this five races under one union principle and the corresponding flag were abandoned in 1927   In reality these three principles were left unrealized  Republican China was marked by warlordism  foreign invasion  and civil war  Although there were elected legislators  from its inception  it was actually a largely one party dictatorship apart from some minor parties  including the   the National Socialist Party and the Rural Construction Party  with suppression of dissent within the KMT of communists  As the central government was quite weak  little could be done in terms of land reform or redistribution of wealth either  Politics of this era consisted primarily of the political and military struggle between the KMT and the Communist Party of China  CPC  in between bouts of active resistance against Japanese invasion   2 2  Political structure  The first national government of the Chinese Republic was established on 1 January 1912  in Nanjing  with Sun Yat sen as the provisional president  Provincial delegates were sent to confirm the authority of the national government  and they later also formed the first parliament  The power of this national government was both limited and short lived  with generals controlling all of central and northern China  The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives   Shortly after the rise of Yuan Shikai  the parliament s authority became nominal  violations of the Constitution by Yuan were met with half hearted motions of censure  and KMT members of the parliament that gave up their membership to the KMT were offered 1 000 pounds  Yuan maintained power locally by sending military generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power  Foreign powers came to recognize Yuan s power as well  when Japan came to China with Twenty One Demands  it was Yuan that submitted to them  on 25 May 1915   After the death of Yuan in 1916  the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government  However  the real power of the time passed to military leaders  forming the warlord period  Still  the powerless government had its use—when World War I began  several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on Germany  in order to liquidate the latter s holdings there   From the beginning to the end of Republican China  political power was generally exercised through both legal and non legal means  Yuan ruled as a dictator  remolding the constitution as he saw fit  warlords withdrew from the Republic  ruling through military control  and Chiang based his political power on military power  During this time  Chiang ruled more as a dictator than as a leader of a one party state  He used white terror tactics and various military campaigns to destroy the CPC  and the police and military apparatus were freely used to attack dissenters  However  Chiang s influence never extended beyond the Yangtze Delta  and the rest of the country was under the effective control of former warlords  and Chiang faced insurrections from them throughout the 1930s  even after the Northern Expedition  which had nominally unified the country  Regional political power remained strong throughout Republican China  and central authority deteriorated continuously until the Second Sino Japanese War  to the point that Chiang became no more than the  head of a loose coalition   as observed by Albert Wedemeyer   2 3  Republic of China on Taiwan since 1949  After the death of Chiang Kai shek  蔣中正  in 1975  Vice President Yen Chia kan  嚴家淦  briefly took over from 1975 to 1978  according to the Constitution  but the actual power was in the hands of the Premier of the Executive Yuan  行政院   Chiang Ching kuo  蔣經國   who was KMT chairman and a son of Chang Kai shek  During the presidency of Chiang Ching kuo from 1978 to 1988  Taiwan s political system began to undergo gradual liberalization   After the lifting of martial law  the opposition Democratic Progressive Party  民主進步黨  was formed and allowed to participate overtly in politics  After Chiang Ching kuo died in 1988  Vice President Lee Teng hui  李登輝  succeeded him as the first Taiwan born president and chairman of the KMT  Lee became the first Taiwan president elected by popular vote in 1996  despite China s missile tests   In 2000  Chen Shui bian  陳水扁  of the pro independence Democratic Progressive Party  DPP  was elected president  marking the first peaceful democratic transition of power to an opposition party in Taiwan history and a decisive end to the KMT s monopoly in administration of the central government   In the 2004 presidential election  the day after being shot while campaigning  Chen was reelected by a narrow margin of 0 2%  The KMT filed lawsuits to demand a recount  alleged voting fraud and staged huge rallies to demand a new election  The courts ruled that the election was accurate and valid   In both of Chen s terms  the DPP and the independence leaning Pan Green Coalition failed to secure a majority in the legislature  losing to the KMT and the pro unification leaning Pan Blue Coalition  This has led to many impasses  the president in the ROC system does not have the power of veto  so the legislature does not feel the need to negotiate with the executive branch   3  Political status and the major camps  One key issue has been the political status of Taiwan itself  With the diplomatic isolation brought about in the 1970s and 1980s  the notion of  recovering the mainland  by force has been dropped and the Taiwanese localization movement strengthened  The relationship with the People s Republic of China and the related issues of Taiwan independence and Chinese reunification continue to dominate Taiwanese politics   The political scene in the ROC is divided into two camps  with the pro unification KMT  People First Party  PFP   and New Party forming the Pan Blue Coalition  and the pro independence Democratic Progressive Party  DPP  and strongly pro independence Taiwan Solidarity Union  TSU  forming the Pan Green Coalition  Because of the dominance of the reunification independence issue in Taiwan s political scene  it is difficult to categorise either camp as  right  or  left  on the conventional basis of economic or social policies   Supporters of the Pan Green camp tend to favor emphasizing the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People s Republic of China  Many Pan Green supporters seek formal Taiwan independence and for dropping the title of the Republic of China  However  more progressive members of the coalition  such as former President Chen Shui bian  have moderated their views and claim that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because Taiwan is already  an independent  sovereign country  and that the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan  Some members take a much more extreme view about Taiwan s status  claiming that the ROC is nonexistent and calling for the establishment of an independent  Republic of Taiwan   Supporters of this idea have even gone as far as issuing self made  passports  for their republic  Attempts to use these  passports  however  have been stopped by officials at Chang Kai shek International Airport   While the Pan Green camp favors Taiwan having an identity separate from that of China  some Pan Blue members  especially former leaders from the older generation  seem to be strongly supportive of the concept of the Republic of China  which remains an important symbol of their links with China  During his visit to mainland China in April 2005  former KMT Party Chairman Lien Chan reiterated his party s belief in the  One China  policy that states that there is only one China controlled by two governments and that Taiwan is a part of China  PFP Party Chair James Soong expressed the same sentiments during his visit in May  In contrast to the positions of these two leaders of the older generation  the more mainstream Pan Blue position is to pursue negotiations with the PRC to immediately open direct transportation links with China and to lift investment restrictions  With regards to independence  the mainstream Pan Blue position is to simply maintain the ROC s current state  and being open to negotiations for unification after China is democratized enough to respect human rights   For its part  the PRC has indicated that it finds a Republic of China far more acceptable than an independent Taiwan  Ironically  although it views the ROC as an illegitimate entity  it has stated that any effort on Taiwan to formally abolish the ROC or formally renounce its claim over mainland China would result in a strong and possibly military reaction  However  the defense of Taiwan by the US and Japan is likely  so it is not  in reality  clear what the PRC reaction would be  The US s current position is that the Taiwan issue must be resolved peacefully and that it condemns unilateral action by either side  an unprovoked invasion by China or a declaration of formal independence by Taiwan   4  Current political issues  The dominant political issue today in the Taiwan Area in the Republic of China  ROC  is its relationship with the Government of the People’s Republic of China  PRC  that has jurisdiction over Mainland China  Specifically  many people in Taiwan desire the opening of direct transportation links with mainland China  including direct flights  which would aid many Taiwanese businesses that have opened factories or branches in mainland China  The former DPP administration feared that such links will lead to tighter economic and thus political integration with the PRC  and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech  Chen Shui bian called for managed opening of links   Mainland China and Taiwan resumed regular direct flights or cross Strait relations on 4 July 2008  after six decades  as a  new start  in their tense relations  Liu Shaoyong  chair of China Southern Airlines  piloted the first flight from Guangzhou to Taipei  Taoyuan International Airport   Simultaneously  a Taiwan based China Airlines flight flew to Shanghai  Five mainland Chinese cities will be connected with eight Taiwan airports  with 4 days a week  36 round trip flights across the Taiwan Strait  thereby eliminating time consuming Hong Kong stopovers  Other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the United States authorized in 2001  In 2008  however  the United States were reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder the recent improvement of ties between China and Taiwan  Another major political issue  is the establishment of a National Communications Commission to take over from the Government Information Office  whose advertising budget exercised great control over the media   Banking reform  including consumer finance  limiting rates on credit cards  and bank mergers  is also a major issue  Taiwan s financial sector is quite unwieldy  with over 48 banks  none of which have a market share over 10%  In addition  the government controls 50% to 60% of Taiwan s banking assets  The ultimate aim is the creation of large financial institutions that will then have the ability to compete internationally   The politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues  Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed  In early 2006  President Chen Shui bian was linked to possible corruption  The political effect on President Chen Shui bian was great  causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike  It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex DPP leader Shih Ming teh which believes the president should resign  The KMT assets continue to be another major issue  as it was once the richest political party in the world  Nearing the end of 2006  KMT s chairman Ma Ying jeou was also hit by corruption controversies  although he has since then been cleared of any wrong doings by the courts  Since completing his second term as President  Chen Shui bian has been charged with corruption and money laundering   The merger of the KMT and People First Party  PFP  was thought to be certain  but a string of defections from the PFP to the KMT have increased tensions within the Pan Blue camp   In 2006  due to the Pacific Sogo Department Store scandal  the pro KMT Pan Blue Coalition moved to impeach the President but failed to obtain the requisite number of votes in the legislature  This failure led to a  Down Ah Bian  campaign  which sought to pressure the president to resign from office  The campaign began on 1 September 2006  Campaign organizers claimed that the first day of the strike attracted 300 000 people in Taipei  while the police estimated the number to be closer to 90 000  The  Down Ah Bian  event was being led by activist and politician Shih Ming te  施明德  as a peaceful sit in around the capital  besieging the presidential residence  While the protests have been largely peaceful  there have been isolated incidences of violence associated with the campaign  including fist fights between Pan Blue and Pan Green  pro DPP  legislatures  The  Up Ah Bian  event was organized to counteract the  Down Ah Bian  campaign  On 13 October 2006  the Pan Blue Coalition attempted again to pass a recall motion against the ROC President Chen Shui bian  which also failed to garner sufficient votes in the legislature   On 3 November 2006  prosecutors in Taiwan stated that they have enough evidence to indict Chen s wife on corruption charges in connection with her handling of a secret diplomatic fund  According to the prosecutors  while Chen would not be indicted while in office  there is a possibility that he would be indicted after he leaves office   In February 2007  Mr  Chen Shui bian said that Taiwan will have to upgrade its weaponry to maintain the military balance with mainland China  He believes that Taiwan s advantage is slipping against mainland China s rising military prowess   5  National identity  Roughly 84% of Taiwan s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from mainland China between 1661 and 1895  Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the 1940s and 1950s  But between 1895 and the present  Taiwan and mainland China have shared a common government for only 4 years  The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation  some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences  as well as hostility between the rival Taiwan and China have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones  Since democratization and the lifting of martial law  a distinct Taiwanese identity  as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity  is often at the heart of political debates  Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China  and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for de jure Taiwan independence  The pan green camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity  while the pan blue camp supports a Chinese identity only  The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity   According to a survey conducted in March 2009  49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese only  and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese  3% consider themselves as only Chinese  Another survey  conducted in Taiwan in July 2009  showed that 82 8% of respondents consider that Taiwan and China are two separate countries developing each on its own  A recent survey conducted in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese only  and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese  8% consider themselves as only Chinese  The survey also shows that among 18–29 year old respondents  75% consider themselves as Taiwanese only   6  Government  6 1  Presidency  The President is the head of state of the Republic of China and commander in chief of the armed forces  The president has authority over the five administrative branches  Yuan   Executive  Legislative  Control  Judicial  and Examination   6 2  National Assembly  The National Assembly of the Republic of China was elected in mainland China in 1947 to officially carry out the duties of choosing the president  to amend the constitution  and to exercise the sovereignty of the citizens  but in actuality  the Assembly s role in Taipei seemed to reconfirm the executive powers of President Chang Kai shek  The National Assembly was re established on Taiwan when the government moved  Because it was impossible to hold subsequent elections to represent constituencies in mainland China  representatives elected in 1947 48 held these seats  indefinitely   In June 1990  however  the Council of Grand Justices mandated the retirement  effective December 1991  of all remaining  indefinitely  elected members of the National Assembly  Legislative Yuan  and other bodies   The second National Assembly  elected in 1991  was composed of 325 members  The majority was elected directly  100 were chosen from party slates in proportion to the popular vote  This National Assembly amended the constitution in 1994  paving the way for the direct election of the president and vice president that was held in March  1996  The National Assembly retained the authority to amend the constitution  to recall or to impeach the president or vice president  and to ratify select senior level presidential appointments  In April 2000  the members of the National Assembly voted to permit their terms of office to expire without holding new elections  They also determined that such an election would be called in the event the National Assembly is needed to decide a presidential recall or a constitutional amendment  In recent years  the National Assembly has handed most of its powers to the Legislative Yuan  including the power of impeachment  In 2005  the National Assembly permanently abolished itself by ratifying a constitution amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan   Amending the ROC constitution now requires the approval of three fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan  This quorum requires at least three fourths of all members of the Legislature  After passing by the legislature  the amendment needs ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout   6 3  Executive Yuan  The Executive Yuan comprises the premier  vice premier  and the cabinet members who are responsible for policy and administration  The president appoints the Premier  who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan   6 4  Legislative Yuan  The main lawmaking body  the Legislative Yuan  LY   was originally elected in 1947  The first LY had 773 seats and was viewed as a  rubber stamp  institution  Like the National Assembly  representatives elected in 1947 48 held these seats  indefinitely  until the 1991 ruling  The second LY was elected in 1992  The third LY  elected in 1995  had 157 members serving 3 year terms  The fourth LY  elected in 1998  was expanded to 225 members  The LY has greatly enhanced its standing in relation to the Executive Yuan and has established itself as an important player on the central level  Along with increasing strength and size this body is beginning to reflect the recently liberalized political system  In the 1992 and 1995 elections  the main opposition partythe Democratic Progressive Party  DPP challenged the KMT dominance of the Legislature  In both elections the DPP won a significant share of the LY seats  and the KMT held only half the seats in the LY  In 1998  however  the KMT increased its LY majority from 50% to 55% and continued to play a dominant role in the legislature as the leading opposition party  In the 2001 election  the DPP became the largest party after large losses suffered by the KMT   6 5  Judicial Yuan  The Judicial Yuan  JY  administers the ROC s court system  It includes a 16 member Council of Grand Justices  COGJ  that interprets the constitution  Grand Justices are appointed by the President  with the consent of the Legislative Yuan  to 9 year terms  The current President of the Judicial Yuan is Rai Hau min   6 6  Control Yuan  The Control Yuan  CY  monitors the efficiency of public service and investigates instances of corruption  The 29 Control Yuan members are appointed by the president and approved by the Legislative Yuan  they serve 6 year terms  In recent years  the Control Yuan has become more active  and it has conducted several major investigations and impeachments  The current president of the Control Yuan is Wang Chien shien   6 7  Examination Yuan  The Examination Yuan  ExY  functions as a civil service commission and includes two ministries  the Ministry of Examination  which recruits officials through competitive examination  and the Ministry of Personnel  which manages the civil service  The President appoints the Examination Yuan s President  The current President of the Examination Yuan is John Kuan   7  Political parties and elections  1  The results of the election have been released by the Central Election Commission of the Republic of China  pdf  2  This is the first legislative election in the Republic of China in which voters cast separate ballots for constituency and party list candidates  In past elections  voters cast only a constituency ballot  and party list allocation was determined by the total constituency votes that each party received  Due to limited comparability between this election and past elections  an increase   decrease comparison is made here for  constituency votes received in 2004 vs 2008 and percentage of total seats in outgoing legislature vs incoming legislature in 2008  3  In a pre election agreement  the Kuomintang and the People First Party agreed to register most PFP constituency candidates as KMT candidates  and nominate a common KMT party list  in order to prevent splitting of the Pan Blue vote  The PFP won one aboriginal seat it contested under its own name  five constituency seats contested under the KMT banner  and three seats within the KMT party list  4  Under New Party direction  all New Party legislators in the outgoing legislature had joined the KMT  and New Party members ran as KMT candidates with New Party endorsement in this election  The New Party ran only party list candidates in this election but failed to pass the 5% threshold  5  The NPSU is formally neither part of the Pan Blue or Pan Green coalition  but its members tend to ally themselves with the pan Blue coalition  and were endorsed by the KMT in this election  6  Chen Fu hai of Kinmen  Quemoy   the lone independent elected in this election  is a former KMT member and endorsed the KMT presidential campaign  Hence the strength of the Pan Blue coalition is taken as 86   see   The outgoing independent is Li Ao  who while refusing ally with either coalition  usually voted with pan Blue  7  Total ballots cast  The turnout was 58 28% for the party list ballots and 58 5% for the constituency ballots  In addition to the parties above  the following minor parties did not contest party list seats and did not win constituency seats  Dadao Compassion Jishih Party  Democratic Freedom Party  Hongyun Jhongyi Party  World Peace Party   In May 2005  a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms  These reforms have been passed  the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot   As of July 2014  there are 254 officially registered parties in the Republic of China  Other parties than the parties listed above include   Taiwan Number One Party  New Nation Association  Democratic Alliance  Natural Law Party  Taiwan Independence Party  Green Party Taiwan  Non Party Alliance  Farmers  Party  Chinese Liberal Democratic Party  Labor Party  Third Society Party The aftermath of the 2000 Presidential election and the 2001 legislative election left the ROC fragmented among several political parties  These parties can be divided into  blue  factions  Pan Blue Coalition  and  green  factions  Pan Green Coalition   with the  blue  faction tending toward unification and a national identity that is linked with China and the  green  faction leaning toward a national identity based on Taiwan independence which is separate from the Chinese national identity  The complex structure of the party system in the ROC was also influenced by the voting system which uses single non transferable vote for legislative elections and first past the post for executive elections  Starting with the 2008 legislative elections  the SNTV system was discarded in favor of a mixed single member district  SMD  with proportional representation based on national party votes  similar to Japan   The  blue  faction comes from the color of the KMT and includes the KMT  the People First Party  and the New Party  The  green  faction comes from the color of the Democratic Progressive Party and includes the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union     Kuomintang Until 1986  the ROC s political system was effectively controlled by one party  the KMT  the leader of which also was the ROC president  Many top political officials were members of the party  The party claimed over 2 million members  and its net assets were reputed to total more than NT $61 2 billion  making it the richest political party in the world     Democratic Progressive Party After 1986  the KMT s hold on power was challenged by the emergence of competing political parties  Before 1986  candidates opposing the KMT ran in elections as independents or  nonpartisans   Before the 1986 island wide elections many  nonpartisans  grouped together to create Taiwan s first opposition party  the Democratic Progressive Party  DPP   Despite the official ban on forming new political parties  the ROC authorities did not prohibit the DPP from operating  and in the 1986 elections DPP and independent candidates captured more than 20% of the vote   The Civic Organizations Law passed in 1989 allowed for the formation of new political parties  thereby legalizing the DPP  and its support and influence increased  In the 1992 Legislative Yuan elections  the DPP won 51 seats in the 161 seat body  While this was only half the number of KMT seats  it made the DPP s voice an important factor in legislative decisions  Winning the Taipei mayor s position in December 1994  significantly enhanced the DPP s image  The DPP continued its strong showing in the 1995 LY race  winning 45 of the 157 seats to the KMT s 81  The DPP for the first time succeeded in outpolling the KMT in the November 1997 local elections  gaining 12 of the 23 magistrate and mayoral seats as opposed to the KMT s 8 and winning 43% of the vote versus the KMT s 41%   The DPP membership is made up largely of the Hoklo people  the largest ethnic group in Taiwan  The DPP maintains that Taiwan is an entity separate from mainland China and supports an independent  Republic of Taiwan  as part of its platform  The recent downplaying of Taiwan independence by the DPP as a party  however  led to the formation by hard line advocates of a new political party called the Taiwan Independence Party in December 1996     New Party The New Party was formed in August 1993 by a group made up largely of second generation mainlander KMT members who were unhappy both with corruption in the KMT and with what they saw as the  Taiwanization  of KMT ideology and leadership  The NP emphasizes  clean government  and the original KMT focus on unification with mainland China  NP influence remains modest and seems on the wane  it won 21 of the 164 LY seats in the 1995 elections but only 11 of 225 seats in 1998  The New Party was almost annihilated in the 2001 election as its members defected to the Peoples First Party     People s First Party A new opposition party was formed in the wake of the March 2000 presidential election by the runner up  a KMT maverick candidate  The People s First Party is composed primarily of former KMT and NP members who supported former KMT Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong s presidential bid  The PFP currently had 17 members in the LY before the 2001 election  but increased its representation to over 40 in that election     Taiwan Solidarity Union In 2001  supporters of former President Lee founded the Taiwanese Solidarity Union  TSU   Even though Lee did not join this party  he is named its spiritual leader and most believe he endorsed it  The TSU was formed primarily because  as it took power  the DPP had to moderate its standing as regards to Taiwan independence  leaving a hole in the Taiwanese political spectrum  In a bid to help the  green  side achieve control in the Legislative Yuan  the TSU was formed to attract the radical votes left over from DPP and the localist support for KMT  The TSU had often expressed that it wanted to be the  decisive minority    Although some friction between mainlanders and native Taiwanese still exists  it has abated with time  and there has been a gradual melding of the two communities  In 1972  then Premier Chiang Ching kuo began a concentrated effort to bring Taiwanese into more senior position in the central administration and the KMT  Upon his accession to the presidency in January 1988  Lee Teng hui  who is a native Taiwanese  continued this process  Steps by the government to redress past wrongs such as setting up a memorial to the victims of the February 28 Incident have contributed to this process   8  Political conditions  This change in the political process is the result of the liberalizing trend that began in the 1980s under President Chiang Ching kuo  In 1987  he lifted the emergency decree  which had been in place since 1948 and which had granted virtually unlimited powers to the president for use in the anti communist campaign  This decree provided the basis for nearly four decades of martial law under which individuals and groups expressing dissenting views were dealt with harshly  Expressing views contrary to the authorities  claim to represent all of China or supporting independent Taiwan independence was treated as sedition  Vice President Lee Teng hui succeeded Chiang Ching kuo as president when Chiang died on 13 January 1988  Lee was elected by the National Assembly to a 6 year term in 1990  marking the final time a president was elected by the National Assembly   Since ending martial law  the Republic of China has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic political system  Most restrictions on the press have ended  restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed  and the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been lifted   As the National Assembly took action in 1994 to allow for the popular election of the president  the LY in 1994 passed legislation to allow for the direct election of the governor of Taiwan Province and the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung Municipalities  These elections were held in December 1994  with the KMT winning the governor and Kaohsiung mayor posts  and the DPP winning the Taipei mayor s position  In March 1996  Lee Teng hui was elected president and Lien Chan vice president in the first direct election by Taiwan s voters  In 1998  the KMT s Ma Ying jeou wrestled back control of the mayorship of Taipei from the opposition DPP s most prominent figure Chen Shui bian  In the same elections  however  the DPP s Frank Hsieh managed to defeat Kaoshiung s KMT incumbent   The position of elected governor and many other elements of the Taiwan Provincial Government were eliminated at the end of 1998  The stated purpose of this was to streamline administrative efficiency  but some commentators have argued that this was also intended to weaken the power base of Governor James Soong  In November 1997 local elections  the DPP won 12 of the 23 county magistrate and city mayor contests to the KMT s 8  outpolling the KMT for the first time in a major election   In March 2000  Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui bian became the first opposition party candidate to win the presidency  His victory resulted in the first ever transition of the presidential office from one political party to another in the ROC  The election also had the effect of splitting the KMT s support base  James Soong launched an independent bid for the presidency after failing to be nominated by the party  In response the KMT expelled Soong and his supporters  Soong and his supporters blamed then KMT Chairman Lee Teng hui of harboring pro independence sentiments and purposely trying to aid Chen Shui bian by splitting the KMT s vote by running the less charismatic Lien Chan along with Soong  After losing the vote narrowly to Chen and ahead of Lien  Soong established the People First Party  Lee Teng hui was soon forced out of the KMT Chairmanship amid popular protests and riots demanding he take responsibility for the KMT s defeat   In the months following the 2000 presidential election  Lee Teng hui s supporters established the Taiwan Solidarity Union  which advocated a more radical brand of Taiwan independence than the DPP  For this  Lee was expelled from the KMT and the KMT gradually moved itself to a more conservative and pro reunificationist position  This permitted the formation of two rival coalitions that have since dominated Taiwanese politics  the Pan Blue Coalition formed by the KMT  People First Party  and New Party and the Pan Green Coalition formed by the Democratic Progressive Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union   In the 2001 LY elections  the DPP won a plurality of seats for the first time  However  the Pan Blue Coalition held a small majority over the Pan Green Coalition  causing much of President Chen s agenda to be derailed  This also gave independents in the legislature more power  some of whom founded the Non Partisan Solidarity Union in 2004   In a hotly contested election on 20 March 2004  President Chen Shui bian was re elected by 50 1% of the popular vote to a second term  The election was marred by a shooting incident the day before the election during which President Chen and his running mate Vice President Annette Lu were slightly wounded  While the opposition contested the results and suggested the shooting was staged to win sympathy  as President Chen had previously been slated to lose narrowly   it was the first time that the DPP has won an outright majority in an island wide election   The March election also included a  peace referendum   Historically  the issue of referendums has been closely tied to the question of Taiwan independence  and thus has been a sensitive issue in cross Strait relations  There were two referendums before the voters on 20 March 2004  The first asked in light of the PRC missile threat whether the ROC should purchase anti missile systems  The second asked whether Taiwan should adopt a  peace framework  for addressing cross Strait differences with the PRC  However both referendums failed to obtain support from over 50% of registered voters  as required to be valid  The Pan Blue Coalition campaigned against the referendum as unnecessary and urged voters to boycott it   President Chen Shui bian has called for major constitutional reforms by 2006 aimed at further reducing layers of government  and making other structural changes aimed at improving governance  The People s Republic of China has accused Chen of using the constitution issue to move Taiwan towards independence  He expressed opposition  however  in his 20 May 2004 inaugural address to using constitutional reform to alter the constitution s definition of Taiwan sovereignty   The Legislative Yuan passed a set of constitutional amendments on 23 August 2004 that halve the number of LY seats and create single member districts  The revisions also eliminate the role of the National Assembly and permit the public to confirm or reject future revisions passed by the LY  These constitutional amendments were ratified by the National Assembly in 2005   Prior to the 11 December 2004 elections to the Legislative Yuan  signs indicated that the DPP would for the first time dominate the Legislative Yuan  Polls projected a huge pan green victory  and the DPP s election tactics were based on them  This over reliance on polls resulted in a huge setback  The pan blue opposition managed to maintain their majority status within the Legislative Yuan  winning 114 seats out of the 225 seats  The Pan Green only managed to win 101 seats  The remaining 10 seats were won by the independent candidates  Although the Pan Green coalition increased their seats by one and the DPP remained the largest party  because of raised hopes the election was viewed as a disaster  and President Chen resigned his post as Chairman of DPP as a result   On 3 December 2005  the KMT made major gains in municipal elections  taking 14 of 23 mayor or county magistrate seats  while the DPP retained only six seats of their previous 10  The pan blue People First Party and New Party each took one seat  and an independent won one seat  The pan green TSU was completely shut out  DPP chairman Su Tseng chang had promised to resign to take responsibility for the defeat  This dramatic setback for the DPP and pan greens was seen as a reaction to recent corruption scandals  and public disapproval of Chen Shui Bian s apparent refusal to improve cross strait relations   A  M  Rosenthal  former executive editor of The New York Times accused China of fostering an  apartheid  policy toward Taiwan  Dr Tan Sun Chen  Taiwan s Minister of Foreign Affairs  asserts that China s obstruction in the international community has led to a  political apartheid  which  harms the human rights  interests  and dignity of Taiwan’s people     9  ROC and PRC  Despite the differences between Taiwan and mainland China  contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has grown significantly over the past decade  The ROC has continued to relax restrictions on unofficial contacts with the PRC  and cross Strait interaction has mushroomed  Since 1987  when the ban on travel to mainland China was lifted  Taiwan residents have made more than 10 million trips to mainland China  The ROC Bureau of Foreign Trade estimates that indirect trade with mainland China reached about US$61 639 billion  or 18% of the total trade of the ROC  in 2004  This indirect trade runs heavily in Taiwan s favor  providing another outlet for the island s booming economy  In an attempt to facilitate trade  in 1995 the Executive Yuan approved the construction of an offshore transshipment center at the port of Kaohsiung through which direct shipping with the mainland China would be permitted  In April 1997 the first sanctioned direct cross Strait shipping began between selected mainland China ports and Kaohsiung for cargo being transshipped through Taiwan   Beijing has expressed a mixed view of these developments  PRC leaders are pleased at the development of economic ties and exchanges  which they believe helps their cause of reunification  However  the increase in contacts  combined with domestic political liberalization on Taiwan  also has resulted in more open discussion in Taiwan of the future of Taiwan  including the option of independence  to which Beijing is strongly opposed   The trend in cross Strait interaction is one of steady growth with  so far  only temporary setbacks due to political factors such as the PRC s reaction Lee Teng hui s private visit to the U S  in 1995 and the PRC s reaction his 1999 characterization of relations with mainland China as  state to state   Taiwan business representatives have concerns about issues such as safety  corruption  and contract disputes  which have led to increased caution and a search for alternative investment venues but not to pulling out from mainland China altogether  President Chen has yet to revise the previous administration s  no haste  be patient  policy regarding Taiwan mainland China investment to prevent over dependence on the PRC  As a result of this policy the ROC has placed restrictions on largescale infrastructure investments on mainland China in 1997  Despite this  billions of dollars have been invested in mainland China by smaller firms   The development of semiofficial cross Strait relations has been incremental  Prior to April 1993  when talks were held in Singapore between the heads of two private intermediary organizationsTaiwan s Straits Exchange Foundation  SEF  and the PRC s Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  ARATS there had been some lower level exchanges between the two sides of the Strait  The April 1993 SEF ARATS talks primarily addressed technical issues relating to cross Strait interactions  Lower level talks continued on a fairly regular basis until they were suspended by Beijing in 1995 after President Lee s U S  visit  Unofficial exchanges resumed in 1997 through informal meetings between personnel of the two sides  unofficial representative organizations  Direct SEF ARATS contacts resumed in April 1998  and the SEF Chairman visited mainland China in October 1998  A planned visit by ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan to Taiwan in the fall  however  was postponed following statements made by then President Lee Teng hui that relations between mainland China and Taiwan should be conducted as  state to state  or at least as  special state to state relations   Since his 20 May 2000 inauguration  President Chen has called for resuming the cross Strait dialogue without any preconditions  President Chen has stated that such talks should be conducted on the basis of the  spirit of 1992   a reference to the agreement to hold the 1993 Singapore talks  The PRC  however  has insisted that President Chen must recognize the one China principle before talks can be held   10  Administrative divisions  The Republic of China currently administers the island of Taiwan  Formosa   Penghu  Pescadores   Kinmen
