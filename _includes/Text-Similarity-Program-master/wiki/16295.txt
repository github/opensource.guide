Josiah Wedgwood  12 July 17303 January 1795  was an English potter who founded the Wedgwood company and is credited with the industrialisation of the manufacture of pottery  A prominent abolitionist  Wedgwood is remembered for his  Am I Not a Man And a Brother   anti slavery medallion  He was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family  He was the grandfather of Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin   1  Biography  1 1  Early life  Born in Burslem  Staffordshire  England  the eleventh and last child of Thomas Wedgwood and Mary Wedgwood  née Stringer  d  1766   Josiah was raised within a family of English Dissenters  By the age of nine  he was proving himself to be a skilled potter  He survived a childhood bout of smallpox to serve as an apprentice potter under his eldest brother Thomas Wedgwood IV  Smallpox left Josiah with a permanently weakened knee  which made him unable to work the foot pedal of a potter s wheel  As a result  he concentrated from an early age on designing pottery and then making it   In his early twenties  Wedgwood began working with the most renowned English pottery maker of his day  Thomas Whieldon  who eventually became his business partner in 1754  He began experimenting with a wide variety of techniques  an experimentation that coincided with the burgeoning of the nearby industrial city of Manchester  Inspired  Wedgwood leased the Ivy Works in the town of Burslem  Over the course of the next decade  his experimentation  and a considerable injection of capital from his marriage to a richly endowed distant cousin  transformed the sleepy artisan works into the first true pottery factory   1 2  Marriage and children  Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood  1734–1815   his third cousin  in January 1764  They had eight children   Susannah Wedgwood  mother of the English naturalist Charles Darwin  John Wedgwood  1766–1844   Richard Wedgwood  1767–1768   died as a child   Josiah Wedgwood II  1769–1843   father of Emma Darwin  cousin and wife of the English naturalist Charles Darwin   Thomas Wedgwood  1771–1805   no children   Catherine Wedgwood  1774–1823   no children   Sarah Wedgwood  1776–1856   no children  very active in the slavery abolition movement   Mary Anne Wedgwood  1778–86   died as a child   1 3  Work  Wedgwood was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery  His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market  He was perhaps the most famous potter of all time  By 1763  he was receiving orders from the highest levels of the British nobility  including Queen Charlotte  Wedgwood convinced her to let him name the line of pottery she had purchased  Queen s Ware   and trumpeted the royal association in his paperwork and stationery  In 1773  Catherine the Great of Russia ordered the Green Frog Service from Wedgwood  it can still be seen in the Hermitage Museum  An even earlier commission from Catherine was the Husk Service  1770   now on exhibit in Petergof   As a leading industrialist  Wedgwood was a major backer of the Trent and Mersey Canal dug between the River Trent and River Mersey  during which time he became friends with Erasmus Darwin  Later that decade  his burgeoning business caused him to move from the smaller Ivy Works to the newly built Etruria Works  which would run for 180 years  The factory was so named after the Etruria district of Italy  where black porcelain dating to Etruscan times was being excavated  Wedgwood found this porcelain inspiring  and his first major commercial success was its duplication with what he called  Black Basalt   He combined experiments in his art and in the technique of mass production with an interest in improved roads  canals  schools and living conditions  At Etruria  he even built a village for his workers   Not long after the new works opened  continuing trouble with his smallpox afflicted knee made necessary the amputation of his right leg  In 1780  his long time business partner Thomas Bentley died  and Wedgwood turned to Darwin for help in running the business  As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families  Josiah s eldest daughter would later marry Erasmus  son  One of the children of that marriage  Charles Darwin  would also marry a Wedgwood — Emma  Josiah s granddaughter  This double barreled inheritance of Wedgwood s money gave Charles Darwin the leisure time to formulate his theory of evolution   In the latter part of his life  Wedgwood s obsession was to duplicate the Portland Vase  a blue and white glass vase dating to the first century BC  For three years he worked on the project  eventually producing what he considered a satisfactory copy in 1789  After passing on his company to his sons  Wedgwood died at home  probably of cancer of the jaw  in 1795  He was buried three days later in the parish church of Stoke on Trent  Seven years later a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons was installed there   He belonged to the fourth generation of a family of potters whose traditional occupation continued through another five generations  Wedgwood s company is still a famous name in pottery today  as part of Waterford Wedgwood  see Waterford Crystal   and  Wedgwood China  is sometimes used as a term for his Jasperware  the coloured stoneware with applied relief decoration  usually white   still common throughout the world   He was an active member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham often held at Erasmus Darwin House and is remembered on the Moonstones in Birmingham  He was elected to the Royal Society in 1783 for the development of a pyrometer   Wedgwood is credited as the inventor of modern marketing  specifically direct mail  money back guarantees  travelling salesmen  self service  free delivery  buy one get one free  and illustrated catalogues  Wedgwood is also noted as an early adopter founder of managerial accounting principals in Anthony Hopwood s  Archaeology of Accounting Systems    2   Am I Not a Man And a Brother    Wedgwood was a prominent slavery abolitionist  His friendship with Thomas Clarkson – abolitionist campaigner and the first historian of the British abolition movement – aroused his interest in slavery  Wedgwood mass produced cameos depicting the seal for the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade and had them widely distributed  which thereby became a popular and celebrated image  The Wedgwood medallion was the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th century art  The actual design of the cameo was probably done by either William Hackwood or Henry Webber who were modellers in his Stoke on Trent factory  From 1787 until his death in 1795  Wedgwood actively participated in the abolition of slavery cause  and his Slave Medallion  which brought public attention to abolition  Wedgwood reproduced the design in a cameo with the black figure against a white background and donated hundreds of these to the society for distribution  Thomas Clarkson wrote   ladies wore them in bracelets  and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair  At length the taste for wearing them became general  and thus fashion  which usually confines itself to worthless things  was seen for once in the honorable office of promoting the cause of justice  humanity and freedom    The design on the medallion became popular and was used elsewhere  large scale copies were painted to hang on walls and it was used on clay tobacco pipes   3  Sydney Cove medallion  Commemorating the landing of the First Fleet in Botany Bay  the Sydney Cove medallion was made by Josiah Wedgwood after he was given a sample of clay from Sydney Cove by Sir Joseph Banks  who had received the sample from Governor Arthur Phillip  Wedgwood made it into a commemorative medallion titled  Hope encouraging Art and Labour  under the influence of Peace  to pursue the employments necessary to give security and happiness to an infant settlement    4  Legacy and influence  A locomotive named after Wedgwood ran on the Churnet Valley Railway   A plaque  in Wedgwood s blue pottery style  marking the site of his London showrooms between 1774 and 1795 in Wedgwood Mews  is located at 12  Greek Street  London  W1   5  Inventions  Josiah Wedgwood also invented the pyrometer  a device to measure the extremely high temperatures that are found in kilns during the firing of pottery  For this he was elected a member of the Royal Society   6  See also  Josiah Wedgwood & Sons  Erasmus Darwin House Erasmus Darwin Museum house and gardens  7  Sources  Dolan  Brian  2004   Wedgwood  The First
