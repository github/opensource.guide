Roger Bacon  OFM    c  1214 – June 1292   scholastic accolade Doctor Mirabilis  meaning  wonderful teacher    was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empirical methods  He is sometimes credited  mainly since the nineteenth century  as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by Aristotle and later Arabic scholars such as the Muslim scientist Alhazen  However  more recent re evaluations emphasise that he was essentially a medieval thinker  with much of his  experimental  knowledge obtained from books  in the scholastic tradition  A survey of how Bacon s work was received over the centuries found that it often reflected the concerns and controversies that were central to his readers   Roger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset  England  possibly in 1213 or 1214 at the Ilchester Friary  The only source for his birth date is his statement in the Opus Tertium  written in 1267  that  forty years have passed since I first learned the alphabet   The 1214 birth date assumes he meant exactly 40 years had passed since he matriculated at Oxford at age 13  If he had been literal  it is more likely he was born around 1220 to 1222  but the figure forty was also widely used in the Middle Ages simply as a synonym for many  leaving his actual date of birth in doubt  In the same passage he said that for all but two of the forty years he had been engaged in study  His family appears to have been well off  but during the stormy reign of Henry III of England their property was seized and several family members driven into exile   Bacon studied at Oxford and may have been a disciple of Grosseteste  He became a master at Oxford  lecturing on Aristotle  There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate—the title Doctor Mirabilis was posthumous and figurative  Sometime between 1237 and 1245  he began lecturing at the University of Paris  then the centre of European intellectual life  Where he was between 1247 and 1256 is unknown  but about 1256 he became a friar in the Franciscan Order  and no longer held a teaching post  After 1260  his activities were restricted by a Franciscan statute prohibiting friars from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval   Bacon circumvented this through his acquaintance with Cardinal Guy le Gros de Foulques  who became Pope Clement IV in 1265  Clement IV issued a mandate ordering Bacon to write to him concerning the place of philosophy within theology  Bacon sent the Pope his Opus Majus  which presented his views on how to incorporate the philosophy of Aristotle and science into a new Theology  Bacon also sent his Opus minus  De multiplicatione specierum  and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology   Pope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector  Some time between 1277 and 1279  Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest for his excessive credulity in alchemy and for his harsh regard for the other innovators of his time  Some time after 1278 Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford  where he continued his studies and is presumed to have spent most of the rest of his life  He is said to have died in June of 1292  the year of his last dateable writing  Compendium studii theologiae  and to be buried in Oxford   1  Changing interpretations of Roger Bacon  In the early modern period  Bacon gained a reputation as the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge  a Faust like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven  Of these legends  one of the most prominent was that he created a brazen talking head which could answer any question  The most famous account of Bacon from this point of view is Robert Greene s late sixteenth century Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay   In the nineteenth century it was a widely held interpretation that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist who had emerged before his time  This reflected two prevalent views of the period  an emphasis upon experiment as the principal form of scientific activity and a general acceptance of the characterisation of the Middle Ages as the  Dark Ages   Some writers of the period carried this account further  According to Andrew Dickson White  for instance  Bacon was repeatedly persecuted and imprisoned because of opposition to him by the medieval Church  In this view  which is still reflected in some 21st century popular science books  Bacon would be an advocate of modern experimental science who somehow emerged as an isolated figure in an age supposed to be hostile toward scientific ideas  He was also presented as a visionary  for instance  Frederick Mayer wrote that Bacon predicted the invention of the submarine  automobile  and aircraft   However  in the course of the 20th century  the philosophical understanding of the role of experiment in the sciences was substantially modified  Starting with works of Pierre Duhem  Raoul Carton  and Lynn Thorndike  it is argued that Bacon s advocacy of scientia experimentalis differed from modern experimental science  New historical research has also shown that medieval Christians were not generally opposed to scientific investigation and has revealed the extent and variety of medieval science  In fact  many medieval sources of  and influences on  Bacon s scientific activity have been identified  For instance  Bacon s idea that inductively derived conclusions should be submitted for further experimental testing is very much like Robert Grosseteste s  Method of Verification   and Bacon s work on optics and the calendar also followed the lines of inquiry of Grosseteste   As a result  the picture of Bacon has changed  One recent study summarised that   Bacon was not a modern  out of step with his age  or a harbinger of things to come  but a brilliant  combative  and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century  endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions    of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge   Thus  rather than being isolated  Bacon is now seen as a leading figure in the beginnings of medieval universities at Paris and Oxford  among other contemporary exponents of this shift in the philosophy of science  as we call it today   including Grosseteste  who preceded Bacon   William of Auvergne  Henry of Ghent  Albert Magnus  Thomas Aquinas  John Duns Scotus  and William of Ockham   As to the alleged persecution  the first known reference to an imprisonment originates around eighty years after Bacon s death  It says the order was given by the head of the Franciscans because of unspecified  suspected novelties   However  the fact that no earlier report has been found drives scepticism over the assertion  Moreover  current historians of science who see an incarceration as plausible typically do not connect it with Bacon s scientific writings  Instead  if it happened  scholars speculate that his troubles resulted from such things as his sympathies for radical Franciscans  attraction to contemporary prophecies  or interest in certain astrological doctrines  Bacon s personality has also been mentioned as a factor   A recent review of the many visions that each age has held about Roger Bacon says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought  the commitment to the Franciscan order   His Opus maius was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith  written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars  It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non Christians and of the Antichrist  It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy    2  Works  Bacon s Opus Majus contains treatments of mathematics and optics  alchemy  and the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies   2 1  View of the past  In contrast to Aristotle s argument that facts be collected before deducing scientific truths  physical science was not carried out by observations from the natural world  but by arguments based solely on tradition and prescribed authorities   The mathematicians whom he considered perfect were Peter of Maricourt and John of London  and two were good  Campanus of Novara and a Master Nicholas  Peter was the author of a famous letter to a friend  Epistola de Magnete  in which he described some of the earliest European experiments with magnetism  Campanus wrote several important works on astronomy  astrology  and the calendar  Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste and Adam Marsh  as well as to other lesser figures  He was clearly not an isolated scholar in the thirteenth century   2 2  New approach  In his writings  Bacon calls for a reform of theological study  Less emphasis should be placed on minor philosophical distinctions than had been the case in scholasticism  Instead  the Bible itself should return to the centre of attention and theologians should thoroughly study the languages in which their original sources were composed  He was fluent in several languages and lamented the corruption of the holy texts and the works of the Greek philosophers by numerous mistranslations and misinterpretations  Furthermore  he urged all theologians to study all sciences closely  and to add them to the normal university curriculum  With regard to the obtaining of knowledge  he strongly championed experimental study over reliance on authority  arguing that  thence cometh quiet to the mind   Bacon did not restrict this approach to theological studies  He rejected the blind following of prior authorities  both in theological and scientific study  which was the accepted method of undertaking study in his day   In the Opus Minus he criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus  who  he says  had not studied Aristotelian texts but only acquired their learning during their life as preachers  Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle  Avicenna  and Averroes  leading Bacon to proclaim that  never in the world  had  such monstrosity occurred before    2 3  Optics  The study of optics in part five of Opus Majus draws heavily on the works of both Claudius Ptolemy  his Optics in Arabic translation  and the Islamic scientists Alkindus  al Kindi  and Alhazen  Ibn al Haytham   He includes a discussion of the physiology of eyesight  the anatomy of the eye and the brain  and considers light  distance  position  and size  direct vision  reflected vision  and refraction  mirrors and lenses  His research in optics was primarily oriented by the legacy of Alhazen through a Latin translation of the latter s monumental Kitab al manazir  De aspectibus  Perspectivae  The Optics   while the impact of the tradition of al Kindi  Alkindus  was principally mediated through the influence that this Muslim scholar had on the optics of Robert Grosseteste  Moreover  Bacon s investigations of the properties of the magnifying glass partly rested on the handed down legacy of Islamic opticians  mainly Alhazen  who was in his turn influenced by Ibn Sahl s 10th century legacy in dioptrics   2 4  Calendar  He was a forerunner in Calendar reformation  Drawing on the recently discovered Greco Muslim astronomy and on the calendaric writings of Robert Grosseteste  Bacon criticised the Julian calendar  describing it as intolerable  horrible and laughable   He had correctly deduced that the assumption of Julius Caesar s year of length of 365 days and a quarter was wrong  He proposed to Pope Clement IV in 1267 in his Opus Majus  Part IV  to rectify these errors by dropping a day every 125 years  By not doing this correction  a surplus of time over the centuries had accumulated to nine days during his time  He charged that the then current notion of fixed equinoxes and solstices was also wrong  As this is important in calculating the date of Easter  he was extremely distressed that Christians were celebrating Easter and other holy festivals on the wrong dates  because of this error  Unfortunately  the untimely death of Pope Clement IV in 1268 put an end to his hopes   Bacon s fears were accepted and the calendar corrected only in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII in the Gregorian Calendar reformation   2 5  Other attributed works  In his own writings of 1260–1280 Bacon cited Secretum secretorum  which he attributed to Aristotle  far more than his contemporaries did  Often used as an argument for the special influence that this work had on Bacon s own is the manuscript of Secretum that Bacon edited  complete with his own introduction and notes  something Bacon seldom did with others  works  Although some early 20th century scholars like Robert Steele have pushed further along this path  arguing that Bacon s contact with the Secretum was a turning point in Bacon s philosophy  transforming him into an experimentalist  there is no clear reference to such a decisive impact of the Secretum in Bacon s own words  The dating of Bacon s edition of the Secretum is a key argument in this debate  but is still unresolved  with those arguing for a greater impact dating it earlier than those who urge caution in this interpretation   The cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources  including by its first recorded owner  in a book drafted by William Romaine Newbold and posthumously edited and published by Roland Grubb Kent in 1928  and in a 2005 book of Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone published by Doubleday and Broadway Books  In strongly worded terms  historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton have dismissed these claims as unsupported   Another work of contentious date and even origin is the Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae  et de Nullitate Magiae  meaning Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature  and on the Vanity of Magic   sometimes alternatively entitled De Mirabili Potestate Artis et Naturae  On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature   This treatise dismisses magical practices like necromancy  and contains most of the alchemical work attributed to Bacon  chiefly a formula for philosopher s stone  and perhaps one for gunpowder  It also contains a number of passages about hypothetical flying machines and  what we today call  submarines  attributing their first use to Alexander the Great   Bacon is also the ascribed author of the alchemical manual Speculum Alchemiae  which was translated into English as The Mirror of Alchimy in 1597  It is a short treatise about the composition and origin of metals  espousing  conventional   with respect to the period  Arabian theories of mercury and sulphur as the constituents of metals  and containing vague allusions to transmutation  About this work  John Maxson Stillman wrote that  there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon s style or ideas  nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries   M  M  Pattison Muir had a similar opinion  and Edmund Oscar von Lippmann considered this text a pseudepigraph   2 6  Gunpowder  Bacon is often considered the first European to describe a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder  Based on two passages from Bacon s Opus Majus and Opus Tertium  extensively analysed by J  R  Partington  several scholars cited by Joseph Needham concluded that Bacon had most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers  possibly obtained with the intermediation of other Franciscans  like his friend William of Rubruck  who had visited the Mongols  The most telling passage reads   We have an example of these things  that act on the senses  in  the sound and fire of  that children s toy which is made in many  diverse  parts of the world  i e  a device no bigger than one s thumb  From the violence of that salt called saltpetre  together with sulphur and willow charcoal  combined into a powder  so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small  no more than a bit of parchment  containing it   that we find  the ear assaulted by a noise  exceeding the roar of strong thunder  and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning    More controversial are the claims originating with Royal Artillery colonel Henry William Lovett Hime  at the beginning of the 20th century  that a cryptogram existed in Bacon s Epistola  giving the ratio of ingredients of the mixture  These were published  among other places  in the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica  An early critic of this claim was Lynn Thorndike  starting with a letter in the 1915 edition of the journal Science  and repeated in several books of his  M  M  Pattison Muir also expressed his doubts on Hime s theory  and they were echoed by John Maxson Stillman  Robert Steele and George Sarton also joined the critics  Needham concurred with these earlier critics in their opinion that the additional passage does not originate with Bacon  In any case  the proportions claimed to have been deciphered  7 5 5 saltpetre charcoal sulfur  are not even useful for stuffing firecrackers  burning slowly while producing mostly smoke  and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel  The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties   3  In twentieth century fiction  To commemorate Bacon s seven hundredth anniversary  Professor John Erskine wrote A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century  a biographical play which was produced at Columbia University and published as a book by Columbia University Press in 1914   An accessible description of Roger Bacon s life and times is contained in the fiction book Doctor Mirabilis  written in 1964 by the science fiction author James Blish  This is the second book in Blish s quasi religious trilogy After Such Knowledge  and is a recounting of Bacon s life and struggle to develop a  Universal Science   Though thoroughly researched  with a host of references  including extensive use of Bacon s own writings  frequently in the original Latin  the book is written in the style of a novel  and Blish himself referred to it as  fiction  or  a vision   Blish s view of Bacon is uncompromisingly that he was the first scientist  and he provides a postscript to the novel in which he sets forth these views  Central to his depiction of Roger Bacon is that  He was not an inventor  an Edison or Luther Burbank  holding up a test tube with a shout of Eureka   He was instead a theoretical scientist probing fundamental realities  and his visions of modern technology were just by products of     the way he normally thought – the theory of theories as tools     Blish indicates where Bacon s writings  for example  consider Newtonian metrical frameworks for space  then reject these for something which reads remarkably like Einsteinian Relativity  and all     breathtakingly without pause or hiccup  breezily moving without any recourse through over 800 years of physics    In John Bellairs  The Face in the Frost  Roger Bacon is friend of the main character   In Robertson Davies s novel Fifth Business  1970   where  The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon  answers audience questions as part of Magnus Eisengrim s magic show   Bacon also appears as first scientist in The Black Rose  the most commercially successful book by Thomas Costain  written in 1945  The Black Rose is set in the Middle Ages  Bacon s personal presence in the narrative is brief  but includes a demonstration of gunpowder and a few sentences outlining a philosophy of science which might as easily be attributed to Francis Bacon centuries later  The novel s Roger Bacon serves to motivate Costain s protagonist  a fictional Englishman who journeys to China during the reigns of Edward I and Kublai Khan  Costain s narration includes technology such as the compass  the telescope  rockets and the manufacture of paper  all described by his young adventurer with an eye toward bringing these marvels back to Bacon for analysis  Returning to England to find Bacon gone and under house arrest  the traveller begs King Edward to intercede with the pope for the Franciscan s release  arguing that with Bacon s imprisonment a great light of the world is in danger of being put out  Costain s character also comes to argue for emancipation of the Saxon villeins  serfs   linking political with intellectual enlightenment under the fictional Bacon s influence   In the novel The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco  the story follows the investigations of William of Baskerville  presented as an anachronistically empiricist contemporary and colleague of Roger Bacon who often quotes his late friend when explaining William s own methods   Roger Bacon is a supporting character in the video game series Shadow Hearts  He is portrayed as an immortal magician and scientist who is over 700 years old  Bacon is also mentioned briefly in Ubisoft s Assassin s Creed IV  Black Flag  in a readable document found by the player when hacking into various computer systems within the game s modern day setting   4  See also  Roger Bacon High School  Oxford
