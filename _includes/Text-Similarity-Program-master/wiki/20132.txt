continues to be the lead play by play announcer for National Basketball Association games on TNT  a position he assumed in 1999  Indeed  TNT has become his primary commitment ever since his longtime employer NBC lost the NBA broadcasting rights in 2002  and may have played a role in his departure from the Knicks  broadcast booth  The Knicks reportedly wanted Albert to accept a salary commensurate with his reduced Knicks schedule  but also weren t happy about Albert making what Knicks management felt were overly critical comments about their team in spite of their losing record  In basketball  his most famous call is his simple  Yes   for a basket  rendered in many variations of volume and length depending on the situation  and a catchphrase that he began using in his youth when playing pickup games with friends   On April 17  2002  shortly after calling a game between the Indiana Pacers and Philadelphia 76ers on TNT  both Albert and color analyst Mike Fratello were injured in a limo

struggles in the 2009–10 season  Nets management relegated Albert to secondary play by play  to avoid a similar incident while Albert was with the Knicks  Since then Ian Eagle has taken over the

including several who would serve long stints for other NHL teams  including Howie Rose  Mike Emrick and John Kelly  as well as brothers Al and Steve  It was Albert s absence from Game 7 of the

throwing her on a bed  biting her  and forcing her to perform oral sex after a February 12  1997 argument in his Pentagon City hotel room  DNA testing linked Albert to genetic material taken from the bite marks and from semen in Perhach s underwear  During the trial  testimony was presented from another woman  Patricia Masden  who told the jury that Albert had bitten her on two different occasions
