A watermark is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness darkness when viewed by transmitted light  or when viewed by reflected light  atop a dark background   caused by thickness or density variations in the paper  Watermarks have been used on postage stamps  currency  and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting  There are two main ways of producing watermarks in paper  the dandy roll process  and the more complex cylinder mould process   Watermarks vary greatly in their visibility  while some are obvious on casual inspection  others require some study to pick out  Various aids have been developed  such as watermark fluid that wets the paper without damaging it  Watermarks are often used as security features of banknotes  passports  postage stamps  and other documents to prevent counterfeiting  see security paper    A watermark is very useful in the examination of paper because it can be used for dating  identifying sizes  mill trademarks and locations  and determining the quality of a sheet of paper   Encoding an identifying code into digitized music  video  picture  or other file is known as a digital watermark   1  Dandy roll process  A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing  While watermarks were first introduced in Fabriano  Italy  in 1282  the invention of the dandy roll in 1826 by John Marshall revolutionised the watermark process and made it easier for producers to watermark their paper   The dandy roll is a light roller covered by material similar to window screen that is embossed with a pattern  Faint lines are made by laid wires that run parallel to the axis of the dandy roll  and the bold lines are made by chain wires that run around the circumference to secure the laid wires to the roll from the outside  Because the chain wires are located on the outside of the laid wires  they have a greater influence on the impression in the pulp  hence their bolder appearance than the laid wire lines   This embossing is transferred to the pulp fibres  compressing and reducing their thickness in that area  Because the patterned portion of the page is thinner  it transmits more light through and therefore has a lighter appearance than the surrounding paper  If these lines are distinct and parallel  and or there is a watermark  then the paper is termed laid paper  If the lines appear as a mesh or are indiscernible  and or there is no watermark  then it is called wove paper  This method is called line drawing watermarks   2  Cylinder mould process  Another type of watermark is called the cylinder mould watermark  A shaded watermark  first used in 1848  incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image  Instead of using a wire covering for the dandy roll  the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll s own surface  Once dry  the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density  The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process  and as such Cylinder Mould Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes  passports  motor vehicle titles  and other documents where it is an important anti counterfeiting measure   3  Watermarks on postage stamps and stationery  In philately  the watermark is a key feature of a stamp  and often constitutes the difference between a common and a rare stamp  Collectors who encounter two otherwise identical stamps with different watermarks consider each stamp to be a separate identifiable issue  The  classic  stamp watermark is a small crown or other national symbol  appearing either once on each stamp or a continuous pattern  Watermarks were nearly universal on stamps in the 19th and early 20th centuries  but generally fell out of use and are not commonly used on modern U S  issues  but some countries continue to use them   Some types of embossing  such as that used to make the  cross on oval  design on early stamps of Switzerland  resemble a watermark in that the paper is thinner  but can be distinguished by having sharper edges than is usual for a normal watermark  Stamp paper watermarks also show various designs  letters  numbers and pictorial elements   The process of bringing out the stamp watermark is fairly simple  Sometimes a watermark in stamp paper can be seen just by looking at the unprinted back side of a stamp  More often  the collector must use a few basic items to get a good look at the watermark  For example  watermark fluid may be applied to the back of a stamp to temporarily reveal the watermark   Even using the simple watermarking method described  it can be difficult to distinguish some watermarks  Watermarks on stamps printed in yellow and orange can be particularly difficult to see  A few mechanical devices are also are used by collectors to detect watermarks on stamps such as the Morley Bright watermark detector and the more expensive Safe Signoscope  Such devices can be very useful for they can be used without the application of watermark fluid and also allow the collector to look at the watermark for a longer period of time to more easily detect the watermark   4  See also  Audio watermark detection  Digital watermarking  Thomas Harry
