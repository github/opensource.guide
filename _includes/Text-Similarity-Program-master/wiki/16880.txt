Kaveri and its tributaries  the Hemavati  Shimsha  Arkavati  Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini  in the south  Both these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward into the Bay of Bengal   Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka  the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu  meaning  elevated land   Karu nadu may also be read as karu  meaning  black   and nadu  meaning  region   as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state  The British used the word Carnatic  sometimes Karnatak  to describe both sides of peninsular India  south of the Krishna   With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic  Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and

Karnataka s pre history goes back to a paleolithic hand axe culture evidenced by discoveries of  among other things  hand axes and cleavers in the region  Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state  Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka  prompting scholars to hypothesize about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilization ca  3300 BCE   Prior to the third century BCE  most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka  Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed  allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka  The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms  the Kadambas and the Western Gangas  marking the region s emergence as an independent political entity  The Kadamba Dynasty  founded by Mayurasharma  had its capital at Banavasi  the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital   These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration  as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth century copper coin discovered at Banavasi  These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas  the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta and the Western Chalukya Empire  which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka  The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of 12th century  Parts of modern day Southern Karnataka  Gangavadi  were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of 11th century  The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule   At the turn of the first millennium  the Hoysalas gained power in the region  Literature flourished during this time  which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres  and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture  The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule  In the early 14th century  Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital  Hosapattana  later named Vijayanagara   on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district  The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India  which it completely controlled for over two centuries   In 1565  Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota  The Bijapur Sultanate  which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar  soon took control of the Deccan  it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century  The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo Saracenic architecture  the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style  During the sixteenth century  Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka  mostly from Salcette  Goa  while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century  Goan Catholics migrated to South Canara  especially from Bardes  Goa  as a result of food shortages  epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese   In the period that followed  parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad  the Maratha Empire  the British  and other powers  In the south  the Mysore Kingdom  a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire  was briefly independent  With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II  Haidar Ali  the commander in chief of the Mysore army  gained control of the region  After his death  the kingdom was inherited by his son Tippu Sultan  To contain European expansion in South India  Haidar Ali and later Tippu Sultan fought four significant Anglo Mysore Wars  the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan s death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799  The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj   As the  doctrine of lapse  gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country  Kittur Chennamma  Sangolli Rayanna and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830  nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857  Other uprisings followed  such as the ones at Supa  Bagalkot  Shorapur  Nargund and Dandeli  These rebellions   which coincided with the 1857 war of independence   were led by Mundargi Bhimarao  Bhaskar Rao Bhave  the Halagali Bedas  Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others  By the late 19th century  the freedom movement had gained momentum  Karnad Sadashiva Rao  Aluru Venkata Raya  S  Nijalingappa  Kengal Hanumanthaiah  Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century   After India s independence  the Maharaja  Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar  allowed his kingdom s accession to India  In 1950  Mysore became an Indian state of the same name  the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh  head of state  until 1975  Following the long standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement  Kodagu  and Kannada speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras  Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state  under the States Reorganization Act of 1956  The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka  seventeen years later  in 1973  In the early 1900s through the post independence era  industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya born in Muddenahalli  near Kanivenarayanapura  Chikballapur District played an important role in the development of Karnataka s strong manufacturing and industrial base   2  Geography  The state has three principal geographical zones   The coastal region of Karavali  The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western
