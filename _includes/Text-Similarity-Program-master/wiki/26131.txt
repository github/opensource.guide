Racial profiling is the use of an individual’s race or ethnicity by law enforcement personnel as a key factor in deciding whether to engage in enforcement  e g  stop and search or arrest   The practice is controversial and is illegal in many jurisdictions  It should not be confused with offender profiling  which is an investigative tool   1  Definition  Discrimination based on stereotypes  does not have to be through law enforcement  The concept of racial profiling has been defined in many ways  including    Any police initiated action that relies on the race  ethnicity  or national origin rather than the behavior of an individual or information that leads the police to a particular individual who has been identified as being  or having been  engaged in criminal activity    Deborah Ramirez  Jack McDevitt  Amy Farrell for US DoJ   Racially biased policing occurs when law enforcement inappropriately considers race or ethnicity in deciding with whom and how to intervene in an enforcement capacity   Lorie Fridell  Robert Lunney  Drew Diamond and Bruce Kubu   Using race as a key factor in deciding whether to make a traffic stop    General Accounting Office   In the literature to date  there appear to be at least two clearly distinguishable definitions of the term  racial profiling   a narrow definition and a broad definition    Under the narrow definition  racial profiling occurs when a police officer stops  questions  arrests  and or searches someone solely on the basis of the person s race or ethnicity    Under the broader definition  racial profiling occurs whenever police routinely use race as a factor that  along with an accumulation of other factors  causes an officer to react with suspicion and take action   Jim Cleary  2  In the United States  Examples of racial profiling on ethnic groups in the U S  include African Americans   Gangs  Hispanic and Latinos   Illegal Immigration  and Arab and Muslims South Asians   Terrorism   2 1  History  The existence of racial profiling dates back to slavery  In 1693  Philadelphia’s court officials gave police legal authority to stop and detain any Negro  freed or slaved  seen wandering around on the streets  This discriminatory practice continued through the Jim Crow era and now in the twentyfirst century  racial profiling is prevalent across cities in the U S   2 2  Legality  In 1996 the U S  Supreme Court ruled in U S  v  Armstrong that racial profiling is constitutional in the absence of data that  similarly situated  defendants of another race were disparately treated  overturning a 9th Circuit Court ruling that law enforcement must proceed on  the presumption that people of all races commit all types of crimes   not with the premise that any type of crime is the exclusive province of any particular racial or ethnic group   waving away challenges based on the Fourth Amendment of the U S  Constitution which guarantees the right to be safe from search and seizure without a warrant  which is to be issued  upon probable cause    and the Fourteenth Amendment which requires that all citizens be treated equally under the law  To date there have been no known cases in which any U S  court dismissed a criminal prosecution because the defendant was targeted based on race  This Supreme Court decision doesn t prohibit government agencies from enacting policies prohibiting it in the field by agents and employees   In his February 27  2001 address to a Joint Session of Congress  President George W  Bush declared   Racial profiling is wrong  and we will end it in America  In so doing  we will not hinder the work of our nation s brave police officers  They protect us every day    often at great risk  But by stopping the abuses of a few  we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve    In June 2001 the Bureau of Justice Assistance  a component of the Office of Justice Programs of the United States Department of Justice  awarded a Northeastern research team a grant to create the web based Racial Profiling Data Collection Resource Center  It now maintains a website designed to be a central clearinghouse for police agencies  legislators  community leaders  social scientists  legal researchers  and journalists to access information about current data collection efforts  legislation and model policies  police community initiatives  and methodological tools that can be used to collect and analyze racial profiling data  The website contains information on the background of data collection  jurisdictions currently collecting data  community groups  legislation that is pending and enacted in states across the country  and has information on planning and implementing data collection procedures  training officers in to implement these systems  and analyzing and reporting the data and results   In June 2003 the Department of Justice issued its Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agenciesm forbidding racial profiling by federal law enforcement officials   Several U S  states now have reporting requirements for incidents of racial profiling  Texas  for example requires all agencies to provide annual reports to its Law Enforcement Commission  The requirement began on September 1  2001  when the State of Texas passed a law to require all law enforcement agencies in the State to begin collecting certain data in connection to traffic or pedestrian stops beginning on January 1  2002  Based on that data  the law mandated law enforcement agencies to submit a report to the law enforcement agencies  governing body beginning March 1  2003 and each year thereafter no later than March 1  The law is found in the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure beginning with Article 2 131  Additionally  on January 1  2011  all law enforcement agencies began submitting annual reports to the Texas State Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education Commission  The submitted reports can be accessed on the Commission s website for public review   2 2 1  Arizona SB 1070  In April 2010  Arizona enacted SB 1070  a law that would require law enforcement officers to verify the citizenship of individuals they stop if they have reasonable suspicion that they may be in the United States illegally  The law states that “Any person who is arrested shall have the person’s immigration status determined before the person is released”  United States federal law requires that all undocumented immigrants who remain in the United States for more than 30 days are to register with the U S  government and to have all registration documents with them at all time  Arizona made it a misdemeanor crime for an undocumented immigrant 14 years of age and older to be found without carrying these documents at all times   According to SB 1070  law enforcement officials may not consider “race  color  or national origin” in the enforcement of the law  except under the circumstances allowed under the United States and Arizona constitutions  In June 2012  the majority of SB 1070 was struck down by the United States Supreme Court  while the provision allowing for an immigration check on detained persons was upheld   2 3  Support  According to a 2011 survey by Rasmussen Reports  a majority of Americans support profiling as necessary  in today s society    In December 2010  Fernando Mateo  then president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers  made some pro racial profiling remarks in the case of gun shot taxi cab driver   You know sometimes it’s good that we are racially profiled because the God’s honest truth is that 99 percent of the people that are robbing  stealing  killing these drivers are blacks and Hispanics    Clearly everyone knows I’m not racist  I’m Hispanic and my father is black      My father is blacker than Al Sharpton    2 4  Criticism  Critics of racial profiling argue that the individual rights of a suspect are violated if race is used as a factor in that suspicion  Notably  civil liberties organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  have labeled racial profiling as a form of discrimination  stating   Discrimination based on race  ethnicity  religion  nationality or on any other particular identity undermines the basic human rights and freedoms to which every person is entitled    Responding to such criticisms are local community groups who seek to collect data  analyze trends and how they might correspond to public perceptions of profiling  and solicit ideas aimed at diminishing cultural and racial biases   2 5  In practice  The airline ticketing agent who checked in Mohamed Atta  the purported leader of the September 11 attacks  and a companion  would afterwards say that looking at the pair his first reaction was to think   If this doesn t look like two Arab terrorists  I ve never seen two Arab terrorists   The pair was dressed in simple suit and tie attire  The agent immediately felt guilty since they looked like ordinary businessmen  He later remarked that Atta  had the deadest eyes  he d  ever seen  which made him stand out from other businessmen  However  he had no legal grounds to search on the basis of their suspicious appearance had he wished to   In December 2001  an American citizen of Middle Eastern descent named Assem Bayaa cleared all the security checks at Los Angeles airport and attempted to board a flight to New York  Upon boarding  he was told that he made the passengers uncomfortable by being on board the plane and was asked to leave  Once off the plane  he wasn t searched or questioned any further and the only consolation he was given was a boarding pass for the next flight  He filed a lawsuit on the basis of discrimination against United Airlines  United Airlines filed a counter motion which was dismissed by a district judge on October 11  2002  In June 2005  the ACLU announced a settlement between Bayaa and United Airlines who still disputed Bayaa s allegations  but noted that the settlement  was in the best interest of all    In the case of racial profiling drivers  the ethnic backgrounds of drivers stopped by traffic police in the US suggests the possibility of biased policing against colored drivers  Black drivers felt that they were being pulled over by law enforcement officers simply because of their skin color  However  some argue in favor of the “veil of darkness” hypothesis  which states that police are less likely to know the race of a driver before they make a stop at nighttime as opposed to in the daytime  Referring to the veil of darkness hypothesis  it is suggested that if the race distribution of drivers stopped during the day differs from that of drivers stopped at night  officers are engaging in racial profiling  For example  in one study done by Jeffrey Grogger and Greg Ridgeway  the veil of darkness hypothesis was used to determine whether or not racial profiling in traffic stops occurs in Oakland  California  The conductors found that there was little evidence of racial profiling in traffic stops made in Oakland  Legislation has been proposed with the intent of ending racial profiling in traffic stops  There have been many states that have begun collecting data on the details of the traffic stops in order to monitor racial profiling  Profiling is on an individual basis and it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of arrests or stops since the studies allow officers to change their behavior accordingly  For example  in the court case of City of Los Angeles v  Lyons  Adolf Lyons was stopped by police officers because of a faulty taillight  police officers choked him until he was unconscious  Plaintiffs in the case promoted equality yet it was ultimately dependent on appearance and race  In a recent journal comparing the 1990s to the present  studies have established that when the community criticized police for targeting the black community during traffic stops it received more media coverage and toned down racial profiling  However  whenever there was a significant lack of media coverage or concern with racial profiling  the amount of arrests and traffic stops for the African American community would significantly rise again   2 5 1  NYPD Demographics Unit  Between 2003舑14  the New York City Police Department  NYPD  operated the Demographics Unit  later renamed Zone Assessment Unit  which mapped communities of 28  ancestries of interest   including those of Muslims  Arabs  and Albanians  Plain clothed detectives were sent to public places such as coffee shops  mosques and parks to observe and record the public sentiment  as well as map locations where potential terrorists could  blend in   In its 11 years of operation  however  the unit did not generate any information leading to a criminal charge  A series of publications by the Associated Press during 2011舑12 gave rise to public pressure to close the unit  and it was finally disbanded in 2014   2 5 2  Urban communities  Some believe that inner city residents of Hispanic communities are subjected to racial profiling because of theories such as the “gang suppression model”  The “gang suppression model” is believed by some to be the basis for increased policing  the theory being based on the idea that Latinos are violent and out of control and are therefore “in need of suppression”  Based on research  the criminalization of a people can lead to abuses of power on behalf of law enforcement   Research through random sampling in the South Tucson  Arizona area has established that immigration authorities sometimes target the residents of barrios with the use of possibly discriminatory policing based on racial profiling  Author Mary Romero writes that immigration raids are often carried out at places of gathering and cultural expression such as grocery stores based on the fluency of language of a person  e g  being bilingual especially in Spanish  and skin color of a person  She goes on to state that immigration raids are often conducted with a disregard for due process  and that these raids lead people from these communities to distrust law enforcement   2 6  Islamophobia  2 6 1  In practice  The September 11  2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have led to targeting of some Muslims and Middle Easterners as potential terrorists and  according to some  are targeted by the national government through preventive measures similar to those practiced by local law enforcement  The national government has passed laws  such as the Patriot Act of 2001  to increase surveillance of potential threats to national threat as a result of the events that occurred during 9 11  It is argued that the passage of these laws and provisions by the national government leads to justification of preventative methods  such as racial profiling  that has been controversial for racial profiling and leads to further minority distrust in the national government  One of the techniques used by the FBI to target Muslims was monitoring 100 mosques and business in Washington DC and threatened to deport Muslims who did not agree to serve as informers  The FBI denied to be taking part of blanket profiling and argued that they were trying to build trust within the Muslim community   The events of 9 11 also led to restrictions on immigration laws  The government imposed stricter immigration quotas to maintain national security at their national borders  In 2002  men over sixteen years old who entered the country from twenty five Middle Eastern countries and North Korea were required to be photographed  fingerprinted  interviewed and have their financial information copied  and had to register again before leaving the country   2 7  Criminal profiling  When confronted with accusations of racial profiling the police claim that they do not participate in it  They claim that they use numerous factors  such as race  interactions  and dress  to determine if a person is involved in criminal activity   They further claim that the job of policing is far more imperative than to concerns of minorities or interest groups claiming unfair targeting   2 8  Law enforcement  Racial profiling not only occurs on the streets but also in many institutions  Much like the book Famous all over Town where the author Danny Santiago mentions this type of racism throughout the novel  Racial profiling is huge in law enforcement  where this type of behavior can risk the lives of innocent people  In a trusted source it is said  It is argued that  given the assumption that criminals are currently being punished too severely in Western countries  the apprehension of more criminals may not constitute a reason in favor of racial profiling at all   Ryberg  It has been stated in a scholarly journal that for over 30 years the use of racial and or demographic profiling by local authorities and higher level law enforcement s continue to proceed  NYPD Street cops use racial profiling more often  due to the widespread patterns  They first frisk them to check whether they have enough evidence to be even arrested for the relevant crime   As a practical matter  the stops display a measurable racial disparity  black and Hispanic people generally represent more than 85 percent of those stopped by the police  though their combined populations make up a small share of the city’s racial composition   Baker   2 9  Some general examples of racial profiling by police  A few examples of racial profiling by police may include   An African American man standing on a corner waiting for a bus is stopped and questioned regarding why he is standing there and where he is going   A Hispanic driver is stopped in a  white  neighbourhood because he  doesn’t belong there  or  looks out of place    Latino residents experienced racial affronts targeted at their “Mexicanness” indicated by skin color  bilingual speaking abilities  or shopping in neighborhoods highly populated by Latinos  During immigration inspections  individuals stopped were demeaned  humiliated and embarrassed   A group of black teenagers are pulled over because of the kind of car they are driving  Racial profiling is also used as a basis of discrimination for employment  services  housing  etc   or to give preferential treatment to an individual or group of people because of their race or ethnicity   2 10  Racial profiling in practice  On September 14  2001 three days after the September 11th attacks  an Indian American motorist and three family members were pulled over and ticketed by a Maryland state trooper because their car had broken taillights  The trooper interrogated the family  questioned them about their nationality  and asked for proof of citizenship  When the motorist said that their passports were at home  the officer allegedly stated   You are lying  You are Arabs involved in terrorism   He ordered them out of the car  had them put their hands on the hood  and searched the car  When he discovered a knife in a toolbox  the officer handcuffed the driver and later reported that the driver  wore and carried a butcher knife  a dangerous deadly weapon  concealed upon and about his person   The driver was detained for several hours but eventually released   2 11  Empirical evidence  Statistical data demonstrates  that although policing practices and policies vary widely across the United States  a large disparity between racial groups in regards to traffic stops and searches  However  whether this is due to racial profiling or the fact that different races are involved in crime in different rates  is still highly debated  Based on academic search  various studies have been conducted regarding the existence of racial profiling in traffic and pedestrian stops  For motor vehicle searches academic research showed that the probability of a successful search is very similar across races  This suggests that police officers are not motivated by racial preferences but by the desire to maximize the probability of a successful search  Similar evidence has been found for pedestrian stops  with identical ratios of stops to arrests for different races  The studies have been published in various Academic Journals aimed towards Academic professionals as well practitioners such as law enforcers  Some of these journals include  Police Quarterly and the Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice  so that both sides of the argument are present and evaluated  Of those gathered the most noted study refuting racial profiling was the conducted using the veil of darkness hypothesis stating that it will be difficult  if not impossible  for officers to discern race in the twilight hours  The results of this study concluded that the ratio of different races stopped by New York cops is about the same for all races tested  Some of the most referenced organizations  who offer evidence on the existence of racial profiling  noted are The American Civil Liberties Union  which has conducted studies various major U S  cities  and RAND  In a study conducted in have Cincinnati  Ohio it was concluded that “Blacks were between three and five times more likely to  a  be asked if they were carrying drugs or weapons   b  be asked to leave the vehicle   c  be searched   d  have a passenger searched  and  e  have the vehicle physically searched in a study conducted  This conclusion was based on the analysis of 313  randomly selected  traffic stop police tapes gathered from 2003 to 2004   As a response of incident in Ferguson on August 9 2014  the Department of Justice recruited in September a team of criminal justice researchers to study racial bias in law enforcement in five cities and to subsequently devise strategic recommendations   2 12  Public opinion  2 12 1  Perceptions of race and safety  In a particular study  Higgins  Gabbidon  and Vito studied the relationship between public opinion on racial profiling in conjunction with their viewpoint of race relations and their perceived awareness of safety  It was found that race relations had a statistical correlation with the legitimacy of racial profiling  Specifically  results showed that those who believed that racial profiling was widespread and that racial tension would never be fixed were more likely to be opposed to racial profiling than those who did not believe racial profiling was as widespread or that racial tensions would be fixed eventually  On the other hand  in reference to perception of safety  the research concluded that one’s perception of safety had no influence on public opinion of racial profiling  Higgins  Gabbidon  and Vito acknowledge that this may not have been the case immediately after 9 11  but state that any support of racial profiling based on safety was “short lived”   2 12 2  Influence of religious affiliation  One particular study focused on individuals who self identified as religiously affiliated and their relationship with racial profiling  By using national survey data from October 2001  researcher Phillip H  Kim studied which individuals were more likely to support racial profiling  The research concludes that individuals that identified themselves as either Jewish  Catholic  or Protestant showed higher statistical numbers that illustrated support for racial profiling in comparison to individuals who identified themselves as non religious   2 12 3  The context of terrorism and crime  After the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks on the United States  according to Johnson  a new debate concerning the appropriateness of racial profiling in the context of terrorism took place  According to Johnson  prior to the September 11  2001 attacks the debate on racial profiling within the public targeted primarily African Americans and Latino Americans with enforced policing on crime and drugs  The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon changed the focus of the racial profiling debate from street crime and “driving while Black” to terrorism and “flying while Arab ” According to a June 4–5  2002 FOX News Opinion Dynamics Poll  54% of Americans approved of using “racial profiling to screen Arab male airline passengers ” A 2002 survey by Public Agenda tracked the attitudes toward the racial profiling of Blacks and people of Middle Eastern descent  In this survey  52% of Americans said there was “no excuse” for law enforcement to look at African Americans with greater suspicion and scrutiny because they believe they are more likely to commit crimes  but only 21% said there was “no excuse” for extra scrutiny of Middle Eastern people   However  using data from an internet survey based experiment performed in 2006 on a random sample of 574 adult university students  a study was conducted that examined public approval for the use of racial profiling to prevent crime and terrorism  It was found that approximately one third of students approved the use of racial profiling in general  Furthermore  it was found that students were equally likely to approve of the use of racial profiling to prevent crime as to prevent terrorism 33% and 35 8% respectively  The survey also asked respondents whether they would approve of racial profiling across different investigative contexts  It was found that 23 8% of people approved of law enforcement using racial profiling as a means to stop and question someone in a terrorism context while 29 9% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation  It was found that 25 3% of people approved of law enforcement using racial profiling as a means to search someone’s bags or packages in a terrorism context while 33 5% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation  It was also found that 16 3% of people approved of law enforcement wire tapping a person’s phone based upon racial profiling in the context of terrorism while 21 4% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation  It was also found that 14 6% of people approved of law enforcement searching someone’s home based upon racial profiling in a terrorism context while 18 2% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation   The study also found that white students were more likely to approve of racial profiling to prevent terrorism than nonwhite students  However  it was found that white students and nonwhite students held the same views about racial profiling in the context of crime  It was also found that foreign born students were less likely to approve of racial profiling to prevent terrorism than non foreign born students while both groups shared similar views on racial profiling in the context of crime   3  In other countries  3 1  Canada  Accusations of racial profiling of visible minorities who accuse police of targeting them due to their ethnic background is a growing concern in Canada  In 2005  the Kingston Police released the first study ever in Canada which pertains to racial profiling  The study focused on in the city of Kingston  a small city where most of the inhabitants are white  The study showed that black skinned people were 3 7 times more likely to be pulled over by police than white skinned people  while Asian people were less likely to be pulled over than whites or blacks  Several police organizations condemned this study and suggested more studies like this would make them hesitant to pull over visible minorities   Canadian Aboriginals are more likely to be charged with crimes  particularly on reserves  The Canadian crime victimization survey does not collect data on the ethnic origin of perpetrators  so comparisons between incidence of victimizations and incidence of charging are impossible  Although aboriginal persons make up 3 6% of Canada s population  they account for 20% of Canada s prison population  This may show how racial profiling increases effectiveness of police  or be a result of racial profiling  as they are watched more intensely than others   In February 2010  an investigation of the Toronto Star daily newspaper found that black people across Toronto were three times more likely to be stopped and documented by police than white people  To a lesser extent  the same seemed true for people described by police as having  brown  skin  South Asians  Arabs and Latinos    This was the result of an analysis of 1 7 million contact cards filled out by Toronto Police officers in the period 2003   2008   The Ontario Human Rights Commission states that  police services have acknowledged that racial profiling does occur and have taken  and are taking  measures to address  the issue   including upgrading training for officers  identifying officers at risk of engaging in racial profiling  and improving community relations   Griffiths  2008  p  311   Ottawa Police addressed this issue and planned on implementing a new policy regarding officer racially profiling persons   the policy explicitly forbids officers from investigating or detaining anyone based on their race and will force officers to go through training on racial profiling   CTV News  2011   This policy was implemented after the 2008 incident where an African Canadian woman was strip searched by members of the Ottawa police  There is a video showing the strip search where one witnesses the black woman being held to the ground and the having her bra and shirt cut ripped cut off by a member of the Ottawa Police Force which was released to the viewing of the public in 2010  CTV News  2011    3 2  Mexico  Mexico has been criticized for its immigration policy  Chris Hawley of USA Today stated that  Mexico has a law that is no different from Arizona s   referring to legislation which gives local police forces the power to check documents of people suspected of being in the country illegally  Immigration and human rights activists have also noted that Mexican authorities frequently engage in racial profiling  harassment  and shakedowns against migrants from Central America   3 3  Germany  As of February 2012 there has been a first court ruling concerning racial profiling in German police policy  It had at first been declared legal for police to make skin color and  non German ethnic origin  criteria for the selection of persons who will be asked for identification in spot checks for illegal immigrants  However  in subsequence to the ruling it was decided legal for a subject of such a spot check to compare such policy to that of the SS in public  A higher court later declared the earlier decision to be void and the racial profiling to have been unlawful and in violation of anti discrimination provisions in Art  3 Basic Law and the General Equal Treatment Act of 2006   In the Nazi period  racial ethnicity profiling was commonplace  The ethnicity religion  such as Judaism was noted on mandatory identity documents  Certain groups were obligied to wear visible marks such as the star of David on their clothes  Disobedience could be checked through the identity document   4  See also  Affirmative action  Institutional racism  Contempt of cop  De policing  Driving While Black  Police misconduct  Race and crime in the United States
