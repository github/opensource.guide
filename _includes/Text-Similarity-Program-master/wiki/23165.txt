Position in poker refers to the order in which players are seated around the table and the related poker strategy implications  Players who act first are in  early position   players who act later are in  late position   players who act in between are in  middle position   A player  has position  on opponents acting before him and is  out of position  to opponents acting after him  Because players act in clockwise order  a player  has position  on opponents seated to his right  except when the opponent has the button and certain cases in the first betting round of games with blinds   1  Position in Texas hold  em  The primary advantage held by a player in late position is that he will have more information with which to make better decisions than players in early position  who will have to act first  without the benefit of this extra information  This advantage has led to many players in heads up play raising on the button with an extremely wide range of hands because of this positional advantage  Also  as earlier opponents fold  the probability of a hand being the best goes up as the number of opponents goes down   The blinds are the least desirable position because a player is forced to contribute to the pot and they must act first on all betting rounds after the flop  Although the big blind has a big advantage on the first round of betting  it is on average the biggest money losing position   2  Texas hold  em example  There are 10 players playing $4 $8 fixed limit  Alice pays the $2 small blind  Bob pays the $4 big blind  Carol is under the gun  first to act   If Carol has a hand like K♥ J♠  she may choose to fold  With 9 opponents remaining to act  there is approximately a 40% chance that at least one of them will have a better hand than Carol s like A A  K K  Q Q  J J  A K  A Q  A J or K Q  And even if no one does  seven of them  all but the two players in the blind  will have position on Carol in the next three betting rounds   Now instead  suppose David in the cut off position  to the right of the button  has the same K♥ J♠ and all players fold to him  In this situation  there are only three opponents left to act  so the odds that one of them has a better hand are considerably less  only around 16%   Secondly  two of those three  Alice and Bob  will be out of position to David on later betting rounds  A common play would be for David to raise and hope that the button  the only player who has position on David  folds  David s raise might simply steal the blinds if they don t have playable hands  but if they do play  David will be in good shape to take advantage of his position in later betting rounds   3  See also  Poker jargon  4  References  5  External links
