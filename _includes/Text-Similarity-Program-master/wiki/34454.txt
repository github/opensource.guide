Zosimus     also known by the Latin name Zosimus Historicus  i e   Zosimus the Historian   fl  490s–510s  was a Byzantine historian  who lived in Constantinople during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I  491–518   According to Photius  he was a comes  and held the office of  advocate  of the imperial treasury   1  Historia Nova  Zosimus  Historia Nova  Ἱστορία Νέα   New History    is written in Greek in six books  For the period from 238 to 270  he apparently uses Dexippus  for the period from 270 to 404  Eunapius  and after 407  Olympiodorus  His dependence upon his sources is made clear by the change in tone and style between the Eunapian and Olympiodoran sections  and by the gap left in between them  In the Eunapian section  for example  he is pessimistic and critical of Stilicho  in the Olympiodoran section  he offers precise figures and transliterations from the Latin  and favors Stilicho   The first book sketches briefly the history of the early Roman emperors from Augustus to Diocletian  305   the second  third and fourth deal more fully with the period from the accession of Constantius Chlorus and Galerius to the death of Theodosius I  the fifth and sixth  the most useful for historians  cover the period between 395 and 410  when Priscus Attalus was deposed  for this period  he is the most important surviving non ecclesiastical source  The work  which breaks off abruptly in the summer of 410 at the beginning of the sixth book  is believed to have been written in 498–518   The style is characterized by Photius as concise  clear and pure  other historians have judged his accounts confused or muddled  and valuable only because he preserves information from lost histories  The historian s object was to account for the decline of the Roman Empire from the polytheistic point of view  Zosimus is the only non Christian source for much of what he reports   In contrast to Polybius  who had narrated the rise of the Roman Empire  Zosimus documented the events and causes which led to its decline  i  57   Though the decline of the Roman Empire was Zosimus  primary subject  he also discussed events connected with Persian  Greek  and Macedonian history  perhaps in imitation of Polybius  It is clear that Photius and Evagrius did not have any more of Zosimus  work than what survives today  Yet it is likely that either a part of the work has been lost or  more likely  that Zosimus did not live to finish it  for it does not cover all the areas that Zosimus himself tells us he intended to discuss  iv  59  §4  5  i  58  §9  iv  28  §3   There does not seem much probability in the conjecture that the monks and other ecclesiastics succeeded in suppressing that portion of the work in which the evil influences of their body were to be more especially touched upon  If the work was thus left incomplete  that circumstance would account for some carelessness of style which is here and there apparent  There may appear some difficulty at first sight  however  in the statement of Photius  that the work  in the form in which he saw it  appeared to him to be a second edition  But it would seem that Photius was under some misapprehension  It is called in the manuscripts Historia Nova  in what sense is not quite clear   This may perhaps have misled Photius  He himself remarks that he had not seen the first edition   Zosimus was a polytheist  and is by no means sparing of the faults and crimes of the Christian emperors  In consequence of this his credibility has been fiercely assailed by several Christian writers  and has been sometimes defended merely because his history tended to the discredit of many leading persons in the Christian party  The question does not  as has sometimes been supposed  turn upon the credibility of the historians whom Zosimus followed  for he did not adhere in all cases to their judgment with respect to events and characters  For instance  although Zosimus followed Eunapius for the period 270–404  he entirely differed from Eunapius in his account of Stilicho and Serena  Of modern writers  Baronius  Lelio Bisciola  C  v  Barth  J  D  Ritter  Richard Bentley  and G  E  M  de Ste  Croix  have taken the derogatory side  Bentley in particular speaks of Zosimus with great contempt  On the other hand  his historical authority has been maintained by Leunclavius  G  B  von Schirach  J  Matth  Schrockh  and Reitemeier  There are no doubt numerous errors of judgment to be found in the work  and sometimes  especially in the case of Constantine  an intemperate expression of opinion  which somewhat exaggerates  if it does not distort the truth  It is not to be wondered at that one who held to the old faith should attribute the downfall of the Roman Empire in great part to the religious innovations attendant upon the spread of Christianity   2  Editions  The history of Zosimus was first printed in the Latin translation of Leunclavius  accompanied by a defence of the historian  Basel  1576  fol    The first two books  in Greek  with the translation of Leunclavius  were printed by H  Stephanus  in his edition of Herodian  Paris  1581   The first complete edition of the Greek text of Zosimus was that by F  Sylburg  Scriptores Hist  Rom  Min   vol  iii    Later editions are those published at Oxford  1679   at Zeitz and Jena  edited by Cellarius  with annotations of his own and others  1679  1713  1729   The next edition is that by Reitemeier  who  though he consulted no fresh manuscripts  made good use of the critical remarks of Heyne and other scholars  Leipzig  1784   Bekker produced a reliable edition in 1837 at Bonn  There is a German translation by Seybold and Heyler  and also an English and a French translation   Schöll  Gesch  d  Griech  Lit  vol  iii  p  232   Fabric  Bibl  Graec  vol  viii  p  62    The single good manuscript  in the Vatican Library  MS Vat  Gr  156   was unavailable to scholars until the mid 19th century  Ludwig Mendelssohn  Leipzig 1887  edited the first dependable text  The modern standard edition is F  Paschoud Zosime  Histoire Nouvelle  Paris 1971  which has a French translation  introduction and commentary  A later edition in English   Zosimus  New History  a translation with commentary by Ronald T  Ridley  was published in 1982 by the Australian Association of Byzantine Studies   3
