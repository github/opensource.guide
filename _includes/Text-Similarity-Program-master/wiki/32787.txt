Vodka       is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol  sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings  Traditionally  vodka is made by the distillation of fermented grains or potatoes  though some modern brands use other substances  such as fruits or sugar   Since the 1890s  the standard Polish  Russian  Ukrainian  Estonian  Latvian  Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume ABV  80 proof   a percentage that is widely misattributed to Dmitri Mendeleev  The European Union has established a minimum of 37 5% ABV for any  European vodka  to be named as such  Products sold as  vodka  in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%  Even with these loose restrictions  most vodka sold contains 40% ABV  For homemade vodkas and distilled beverages referred to as  moonshine   see moonshine by country   Vodka is traditionally drunk neat  not mixed with any water  ice  or other mixer   though it is often served chilled in the vodka belt countries of Eastern Europe and around the Baltic Sea  It is also commonly used in cocktails and mixed drinks  such as the vodka martini  vodka tonic  Screwdriver  Greyhound  Black or White Russian  Bloody Mary  and Sex on the Beach   1  Etymology  The name  vodka  is a diminutive form of the Slavic word voda  water   interpreted as little water  root вод   vod    water  +  к    k    diminutive suffix  among other functions  +  a  postfix of feminine gender    The word  vodka  was recorded for the first time in 1405 in Akta Grodzkie  the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland  At the time  the word vodka  wódka  referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetics  cleansers  while the popular beverage was called gorzałka  from the Old Polish gorzeć meaning  to burn    which is also the source of Ukrainian horilka  горілка   The word vodka written in Cyrillic appeared first in 1533  in relation to a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the merchants of Kievan Rus    A number of Russian pharmaceutical lists contain the terms  vodka of grain wine   водка хлебного вина vodka khlebnogo vina  and  vodka in half of grain wine   водка полу хлебного вина vodka polu khlebnogo vina   As alcohol had long been used as a basis for medicines  this implies the term vodka could be a noun derived from the verb vodit’  razvodit’  водить  разводить    to dilute with water   Grain wine was a spirit distilled from alcohol made from grain  as opposed to grape wine  and hence  vodka of grain wine  would be a water dilution of a distilled grain spirit   Although the word vodka could be found in early manuscripts and in lubok pictograms  it began to appear in Russian dictionaries only in the mid 19th century  It was attested in Sámuel Gyarmathi s Russian German Hungarian glossary of 1799  where it is glossed with Latin vinum adustum   burnt  i e  distilled  wine     In English literature the word vodka was attested already in the late 18th century  In a book of his travels published in English in 1780  presumably  a translation from German   Johann Gottlieb Georgi correctly explained that  Kabak in the Russian language signifies a public house for the common people to drink vodka  a sort of brandy  in   William Tooke in 1799 glossed vodka as  rectified corn spirits   In French  Théophile Gautier in 1800 glossed it as a  grain liquor  served with meals in Poland  eau de vie de grain    Another possible connection of  vodka  with  water  is the name of the medieval alcoholic beverage aqua vitae  Latin  literally   water of life    which is reflected in Polish okowita  Ukrainian оковита  Belarusian акавіта  and Scandinavian akvavit   Note that whiskey has a similar etymology  from the Irish Scottish Gaelic uisce beatha uisge beatha    People in the area of vodka s probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning  to burn           Samogitian  degtėnė  is also in use  colloquially and in proverbs       In Russian during the 17th and 18th centuries  горящѣе вино or горячее вино  goryashchee vino   burning wine  or  hot wine   was widely used  Others languages include the German Branntwein  Danish brændevin      and  although the latter terms refer to any strong alcoholic beverage    2  History  Scholars debate the beginnings of vodka  It is a contentious issue because very little historical material is available  Vodka originated in Eastern Europe  The first production was either in Poland in the 8th century or in the area of today s Russia in the late 9th century according to different sources  According to the Gin and Vodka Association  GVA   the first distillery was documented over three hundred years later at Khlynovsk as reported in the Vyatka Chronicle of 1174  For many centuries  beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today  as the spirit at that time had a different flavor  color and smell  and was originally used as medicine  It contained little alcohol  an estimated maximum of about 14%  as only this amount can be attained by natural fermentation  The still  allowing for distillation   burning of wine    increased purity  and increased alcohol content  was invented in the 8th century   2 1  Poland  In Poland  vodka    obsolete  gorzałka  has been produced since the early Middle Ages with local traditions as varied as the production of cognac in France  or Scottish whisky   The world s first written mention of the drink and of the word  vodka  was in 1405 from Akta Grodzkie recorder of deeds  in the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland and it went on to become a popular drink there  At the time  the word wódka referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetics  cleansers  while the popular beverage currently known as vodka was called gorzałka  from the Old Polish verb gorzeć meaning  to burn    which is also the source of Ukrainian horilka  горілка   The word written in Cyrillic appeared first in 1533  in relation to a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the merchants of Kievan Rus    In these early days  the spirits were used mostly as medicines  Stefan Falimierz asserted in his 1534 works on herbs that vodka could serve  to increase fertility and awaken lust   Wódka lub gorzała  1614   by Jerzy Potański  contains valuable information on the production of vodka  Jakub Kazimierz Haur  in his book Skład albo skarbiec znakomitych sekretów ekonomii ziemiańskiej  A Treasury of Excellent Secrets about Landed Gentry s Economy  Kraków  1693   gave detailed recipes for making vodka from rye   Some Polish vodka blends go back centuries  Most notable are Żubrówka  from about the 16th century  Goldwasser  from the early 17th century  and aged Starka vodka  from the 16th century  In the mid 17th century  the szlachta  nobility of Poland  were granted a monopoly on producing and selling vodka in their territories  This privilege was a source of substantial profits  One of the most famous distilleries of the aristocracy was established by Princess Lubomirska and later operated by her grandson  Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki  The Vodka Industry Museum  located at the park of the Potocki country estate has an original document attesting that the distillery already existed in 1784  Today it operates as  Polmos Łańcut    Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century  initially at Kraków  whence spirits were exported to Silesia before 1550  Silesian cities also bought vodka from Poznań  a city that in 1580 had 498 working spirits distilleries  Soon  however  Gdańsk outpaced both these cities  In the 17th and 18th centuries  Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands  Denmark  England  Russia  Germany  Austria  Hungary  Romania  Ukraine  Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin   Early production methods were rudimentary  The beverage was usually low proof  and the distillation process had to be repeated several times  a three stage distillation process was common   The first distillate was called brantówka  the second was szumówka  and the third was okowita  from aqua vitae   which generally contained 70–80% ABV  Then the beverage was watered down  yielding a simple vodka  30–35% ABV   or a stronger one if the watering was done using an alembic  The exact production methods were described in 1768 by Jan Paweł Biretowski and in 1774 by Jan Chryzostom Pasek  The late 18th century inaugurated the production of vodka from various unusual substances including even the carrot   Though there was clearly a substantial vodka cottage industry in Poland back to the 16th century  the end of the 18th century marked the start of real industrial production of vodka in Poland  the eastern part of Poland was controlled by the Russian empire at that time   Vodkas produced by the nobility and clergy became a mass product  The first industrial distillery was opened in 1782 in Lwów by J  A  Baczewski  He was soon followed by Jakub Haberfeld  who in 1804 established a factory at Oświęcim  and by Hartwig Kantorowicz  who started producing Wyborowa in 1823 at Poznań  The implementation of new technologies in the latter half of the 19th century  which allowed the production of clear vodkas  contributed to their success  The first rectification distillery was established in 1871  In 1925  the production of clear vodkas was made a Polish government monopoly   After World War II  all vodka distilleries were taken over by Poland s Marxist–Leninist government  During the martial law of the 1980s  the sale of vodka was rationed  Following the success of the Solidarity movement and the abolition of single party rule in Poland  many distilleries began struggling financially  Some filed for bankruptcy  but many were privatized  leading to the creation of various new brands   2 2  Russia  A type of distilled liquor designated by the Russian word vodka came to Russia in the late 14th century  In 1386  the Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae   the water of life   to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy  The liquid obtained by distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a  spirit  of wine  spiritus vini in Latin   from where came the name of this substance in many European languages  like English spirit  or Russian     According to a legend  around 1430  a monk named Isidore from Chudov Monastery inside the Moscow Kremlin made a recipe of the first Russian vodka  Having a special knowledge and distillation devices  he became the creator of a new  higher quality type of alcoholic beverage  This  bread wine   as it was initially known  was for a long time produced exclusively in the Grand Duchy of Moscow and in no other principality of Rus   this situation persisted until the era of industrial production   Thus  this beverage was closely associated with Moscow   Until the mid 18th century  the drink remained relatively low in alcohol content  not exceeding 40% ABV  Multiple terms for the drink were recorded  sometimes reflecting different levels of quality  alcohol concentration  filtering  and the number of distillations  most commonly  it was referred to as  burning wine    bread wine   or even in some locations simply  wine   In some locations  grape wine may have been so expensive that it was a drink only for aristocrats  Burning wine was usually diluted with water to 24% ABV or less before drinking  It was mostly sold in taverns and was quite expensive  At the same time  the word vodka was already in use  but it described herbal tinctures  similar to absinthe   containing up to 75% ABV  and made for medicinal purposes   The first written usage of the word vodka in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Elizabeth of June 8  1751  which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries  By the 1860s  due to the government policy of promoting consumption of state manufactured vodka  it became the drink of choice for many Russians  In 1863  the government monopoly on vodka production was repealed  causing prices to plummet and making vodka available even to low income citizens  The taxes on vodka became a key element of government finances in Tsarist Russia  providing at times up to 40% of state revenue  By 1911  vodka comprised 89% of all alcohol consumed in Russia  This level has fluctuated somewhat during the 20th century  but remained quite high at all times  The most recent estimates put it at 70%  2001   Today  some popular Russian vodka producers or brands are  amongst others  Stolichnaya and Russian Standard   During the late 1970s  Russian culinary author William Pokhlebkin compiled a history of the production of vodka in Russia  as part of the Soviet case in a trade dispute  this was later published as A History of Vodka  Pokhlebkin claimed that while there is a wealth of publications about the history of consumption and distribution of vodka  virtually nothing had been written about vodka production  One of his assertions was that the word  vodka  was used in popular speech in Russia considerably earlier than the middle of the 18th century  but the word did not appear in print until the 1860s  Pokhlebkin s sources were challenged by David Christian in the Slavic Review in 1994  Christian criticised the lack of valid references in Pokhlebkin s works stating that his work has an obvious pro Russian bias  Pokhlebkin is also known for his Pan Slavic sympathies under the leadership of Russia  and sentiments which in David Christian s opinion discredits majority of his work  especially his History of Vodka   2 3  Sweden  Up until the 1950s  vodka was not used as a designation for Swedish distilled beverages  which were instead called brännvin   burn wine    This beverage has been produced in Sweden since the late 15th century  although the total production was still small in the 17th century  From the early 18th century  production expanded  although production was prohibited several times  during grain shortages  Although initially a grain product  potatoes started to be used in the production in the late 18th century  and became dominant from the early 19th century  From the early 1870s  distillery equipment was improved   Progressively from the 1960s  unflavoured Swedish brännvin also came to be called vodka  The first Swedish product to use this term was Explorer Vodka  which was created in 1958 and initially was intended for the American export market  In 1979  Absolut Vodka was launched  reusing the name of the old Absolut Rent Brännvin   absolutely pure brännvin   created in 1879   Vodka has become a popular source of insobriety among young people  with a flourishing black market  In 2013 the organizers of a so called  vodka car  were jailed for 2 5 years for having provided thousands of liters  mainly to underaged girls   3  Production  Vodka may be distilled from any starch  or sugar rich plant matter  most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum  corn  rye or wheat  Among grain vodkas  rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior  Some vodkas are made from potatoes  molasses  soybeans  grapes  rice  sugar beets and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing  In some Central European countries  such as Poland  some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast  In the European Union there are talks about the standardization of vodka  and the Vodka Belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains  potato and sugar beet molasses be allowed to be branded as  vodka   following the traditional methods of production   In the United States  many vodkas are made from 95% ethanol produced in large quantities by agricultural industrial giants Archer Daniels Midland and Midwest Grain Processors  Bottlers purchase the base spirits in bulk  then filter  dilute  distribute and market the end product under a variety of vodka brand names   3 1  Distilling and filtering  A common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing including the addition of flavorants  Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation  as well as afterwards  where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off flavors to the vodka  However  this is not the case in the traditional vodka producing nations  so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering  thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products   The master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration  which includes the removal of the  fore shots    heads  and  tails   These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate  heads  as well as the fusel oils  tails  that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka  Through numerous rounds of distillation  or the use of a fractioning still  the taste is modified and clarity is increased  In contrast  distillery process for liquors such as whiskey  rum  and baijiu allow portions of the  heads  and  tails  to remain  giving them their unique flavors   Repeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users  whether legislation determines strength limits or not  Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster  the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95–96% ethanol  As such  most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling   Polish distilleries make a very pure  96%  192 proof  formerly also 98%  rectified spirit  Polish language  spirytus rektyfikowany   Technically a form of vodka  it is sold in liquor stores rather than pharmacies  Similarly  the German market often carries German  Hungarian  Polish  and Ukrainian made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95% ABV  A Bulgarian vodka  Balkan 176°  has an 88% alcohol content  Everclear  an American brand  is also sold at 95% ABV   3 2  Flavoring  While most vodkas are unflavored  many flavored vodkas have been produced in traditional vodka drinking areas  often as home made recipes to improve vodka s taste or for medicinal purposes  Flavorings include red pepper  ginger  fruit flavors  vanilla  chocolate  without sweetener   and cinnamon  In Russia  vodka flavored with honey and pepper  pertsovka in Russian  is also very popular  In Poland and Belarus  the leaves of the local bison grass are added to produce zubrówka  Polish  and zubrovka  Belarusian  vodka  with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors  In Lithuania and Poland  a famous vodka containing honey is called krupnik   This tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the Nordic countries  where vodka seasoned with herbs  fruits and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities  Sweden has forty odd common varieties of herb flavored vodka  kryddat brännvin   In Poland and Ukraine  a separate category  nalyvka in Ukraine and nalewka in Poland  is used for vodka based spirits with fruit  root  flower  or herb extracts  which are often home made or produced by small commercial distilleries  Their alcohol contents vary between 15 and 75%  In Estonia  vodkas are spiced with barbaris  blackcurrant  cherry  green apple  lemon  vanilla and watermelon flavors   More recently  people have experimented with producing more unusual flavors of vodka  such as very hot chili flavored vodka and even bacon vodka   4  Today  According to The Penguin Book of Spirits and Liqueurs   Its low level of fusel oils and congeners—impurities that flavour spirits but that can contribute to the after effects of heavy consumption—led to its being considered among the  safer  spirits  though not in terms of its powers of intoxication  which  depending on strength  may be considerable    Since the year 2000  due to evolving consumer tastes and regulatory changes  a number of  artisanal vodka  or even  ultrapremium vodka  brands have appeared   4 1  European Union regulation  The recent success of grape based vodka in the United States prompted traditional vodka producers in the Vodka Belt countries of Poland  Finland  Estonia  Lithuania  and Sweden to campaign for EU legislation that will categorize only spirits made from grain or potatoes as  vodka   This proposition provoked heavy criticism from south European countries  which often distill used mash from wine making into spirits  although higher quality mash is usually distilled into some variety of pomace brandy  lower quality mash is better turned into neutral flavored spirits instead  Any vodka not made from either grain or potatoes would have to display the products used in its production  This regulation entered into force in 2008   5  Health  In some countries  black market or  bathtub  vodka is widespread because it can be produced easily and avoid taxation  However  severe poisoning  blindness  or death can occur as a result of dangerous industrial ethanol substitutes being added by black market producers  In March 2007 in a documentary  BBC News UK sought to find the cause of severe jaundice among imbibers of a  bathtub  vodka in Russia  The cause was suspected to be an industrial disinfectant  Extrasept  – 95% ethanol but also containing a highly toxic chemical – added to the vodka by the illegal traders because of its high alcohol content and low price  Death toll estimates list at least 120 dead and more than 1 000 poisoned  The death toll is expected to rise due to the chronic nature of the cirrhosis that is causing the jaundice  However  there are also much higher estimates of the annual death toll  dozens or even hundreds of thousand of lives  produced by the vodka consumption in Russia   6  See also  List of cocktails with vodka
