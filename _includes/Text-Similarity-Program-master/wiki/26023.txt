In telecommunications  RS 232 is a standard for serial communication transmission of data  It formally defines the signals connecting between a DTE  data terminal equipment  such as a computer terminal  and a DCE  data circuit terminating equipment  originally defined as data communication equipment   such as a modem  The RS 232 standard is commonly used in computer serial ports  The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals  the meaning of signals  and the physical size and pinout of connectors  The current version of the standard is TIA 232 F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange  issued in 1997   An RS 232 serial port was once a standard feature of a personal computer  used for connections to modems  printers  mice  data storage  uninterruptible power supplies  and other peripheral devices  However  RS 232 is hampered by low transmission speed  large voltage swing  and large standard connectors  In modern personal computers  USB has displaced RS 232 from most of its peripheral interface roles  Many computers do not come equipped with RS 232 ports and must use either an external USB to RS 232 converter or an internal expansion card with one or more serial ports to connect to RS 232 peripherals  RS 232 devices are widely used  especially in industrial machines  networking equipment and scientific instruments   1  Scope of the standard  The Electronic Industries Association  EIA  standard RS 232 C as of 1969 defines   Electrical signal characteristics such as voltage levels  signaling rate  timing and slew rate of signals  voltage withstand level  short circuit behavior  and maximum load capacitance   Interface mechanical characteristics  pluggable connectors and pin identification   Functions of each circuit in the interface connector   Standard subsets of interface circuits for selected telecom applications  The standard does not define such elements as the character encoding or the framing of characters  or error detection protocols  The character format and transmission bit rate are set by the serial port hardware which may also contain circuits to convert the internal logic levels to RS 232 compatible signal levels  The standard does not define bit rates for transmission  except that it says it is intended for bit rates lower than 20 000 bits per second   2  History  RS 232 was first introduced in 1962 by the Radio Sector of the EIA  The original DTEs were electromechanical teletypewriters  and the original DCEs were  usually  modems  When electronic terminals  smart and dumb  began to be used  they were often designed to be interchangeable with teletypewriters  and so supported RS 232  The C revision of the standard was issued in 1969 in part to accommodate the electrical characteristics of these devices   Since the requirements of devices such as computers  printers  test instruments  POS terminals and so on were not foreseen by the standard  designers implementing an RS 232 compatible interface on their equipment often interpreted the standard idiosyncratically  The resulting common problems were non standard pin assignment of circuits on connectors  and incorrect or missing control signals  The lack of adherence to the standards produced a thriving industry of breakout boxes  patch boxes  test equipment  books  and other aids for the connection of disparate equipment  A common deviation from the standard was to drive the signals at a reduced voltage  Some manufacturers therefore built transmitters that supplied +5 V and  5 V and labeled them as  RS 232 compatible    Later personal computers  and other devices  started to make use of the standard so that they could connect to existing equipment  For many years  an RS 232 compatible port was a standard feature for serial communications  such as modem connections  on many computers  It remained in widespread use into the late 1990s  In personal computer peripherals  it has largely been supplanted by other interface standards  such as USB  RS 232 is still used to connect older designs of peripherals  industrial equipment  such as PLCs   console ports and special purpose equipment   The standard has been renamed several times during its history as the sponsoring organization changed its name  and has been variously known as EIA RS 232  EIA 232  and most recently as TIA 232  The standard continued to be revised and updated by the Electronic Industries Alliance and since 1988 by the Telecommunications Industry Association  TIA   Revision C was issued in a document dated August 1969  Revision D was issued in 1986  The current revision is TIA 232 F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange  issued in 1997  Changes since Revision C have been in timing and details intended to improve harmonization with the CCITT standard V 24  but equipment built to the current standard will interoperate with older versions   Related ITU T standards include V 24  circuit identification  and V 28  signal voltage and timing characteristics    In revision D of EIA 232  the D subminiature connector was formally included as part of the standard  it was only referenced in the appendix of RS 232 C   The voltage range was extended to +   25 volts  and the circuit capacitance limit was expressly stated as 2500 pF  Revision E of EIA 232 introduced a new  smaller  standard D shell 26 pin  Alt A  connector  and made other changes to improve compatibility with CCITT standards V 24  V 28 and ISO 2110   3  Limitations of the standard  Because RS 232 is used beyond the original purpose of interconnecting a terminal with a modem  successor standards have been developed to address the limitations  Issues with the RS 232 standard include   The large voltage swings and requirement for positive and negative supplies increases power consumption of the interface and complicates power supply design  The voltage swing requirement also limits the upper speed of a compatible interface   Single ended signaling referred to a common signal ground limits the noise immunity and transmission distance   Multi drop connection among more than two devices is not defined  While multi drop  work arounds  have been devised  they have limitations in speed and compatibility   Asymmetrical definitions of the two ends of the link make the assignment of the role of a newly developed device problematic  the designer must decide on either a DTE like or DCE like interface and which connector pin assignments to use   The handshaking and control lines of the interface are intended for the setup and takedown of a dial up communication circuit  in particular  the use of handshake lines for flow control is not reliably implemented in many devices   No method is specified for sending power to a device  While a small amount of current can be extracted from the DTR and RTS lines  this is only suitable for low power devices such as mice   The 25 way connector recommended in the standard is large compared to current practice   The standard does not address the possibility of connecting a DTE directly to a DTE  or a DCE to a DCE   4  Role in modern personal computers  In the book PC 97 Hardware Design Guide  Microsoft deprecated support for the RS 232 compatible serial port of the original IBM PC design  Today  RS 232 has mostly been replaced in personal computers by USB for local communications  Compared with RS 232  USB is faster  uses lower voltages  and has connectors that are simpler to connect and use  However  USB is limited by standard to no more than 5 meters of cable  thus favoring RS 232 when longer distances are needed  Both standards have software support in popular operating systems   USB is designed to make it easy for device drivers to communicate with hardware  USB is more complex than the RS 232 standard because it includes a protocol for transferring data to devices  This requires more software to support the protocol used  There is no direct analog to the terminal programs used to let users communicate directly with serial ports   Serial ports of personal computers are also sometimes used to directly control various hardware devices  such as relays or lamps  Personal computers may use a serial port to interface to devices such as uninterruptible power supplies  In some cases  serial data is not exchanged  but the control lines are used to signal conditions such as loss of power or low battery alarms  An application program can detect or change the state of RS 232 control lines in the registers of the serial hardware using only a few input output instructions  by contrast  a USB interface requires software to decode the serial data   Devices that convert between USB and RS 232 do not work with all software or on all personal computers   In fields such as laboratory automation or surveying  RS 232 devices may continue to be used  PLCs  VFDs  servo drives  and CNC equipment are programmable via RS 232  Some manufacturers have responded to this demand  Toshiba re introduced the DE 9M connector on the Tecra laptop   Serial ports with RS 232 are also commonly used to communicate to headless systems such as servers  where no monitor or keyboard is installed  during boot when operating system is not running yet and therefore no network connection is possible  An RS 232 serial port can communicate to some embedded systems such as routers as an alternative to network mode of monitoring   5  Standard details  In RS 232  user data is sent as a time series of bits  Both synchronous and asynchronous transmissions are supported by the standard  In addition to the data circuits  the standard defines a number of control circuits used to manage the connection between the DTE and DCE  Each data or control circuit only operates in one direction  that is  signaling from a DTE to the attached DCE or the reverse  Since transmit data and receive data are separate circuits  the interface can operate in a full duplex manner  supporting concurrent data flow in both directions  The standard does not define character framing within the data stream  or character encoding   5 1  Voltage levels  The RS 232 standard defines the voltage levels that correspond to logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines  Valid signals are either in the range of +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the ground common pin  consequently  the range between −3 to +3 volts is not a valid RS 232 level  For data transmission lines  TxD  RxD and their secondary channel equivalents  logic one is defined as a negative voltage  the signal condition is called  mark   Logic zero is positive and the signal condition is termed  space   Control signals have the opposite polarity  the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the deasserted or inactive state is negative voltage  Examples of control lines include request to send  RTS   clear to send  CTS   data terminal ready  DTR   and data set ready  DSR    The standard specifies a maximum open circuit voltage of 25 volts  signal levels of ±5 V  ±10 V  ±12 V  and ±15 V are all commonly seen depending on the voltages available to the line driver circuit  Some RS 232 driver chips have inbuilt circuitry to produce the required voltages from a 3 or 5 volt supply  RS 232 drivers and receivers must be able to withstand indefinite short circuit to ground or to any voltage level up to ±25 volts  The slew rate  or how fast the signal changes between levels  is also controlled   Because the voltage levels are higher than logic levels typically used by integrated circuits  special intervening driver circuits are required to translate logic levels  These also protect the device s internal circuitry from short circuits or transients that may appear on the RS 232 interface  and provide sufficient current to comply with the slew rate requirements for data transmission   Because both ends of the RS 232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts  problems will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the ground pin on one end  and the ground pin on the other is not zero  This may also cause a hazardous ground loop  Use of a common ground limits RS 232 to applications with relatively short cables  If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems  the local ground connections at either end of the cable will have differing voltages  this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals  Balanced  differential  serial connections such as USB  RS 422 and RS 485 can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling   Unused interface signals terminated to ground will have an undefined logic state  Where it is necessary to permanently set a control signal to a defined state  it must be connected to a voltage source that asserts the logic 1 or logic 0 level  for example with a pullup resistor  Some devices provide test voltages on their interface connectors for this purpose   5 2  Connectors  RS 232 devices may be classified as Data Terminal Equipment  DTE  or Data Communication Equipment  DCE   this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal  The standard recommended but did not make mandatory the D subminiature 25 pin connector  According to the standard  male connectors have DTE pin functions  and female connectors have DCE pin functions  Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions  Many terminals were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end  the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard  The standard specifies 20 different signal connections  Since most devices use only a few signals  smaller connectors can often be used   Personal computer manufacturers replaced the DB 25M connector by the smaller DE 9M connector  Different pin numbers were used for the signals  for this see serial port   This connector  with varying pinouts  became common for personal computers and related devices   Presence of a 25 pin D sub connector does not necessarily indicate an RS 232 C compliant interface  For example  on the original IBM PC  a male D sub was an RS 232 C DTE port  with a non standard current loop interface on reserved pins   but the female D sub connector on the same PC model was used for the parallel Centronics printer port  Some personal computers put non standard voltages or signals on some pins of their serial ports   5 3  Signals  The following table lists commonly used RS 232 signals and pin assignments  See serial port  pinouts  for non standard variations including the popular DE 9 connector   The signals are named from the standpoint of the DTE  The ground signal is a common return for the other connections  The DB 25 connector includes a second  protective ground  on pin 1   Data can be sent over a secondary channel  when implemented by the DTE and DCE devices   which is equivalent to the primary channel  Pin assignments are described in following table   Ring Indicator   RI   is a signal sent from the modem to the terminal device  It indicates to the terminal device that the phone line is ringing  In many computer serial ports  a hardware interrupt is generated when the RI signal changes state  Having support for this hardware interrupt means that a program or operating system can be informed of a change in state of the RI pin  without requiring the software to constantly  poll  the state of the pin  RI is a one way signal from the modem to the terminal  or more generally  the DCE to the DTE  that does not correspond to another signal that carries similar information the opposite way   On an external modem the status of the Ring Indicator pin is often coupled to the  AA   auto answer  light  which flashes if the RI signal has detected a ring  The asserted RI signal follows the ringing pattern closely  which can permit software to detect distinctive ring patterns   The Ring Indicator signal is used by some older uninterruptible power supplies  UPS s  to signal a power failure state to the computer   Certain personal computers can be configured for wake on ring  allowing a computer that is suspended to answer a phone call   5 4  Cables  The standard does not define a maximum cable length but instead defines the maximum capacitance that a compliant drive circuit must tolerate  A widely used rule of thumb indicates that cables more than long will have too much capacitance  unless special cables are used  By using low capacitance cables  full speed communication can be maintained over larger distances up to about   For longer distances  other signal standards are better suited to maintain high speed   Since the standard definitions are not always correctly applied  it is often necessary to consult documentation  test connections with a breakout box  or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices  Connecting a fully standard compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector  a so called  straight cable     Gender changers  are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors  Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins according to the table above  Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common  Manufacturers of equipment with 8P8C connectors usually provide a cable with either a DB 25 or DE 9 connector  or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices   Poor quality cables can cause false signals by crosstalk between data and control lines  such as Ring Indicator    If a given cable will not allow a data connection  especially if a gender changer is in use  a null modem cable may be necessary  Gender changers and null modem cables are not mentioned in the standard  so there is no officially sanctioned design for them   6  Conventions  For functional communication through a serial port interface  conventions of bit rate  character framing  communications protocol  character encoding  data compression  and error detection  not defined in RS 232  must be agreed to by both sending and receiving equipment  For example  consider the serial ports of the original IBM PC  This implementation used an 8250 UART using asynchronous start stop character formatting with 7 or 8 data bits per frame  usually ASCII character coding  and data rates programmable between 75 bits per second and 115 200 bits per second  Data rates above 20 000 bits per second are out of the scope of the standard  although higher data rates are sometimes used by commercially manufactured equipment  Since most RS 232 devices do not have automatic baud rate detection  users must manually set the baud rate  and all other parameters  at both ends of the RS 232 connection   In the particular case of the 8250 UART used by the IBM PC and others  baud rates were programmable by writing integer values to a divider register and by selecting one of several clock prescalers for the divider  This allowed a PC to be connected to devices using rates other than those standardized for modems  Not all baud rates can be programmed  due to the clock frequency of the 8250 UART in the PC  and the granularity of the baud rate setting  This includes the baud rate of MIDI  31 250 bits per second  which is not achievable by a standard IBM PC serial port  MIDI to RS 232 interfaces designed for the IBM PC include baud rate translation hardware to adjust the baud rate of the MIDI data to something that the IBM PC can support  for example 19 200 or 38 400 bits per second   6 1  RTS CTS handshaking  In older versions of the specification  RS 232 s use of the RTS and CTS lines is asymmetric  The DTE asserts RTS to indicate a desire to transmit to the DCE  and the DCE asserts CTS in response to grant permission  This allows for half duplex modems that disable their transmitters when not required  and must transmit a synchronization preamble to the receiver when they are re enabled  This scheme is also employed on present day RS 232 to RS 485 converters  where the RS 232 s RTS signal is used to ask the converter to take control of the RS 485 bus—a concept that does not otherwise exist in RS 232  There is no way for the DTE to indicate that it is unable to accept data from the DCE   A non standard symmetric alternative  commonly called  RTS CTS handshaking   was developed by various equipment manufacturers  In this scheme  CTS is no longer a response to RTS  instead  CTS indicates permission from the DCE for the DTE to send data to the DCE  and RTS indicates permission from the DTE for the DCE to send data to the DTE  RTS and CTS are controlled by the DTE and DCE respectively  each independent of the other  This was eventually codified in version RS 232 E  actually TIA 232 E by that time  by defining a new signal   RTR  Ready to Receive    which is CCITT V 24 circuit 133  TIA 232 E and the corresponding international standards were updated to show that circuit 133  when implemented  shares the same pin as RTS  Request to Send   and that when 133 is in use  RTS is assumed by the DCE to be ON at all times   Thus  with this alternative usage  one can think of RTS asserted  positive voltage  logic 0  meaning that the DTE is indicating it is  ready to receive  from the DCE  rather than requesting permission from the DCE to send characters to the DCE   Note that equipment using this protocol must be prepared to buffer some extra data  since a transmission may have begun just before the control line state change   RTS CTS handshaking is an example of hardware flow control  However   hardware flow control  in the description of the options available on an RS 232 equipped device does not always mean RTS CTS handshaking   6 2  3 wire and 5 wire RS 232  A minimal  3 wire  RS 232 connection consisting only of transmit data  receive data  and ground  is commonly used when the full facilities of RS 232 are not required  Even a two wire connection  data and ground  can be used if the data flow is one way  for example  a digital postal scale that periodically sends a weight reading  or a GPS receiver that periodically sends position  if no configuration via RS 232 is necessary   When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two way data  the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5 wire version   7  Seldom used features  The EIA 232 standard specifies connections for several features that are not used in most implementations  Their use requires 25 pin connectors and cables   7 1  Signal rate selection  The DTE or DCE can specify use of a  high  or  low  signaling rate  The rates as well as which device will select the rate must be configured in both the DTE and DCE  The prearranged device selects the high rate by setting pin 23 to ON   7 2  Loopback testing  Many DCE devices have a loopback capability used for testing  When enabled  signals are echoed back to the sender rather than being sent on to the receiver  If supported  the DTE can signal the local DCE  the one it is connected to  to enter loopback mode by setting pin 18 to ON  or the remote DCE  the one the local DCE is connected to  to enter loopback mode by setting pin 21 to ON  The latter tests the communications link as well as both DCE s  When the DCE is in test mode it signals the DTE by setting pin 25 to ON   A commonly used version of loopback testing does not involve any special capability of either end  A hardware loopback is simply a wire connecting complementary pins together in the same connector  see loopback    Loopback testing is often performed with a specialized DTE called a bit error rate tester  or BERT    7 3  Timing signals  Some synchronous devices provide a clock signal to synchronize data transmission  especially at higher data rates  Two timing signals are provided by the DCE on pins 15 and 17  Pin 15 is the transmitter clock  or send timing  ST   the DTE puts the next bit on the data line  pin 2  when this clock transitions from OFF to ON  so it is stable during the ON to OFF transition when the DCE registers the bit   Pin 17 is the receiver clock  or receive timing  RT   the DTE reads the next bit from the data line  pin 3  when this clock transitions from ON to OFF   Alternatively  the DTE can provide a clock signal  called transmitter timing  TT   on pin 24 for transmitted data  Data is changed when the clock transitions from OFF to ON and read during the ON to OFF transition  TT can be used to overcome the issue where ST must traverse a cable of unknown length and delay  clock a bit out of the DTE after another unknown delay  and return it to the DCE over the same unknown cable delay  Since the relation between the transmitted bit and TT can be fixed in the DTE design  and since both signals traverse the same cable length  using TT eliminates the issue  TT may be generated by looping ST back with an appropriate phase change to align it with the transmitted data  ST loop back to TT lets the DTE use the DCE as the frequency reference  and correct the clock to data timing   Synchronous clocking is required for such protocols as SDLC  HDLC  and X 25   7 4  Secondary channel  There is a secondary data channel  identical in capability to the first  Five signals  plus the common ground of the primary channel  comprise the secondary channel  Secondary Transmitted Data  STD   Secondary Received Data  SRD   Secondary Request To Send  SRTS   Secondary Clear To Send  SCTS   and Secondary Carrier Detect  SDCD    8  Related standards  Other serial signaling standards may not interoperate with standard compliant RS 232 ports  For example  using the TTL levels of near +5 and 0 V puts the mark level in the undefined area of the standard  Such levels are sometimes used with GPS receivers and depth finders   A 20 mA current loop uses the absence of 20 mA current for high  and the presence of current in the loop for low  this signaling method is often used for long distance and optically isolated links  Connection of a current loop device to a compliant RS 232 port requires a level translator  Current loop devices can supply voltages in excess of the withstand voltage limits of a compliant device  The original IBM PC serial port card implemented a 20 mA current loop interface  which was never emulated by other suppliers of plug compatible equipment   Other serial interfaces similar to RS 232   RS 422  a high speed system similar to RS 232 but with differential signaling   RS 423  a high speed system similar to RS 422 but with unbalanced signaling   RS 449  a functional and mechanical interface that used RS 422 and RS 423 signals   it never caught on like RS 232 and was withdrawn by the EIA   RS 485  a descendant of RS 422 that can be used as a bus in multidrop configurations   MIL STD 188  a system like RS 232 but with better impedance and rise time control   EIA 530  a high speed system using RS 422 or RS 423 electrical properties in an EIA 232 pinout configuration  thus combining the best of both  supersedes RS 449   EIA TIA 561 8 Position Non Synchronous Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange  EIA TIA 562 Electrical Characteristics for an Unbalanced Digital Interface  low voltage version of EIA TIA 232   TIA 574  standardizes the 9 pin D subminiature connector pinout for use with EIA 232 electrical signalling  as originated on the IBM PC AT   9  Development tools  When developing or troubleshooting systems using RS 232  close examination of hardware signals can be important to find problems  A serial line analyzer is a device similar to a logic analyzer but specialized for RS 232 s voltage levels  connectors  and  where used  clock signals  The serial line analyzer can collect  store  and display the data and control signals  allowing developers to view them in detail  Some simply display the signals as waveforms  more elaborate versions include the ability to decode characters in ASCII or other common codes and to interpret common protocols used over RS 232 such as SDLC  HDLC  DDCMP  and X 25  Serial line analyzers are available as standalone units  as software and interface cables for general purpose logic analyzers and oscilloscopes  and as programs that run on common personal computers and devices   10  References  11  Further reading  Serial Port Complete  COM Ports  USB Virtual
