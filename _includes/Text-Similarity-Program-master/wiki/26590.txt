A relay is an electrically operated switch  Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch  but other operating principles are also used  such as solid state relays  Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low power signal  with complete electrical isolation between control and controlled circuits   or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal  The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers  they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re transmitted it on another circuit  Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations   A type of relay that can handle the high power required to directly control an electric motor or other loads is called a contactor  Solid state relays control power circuits with no moving parts  instead using a semiconductor device to perform switching  Relays with calibrated operating characteristics and sometimes multiple operating coils are used to protect electrical circuits from overload or faults  in modern electric power systems these functions are performed by digital instruments still called  protective relays    1  Basic design and operation  A simple electromagnetic relay consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core  an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux  a movable iron armature  and one or more sets of contacts  there are two in the relay pictured   The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked to one or more sets of moving contacts  It is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit  In this condition  one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed  and the other set is open  Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function  The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke  This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature  and the circuit track on the printed circuit board  PCB  via the yoke  which is soldered to the PCB   When an electric current is passed through the coil it generates a magnetic field that activates the armature  and the consequent movement of the movable contact s  either makes or breaks  depending upon construction  a connection with a fixed contact  If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de energized  then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection  and vice versa if the contacts were open  When the current to the coil is switched off  the armature is returned by a force  approximately half as strong as the magnetic force  to its relaxed position  Usually this force is provided by a spring  but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor starters  Most relays are manufactured to operate quickly  In a low voltage application this reduces noise  in a high voltage or current application it reduces arcing   When the coil is energized with direct current  a diode is often placed across the coil to dissipate the energy from the collapsing magnetic field at deactivation  which would otherwise generate a voltage spike dangerous to semiconductor circuit components  Some automotive relays include a diode inside the relay case  Alternatively  a contact protection network consisting of a capacitor and resistor in series  snubber circuit  may absorb the surge  If the coil is designed to be energized with alternating current  AC   a small copper  shading ring  can be crimped to the end of the solenoid  creating a small out of phase current which increases the minimum pull on the armature during the AC cycle   2  Types  2 1  Latching relay  A latching relay  also called  impulse    keep   or  stay  relays  maintains either contact position indefinitely without power applied to the coil  The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched  and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage  A latching relay allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously  AC  energized coil   In one mechanism  two opposing coils with an over center spring or permanent magnet hold the contacts in position after the coil is de energized  A pulse to one coil turns the relay on and a pulse to the opposite coil turns the relay off  This type is widely used where control is from simple switches or single ended outputs of a control system  and such relays are found in avionics and numerous industrial applications   Another latching type has a remanent core that retains the contacts in the operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core  This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts  A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact  the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet  A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an H bridge drive circuit to control it  The relay may be less expensive than other types  but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit   In another type  a ratchet relay has a ratchet mechanism that holds the contacts closed after the coil is momentarily energized  A second impulse  in the same or a separate coil  releases the contacts  This type may be found in certain cars  for headlamp dipping and other functions where alternating operation on each switch actuation is needed   A stepping relay is a specialized kind of multi way latching relay designed for early automatic telephone exchanges   An earth leakage circuit breaker includes a specialized latching relay   Very early computers often stored bits in a magnetically latching relay  such as ferreed or the later memreed in the 1ESS switch   Some early computers used ordinary relays as a kind of latch—they store bits in ordinary wire spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input  resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit  Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state  unlike magnetically latching relays or mechanically racheting relays   In computer memories  latching relays and other relays were replaced by delay line memory  which in turn was replaced by a series of ever faster and ever smaller memory technologies   2 2  Reed relay  A reed relay is a reed switch enclosed in a solenoid  The switch has a set of contacts inside an evacuated or inert gas filled glass tube which protects the contacts against atmospheric corrosion  the contacts are made of magnetic material that makes them move under the influence of the field of the enclosing solenoid or an external magnet   Reed relays can switch faster than larger relays and require very little power from the control circuit  However  they have relatively low switching current and voltage ratings  Though rare  the reeds can become magnetized over time  which makes them stick  on  even when no current is present  changing the orientation of the reeds with respect to the solenoid s magnetic field can resolve this problem   Sealed contacts with mercury wetted contacts have longer operating lives and less contact chatter than any other kind of relay   2 3  Mercury wetted relay  A mercury wetted reed relay is a form of reed relay in which the contacts are wetted with mercury  Such relays are used to switch low voltage signals  one volt or less  where the mercury reduces the contact resistance and associated voltage drop  for low current signals where surface contamination may make for a poor contact  or for high speed applications where the mercury eliminates contact bounce  Mercury wetted relays are position sensitive and must be mounted vertically to work properly  Because of the toxicity and expense of liquid mercury  these relays are now rarely used   The mercury wetted relay has one particular advantage  in that the contact closure appears to be virtually instantaneous  as the mercury globules on each contact coalesce  The current rise time through the contacts is generally considered to be a few picoseconds  however in a practical circuit it will be limited by the inductance of the contacts and wiring  It was quite common  before the restrictions on the use of mercury  to use a mercury wetted relay in the laboratory as a convenient means of generating fast rise time pulses  however although the rise time may be picoseconds  the exact timing of the event is  like all other types of relay  subject to considerable jitter  possibly milliseconds  due to mechanical imperfections   The same coalescence process causes another effect  which is a nuisance in some applications  The contact resistance is not stable immediately after contact closure  and drifts  mostly downwards  for several seconds after closure  the change perhaps being 0 5 ohm   2 4  Mercury relay  A mercury relay is a relay that uses mercury as the switching element  They are used where contact erosion would be a problem for conventional relay contacts  Owing to environmental considerations about significant amount of mercury used and modern alternatives  they are now comparatively uncommon   2 5  Polarized relay  A polarized relay places the armature between the poles of a permanent magnet to increase sensitivity  Polarized relays were used in middle 20th Century telephone exchanges to detect faint pulses and correct telegraphic distortion  The poles were on screws  so a technician could first adjust them for maximum sensitivity and then apply a bias spring to set the critical current that would operate the relay   2 6  Machine tool relay  A machine tool relay is a type standardized for industrial control of machine tools  transfer machines  and other sequential control  They are characterized by a large number of contacts  sometimes extendable in the field  which are easily converted from normally open to normally closed status  easily replaceable coils  and a form factor that allows compactly installing many relays in a control panel  Although such relays once were the backbone of automation in such industries as automobile assembly  the programmable logic controller  PLC  mostly displaced the machine tool relay from sequential control applications   A relay allows circuits to be switched by electrical equipment  for example  a timer circuit with a relay could switch power at a preset time  For many years relays were the standard method of controlling industrial electronic systems  A number of relays could be used together to carry out complex functions  relay logic   The principle of relay logic is based on relays which energize and de energize associated contacts  Relay logic is the predecessor of ladder logic  which is commonly used in programmable logic controllers   2 7  Coaxial relay  Where radio transmitters and receivers share a common antenna  often a coaxial relay is used as a TR  transmit receive  relay  which switches the antenna from the receiver to the transmitter  This protects the receiver from the high power of the transmitter  Such relays are often used in transceivers which combine transmitter and receiver in one unit  The relay contacts are designed not to reflect any radio frequency power back toward the source  and to provide very high isolation between receiver and transmitter terminals  The characteristic impedance of the relay is matched to the transmission line impedance of the system  for example  50 ohms   2 8  Time delay  Timing relays are arranged for an intentional delay in operating their contacts  A very short  a fraction of a second  delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly  Current flowing in the disk maintains magnetic field for a short time  lengthening release time  For a slightly longer  up to a minute  delay  a dashpot is used  A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly  both air filled and oil filled dashpots are used  The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate  For longer time periods  a mechanical clockwork timer is installed  Relays may be arranged for a fixed timing period  or may be field adjustable  or remotely set from a control panel  Modern microprocessor based timing relays provide precision timing over a great range   2 9  Contactor  A contactor is a heavy duty relay used for switching electric motors and lighting loads  but contactors are not generally called relays  Continuous current ratings for common contactors range from 10 amps to several hundred amps  High current contacts are made with alloys containing silver  The unavoidable arcing causes the contacts to oxidize  however  silver oxide is still a good conductor  Contactors with overload protection devices are often used to start motors  Contactors can make loud sounds when they operate  so they may be unfit for use where noise is a chief concern   A contactor is an electrically controlled switch used for switching a power circuit  similar to a relay except with higher current ratings  A contactor is controlled by a circuit which has a much lower power level than the switched circuit   Contactors come in many forms with varying capacities and features  Unlike a circuit breaker  a contactor is not intended to interrupt a short circuit current  Contactors range from those having a breaking current of several amperes to thousands of amperes and 24 V DC to many kilovolts  The physical size of contactors ranges from a device small enough to pick up with one hand  to large devices approximately a meter  yard  on a side   2 10  Solid state relay  A solid state relay or SSR is a solid state electronic component that provides a similar function to an electromechanical relay but does not have any moving components  increasing long term reliability  A solid state relay uses a thyristor  TRIAC or other solid state switching device  activated by the control signal  to switch the controlled load  instead of a solenoid  An optocoupler  a light emitting diode  LED  coupled with a photo transistor  can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits   As every solid state device has a small voltage drop across it  this voltage drop limits the amount of current a given SSR can handle  The minimum voltage drop for such a relay is a function of the material used to make the device  Solid state relays rated to handle as much as 1 200 amperes have become commercially available  Compared to electromagnetic relays  they may be falsely triggered by transients and in general may be susceptible to damage by extreme cosmic ray and EMP episodes   2 11  Solid state contactor relay  A solid state contactor is a heavy duty solid state relay  including the necessary heat sink  used where frequent on off cycles are required  such as with electric heaters  small electric motors  and lighting loads  There are no moving parts to wear out and there is no contact bounce due to vibration  They are activated by AC control signals or DC control signals from Programmable logic controller  PLCs   PCs  Transistor transistor logic  TTL  sources  or other microprocessor and microcontroller controls   2 12  Buchholz relay  A Buchholz relay is a safety device sensing the accumulation of gas in large oil filled transformers  which will alarm on slow accumulation of gas or shut down the transformer if gas is produced rapidly in the transformer oil  The contacts are not operated by an electric current but by the pressure of accumulated gas or oil flow   2 13  Forced guided contacts relay  A forced guided contacts relay has relay contacts that are mechanically linked together  so that when the relay coil is energized or de energized  all of the linked contacts move together  If one set of contacts in the relay becomes immobilized  no other contact of the same relay will be able to move  The function of forced guided contacts is to enable the safety circuit to check the status of the relay  Forced guided contacts are also known as  positive guided contacts    captive contacts    locked contacts    mechanically linked contacts   or  safety relays    These safety relays have to follow design rules and manufacturing rules that are defined in one main machinery standard EN 50205   Relays with forcibly guided  mechanically linked  contacts  These rules for the safety design are the one that are defined in type B standards such as EN 13848 2 as Basic safety principles and Well tried safety principles for machinery that applies to all machines   Forced guided contacts by themselves can not guarantee that all contacts are in the same state  however they do guarantee  subject to no gross mechanical fault  that no contacts are in opposite states  Otherwise  a relay with several normally open  NO  contacts may stick when energised  with some contacts closed and others still slightly open  due to mechanical tolerances  Similarly  a relay with several normally closed  NC  contacts may stick to the unenergised position  so that when energised  the circuit through one set of contacts is broken  with a marginal gap  while the other remains closed  By introducing both NO and NC contacts  or more commonly  changeover contacts  on the same relay  it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC contact is closed  all NO contacts are open  and conversely  if any NO contact is closed  all NC contacts are open  It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed  except by potentially intrusive and safety degrading sensing of its circuit conditions  however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important  and as explained above  this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense   Forced guided contact relays are made with different main contact sets  either NO  NC or changeover  and one or more auxiliary contact sets  often of reduced current or voltage rating  used for the monitoring system  Contacts may be all NO  all NC  changeover  or a mixture of these  for the monitoring contacts  so that the safety system designer can select the correct configuration for the particular application  Safety relays are used as part of an engineered safety system   2 14  Overload protection relay  Electric motors need overcurrent protection to prevent damage from over loading the motor  or to protect against short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings  The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a bimetallic strip  or where a solder pot melts  releasing a spring to operate auxiliary contacts  These auxiliary contacts are in series with the coil  If the overload senses excess current in the load  the coil is de energized   This thermal protection operates relatively slowly allowing the motor to draw higher starting currents before the protection relay will trip  Where the overload relay is exposed to the same environment as the motor  a useful though crude compensation for motor ambient temperature is provided   The other common overload protection system uses an electromagnet coil in series with the motor circuit that directly operates contacts  This is similar to a control relay but requires a rather high fault current to operate the contacts  To prevent short over current spikes from causing nuisance triggering the armature movement is damped with a dashpot  The thermal and magnetic overload detections are typically used together in a motor protection relay   Electronic overload protection relays measure motor current and can estimate motor winding temperature using a  thermal model  of the motor armature system that can be set to provide more accurate motor protection  Some motor protection relays include temperature detector inputs for direct measurement from a thermocouple or resistance thermometer sensor embedded in the winding   2 15  Vacuum relays  A sensitive relay having its contacts mounted in a highly evacuated glass housing  to permit handling radio frequency voltages as high as 20 000 volts without flashover between contacts even though contact spacing is but a few hundredths of an inch when open   3  Pole and throw  Since relays are switches  the terminology applied to switches is also applied to relays  a relay switches one or more poles  each of whose contacts can be thrown by energizing the coil   Normally open  NO  contacts connect the circuit when the relay is activated  the circuit is disconnected when the relay is inactive  It is also called a  Form A  contact or  make  contact  NO contacts may also be distinguished as  early make  or  NOEM   which means that the contacts close before the button or switch is fully engaged   Normally closed  NC  contacts disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated  the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive  It is also called a  Form B  contact or  break  contact  NC contacts may also be distinguished as  late break  or  NCLB   which means that the contacts stay closed until the button or switch is fully disengaged   Change over  CO   or double throw  DT   contacts control two circuits  one normally open contact and one normally closed contact with a common terminal  It is also called a  Form C  contact or  transfer  contact   break before make    If this type of contact has a  make before break  action  then it is called a  Form D  contact   The following designations are commonly encountered   SPST – Single Pole Single Throw  These have two terminals which can be connected or disconnected  Including two for the coil  such a relay has four terminals in total  It is ambiguous whether the pole is normally open or normally closed  The terminology  SPNO  and  SPNC  is sometimes used to resolve the ambiguity   SPDT – Single Pole Double Throw  A common terminal connects to either of two others  Including two for the coil  such a relay has five terminals in total   DPST – Double Pole Single Throw  These have two pairs of terminals  Equivalent to two SPST switches or relays actuated by a single coil  Including two for the coil  such a relay has six terminals in total  The poles may be Form A or Form B  or one of each    DPDT – Double Pole Double Throw  These have two rows of change over terminals  Equivalent to two SPDT switches or relays actuated by a single coil  Such a relay has eight terminals  including the coil  The  S  or  D  may be replaced with a number  indicating multiple switches connected to a single actuator  For example 4PDT indicates a four pole double throw relay  with 12 terminals    EN 50005 are among applicable standards for relay terminal numbering  a typical EN 50005 compliant SPDT relay s terminals would be numbered 11  12  14  A1 and A2 for the C  NC  NO  and coil connections  respectively   DIN 72552 defines contact numbers in relays for automotive use   85   relay coil    86   relay coil +  87   common contact  87a   normally closed contact  87b   normally open contact  4  Applications  Relays are used wherever it is necessary to control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit  The first application of relays was in long telegraph systems  where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact  regenerating the signal for further transmission  High voltage or high current devices can be controlled with small  low voltage wiring and pilots switches  Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit  Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability  In an automobile  a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key   Electromechanical switching systems including Strowger and Crossbar telephone exchanges made extensive use of relays in ancillary control circuits  The Relay Automatic Telephone Company also manufactured telephone exchanges based solely on relay switching techniques designed by Gotthilf Ansgarius Betulander  The first public relay based telephone exchange in the UK was installed in Fleetwood on 15 July 1922 and remained in service until 1959   The use of relays for the logical control of complex switching systems like telephone exchanges was studied by Claude Shannon  who formalized the application of Boolean algebra to relay circuit design in A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits  Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic  For example  the boolean AND function is realised by connecting normally open relay contacts in series  the OR function by connecting normally open contacts in parallel  Inversion of a logical input can be done with a normally closed contact  Relays were used for control of automated systems for machine tools and production lines  The Ladder programming language is often used for designing relay logic networks   Early electro mechanical computers such as the ARRA  Harvard Mark II  Zuse Z2  and Zuse Z3 relays for logic and working registers  However  electronic devices proved faster and easier to use   Because relays are much more resistant than semiconductors to nuclear radiation  they are widely used in safety critical logic  such as the control panels of radioactive waste handling machinery  Electromechanical protective relays are used to detect overload and other faults on electrical lines by opening and closing circuit breakers   5  Relay application considerations  Selection of an appropriate relay for a particular application requires evaluation of many different factors   Number and type of contacts – normally open  normally closed   double throw   Contact sequence –  Make before Break  or  Break before Make   For example  the old style telephone exchanges required Make before break so that the connection didn t get dropped while dialing the number   Rating of contacts – small relays switch a few amperes  large contactors are rated for up to 3000 amperes  alternating or direct current  Voltage rating of contacts – typical control relays rated 300 VAC or 600 VAC  automotive types to 50 VDC  special high voltage relays to about 15 000 V  Operating lifetime  useful life   the number of times the relay can be expected to operate reliably  There is both a mechanical life and a contact life  The contact life is affected by the kind of load being switched  Breaking load current causes undesired arcing between the contacts  eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due erosion by the arc   Coil voltage – machine tool relays usually 24 VDC  120 or 250 VAC  relays for switchgear may have 125 V or 250 VDC coils   sensitive  relays operate on a few milliamperes  Coil current   including minimum current required to operate reliably and minimum current to hold  Also effects of power dissipation on coil temperature at various duty cycles   Package enclosure – open  touch safe  double voltage for isolation between circuits  explosion proof  outdoor  oil and splash resistant  washable for printed circuit board assembly  Operating environment   minimum and maximum operating temperatures and other environmental considerations such as effects of humidity and salt  Assembly – Some relays feature a sticker that keeps the enclosure sealed to allow PCB post soldering cleaning  which is removed once assembly is complete   Mounting – sockets  plug board  rail mount  panel mount  through panel mount  enclosure for mounting on walls or equipment  Switching time – where high speed is required   Dry  contacts – when switching very low level signals  special contact materials may be needed such as gold plated contacts  Contact protection – suppress arcing in very inductive circuits  Coil protection – suppress the surge voltage produced when switching the coil current  Isolation between coil contacts  Aerospace or radiation resistant testing  special quality assurance  Expected mechanical loads due to acceleration – some relays used in aerospace applications are designed to function in shock loads of 50 g or more  Size   smaller relays often resist mechanical vibration and shock better than larger relays  because of the lower inertia of the moving parts and the higher natural frequencies of smaller parts  Larger relays often handle higher voltage and current than smaller relays   Accessories such as timers  auxiliary contacts  pilot lamps  and test buttons  Regulatory approvals  Stray magnetic linkage between coils of adjacent relays on a printed circuit board  There are many considerations involved in the correct selection of a control relay for a particular application  These considerations include factors such as speed of operation  sensitivity  and hysteresis  Although typical control relays operate in the 5 ms to 20 ms range  relays with switching speeds as fast as 100 us are available  Reed relays which are actuated by low currents and switch fast are suitable for controlling small currents   As for any switch  the current through the relay contacts  unrelated to the current through the coil  must not exceed a certain value to avoid damage  In the particular case of high inductance circuits such as motors  other issues must be addressed  When an inductance is connected to a power source  an input surge current or electromotor starting current larger than the steady current exists  When the circuit is broken  the current cannot change instantaneously  which creates a potentially damaging spark across the separating contacts   Consequently for relays which may be used to control inductive loads  we must specify the maximum current that may flow through the relay contacts when it actuates  the make rating  the continuous rating  and the break rating  The make rating may be several times larger than the continuous rating  which is itself larger than the break rating   5 1  Derating factors  Control relays should not be operated above rated temperature because of resulting increased degradation and fatigue  Common practice is to derate 20 degrees Celsius from the maximum rated temperature limit  Relays operating at rated load are also affected by their environment  Oil vapors may greatly decrease the contact tip life  and dust or dirt may cause the tips to burn before their normal life expectancy  Control relay life cycle varies from 50 000 to over one million cycles depending on the electrical loads of the contacts  duty cycle  application  and the extent to which the relay is derated  When a control relay is operating at its derated value  it is controlling a lower value of current than its maximum make and break ratings  This is often done to extend the operating life of the control relay  The table lists the relay derating factors for typical industrial control applications   5 2  Undesired arcing  Switching while  wet   under load  causes undesired arcing between the contacts  eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due to a buildup of contact surface damage caused by the destructive arc energy   Inside the 1ESS switch matrix switch and certain other high reliability designs  the reed switches are always switched  dry  to avoid that problem  leading to much longer contact life   Without adequate contact protection  the occurrence of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts in relays  which suffer significant and visible damage  Every time a relay transitions either from a closed to an open state  break arc  or from an open to a closed state  make arc & bounce arc   under load  an electrical arc can occur between the two contact points  electrodes  of the relay  In many situations  the break arc is more energetic and thus more destructive  in particular with resistive type loads  However  inductive loads can engender more destructive make arcs  for example  with standard electric motors  the start up  inrush  current tends to be much greater than the running current  This translates into enormous make arcs   During an arcing event  the heat energy contained in the electrical arc is very high  tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit   causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt  pool and migrate with the current  The extremely high temperature of the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone  carbon monoxide  and other compounds  The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal  causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter  This very activity causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly  resulting in device failure  This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10 000 to 100 000 operations  a level far below the mechanical life of the same device  which can be in excess of 20 million operations   6  Protective relays  For protection of electrical apparatus and transmission lines  electromechanical relays with accurate operating characteristics were used to detect overload  short circuits  and other faults  While many such relays remain in use  digital devices now provide equivalent protective functions   7  Railway signalling  Railway signalling relays are large considering the mostly small voltages  less than 120 V  and currents  perhaps 100 mA  that they switch  Contacts are widely spaced to prevent flashovers and short circuits over a lifetime that may exceed fifty years  BR930 series plug in relays are widely used on railways following British practice  These are 120 mm high  180 mm deep and 56 mm wide and weigh about 1400 g  and can have up to 16 separate contacts  for example  12 make and 4 break contacts  Many of these relays come in 12V  24V and 50V versions   The BR Q type relay are available in a number of different configurations   QN1 Neutral  QL1 Latched   see above  QNA1 AC immune  QBA1 Biased AC immune   see above  QNN1 Twin Neutral 2x4 4 or 2x6 2  QBCA1 Contactor for high current applications such as point motors  Also DC biased and AC immune   QTD4   Slow to release timer  QTD5   Slow to pick up timer Since rail signal circuits must be highly reliable  special techniques are used to detect and prevent failures in the relay system  To protect against false feeds  double switching relay contacts are often used on both the positive and negative side of a circuit  so that two false feeds are needed to cause a false signal  Not all relay circuits can be proved so there is reliance on construction features such as carbon to silver contacts to resist lightning induced contact welding and to provide AC immunity   Opto isolators are also used in some instances with railway signalling  especially where only a single contact is to be switched   Signalling relays  typical circuits  drawing symbols  abbreviations & nomenclature  etc  come in a number of schools  including the United States  France  Germany  and the United Kingdom   8  History  The American scientist Joseph Henry invented a relay in 1835 in order to improve his version of the electrical telegraph  developed earlier in 1831   It is claimed that the English inventor Edward Davy  certainly invented the electric relay  in his electric telegraph c 1835   A simple device  which we now call a relay  was included in the original 1840 telegraph patent of Samuel Morse  The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier  repeating the telegraph signal  and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired  This overcame the problem of limited range of earlier telegraphy schemes   The word relay appears in the context of electromagnetic operations from 1860   9  See also  Contactor  Digital protective relay
