Deep Submergence Vessel NR 1 was a unique United States Navy nuclear powered ocean engineering and research submarine  Built by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics at Groton  Connecticut NR 1 was launched on 25 January 1969  completed initial sea trials 19 August 1969  and was home ported at Naval Submarine Base New London  NR 1 was the smallest nuclear submarine ever put into operation  Casually known as  Nerwin   NR 1 was never officially named or commissioned  The U S  Navy is allocated a specific number of warships by the U S  Congress  Admiral Hyman Rickover not only avoided using one of those allocations  but he also wanted to avoid the oversight that a warship receives from various bureaus   1  History  NR 1 s missions included search  object recovery  geological survey  oceanographic research  and installation and maintenance of underwater equipment  NR 1 s unique capability to remain at one site and completely map or search an area with a high degree of accuracy was a valuable asset on several occasions   Through the 1970s and 1980s   NR 1  conducted numerous classified missions involving recovery of objects from the floor of the deep sea  These missions remain classified and few details have been made public  One publicly acknowledged mission in 1976 was to recover parts of an F 14 that was lost from the deck of an aircraft carrier and sank with at least one of the then new AIM 54A Phoenix air to air missiles  The secrecy normal to USN submarine operations was heightened by Rickover s personal involvement  Rickover shared details of  NR 1  operations on a need to know basis  Rickover envisioned building a small fleet of NR 1 type submarines  but only one was built due to budget restrictions   Following the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986  NR 1 was used to search for  identify  and recover critical parts of the Challenger craft  Because it could remain on the sea floor without resurfacing frequently  NR 1 was a major tool for searching deep waters  NR 1 remained submerged and on station even when heavy weather and rough seas hit the area and forced all other search and recovery ships into port   In 1995  Dr  Robert Ballard used the NR 1 and its support ship    to explore the wreck of   the sister ship of   which sank off the coast of Greece while serving as a hospital ship during World War I   On 25 February 2007  NR 1  towed by Carolyn Chouest  arrived in Galveston  Texas  in preparation for an expedition to survey the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and other sites in the Gulf of Mexico   NR 1 was deactivated on 21 November 2008 at the U S  Navy submarine base at Groton  Connecticut  defuelled at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery  Maine  then sent to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to be scrapped  On 13 November  2013  the U S  Navy announced that salvaged pieces of the sub would be put on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton   2  Capabilities  NR 1 performed underwater search and recovery  oceanographic research missions and installation and maintenance of underwater equipment to a depth of almost half a nautical mile  Its features included extending bottoming wheels  three viewing ports  exterior lighting  television and still cameras for color photographic studies  an object recovery claw  a manipulator that could be fitted with various gripping and cutting tools and a work basket that could be used in conjunction with the manipulator to deposit or recover items in the sea  Surface vision was provided by a television periscope permanently installed on a fixed mast in her sail area   NR 1 had sophisticated electronics  computers and sonar systems that aided in navigation  communications  and object location and identification  It could maneuver or hold a steady position on or close to the seabed or underwater ridges  detect and identify objects at a considerable distance  and lift objects off the ocean floor   NR 1 was equipped with two electric motor driven propellers and its maneuverability was enhanced by four ducted thrusters  two forward and two aft  The vehicle had diving planes mounted on the sail  and a conventional rudder   NR 1 could travel submerged at approximately four knots for long periods  limited only by consumable supplies — primarily food  It could study and map the ocean bottom  including temperature  currents  and other information for military  commercial and scientific uses  Its nuclear propulsion provided independence from surface support ships and essentially unlimited endurance   The NR 1 s size limited its crew comforts  The crew of about 10 men could stay at sea for as long as a month  but had no kitchen or bathing facilities  They ate frozen TV dinners  bathed once a week with a bucket of water and burned chlorate candles to produce oxygen  The sub was so slow that it was towed to sea by a surface vessel  and so tiny that the crew felt the push and pull of the ocean s currents   Everybody on NR 1 got sick   said Allison J  Holifield  who commanded the sub in the mid 1970s   It was only a matter of whether you were throwing up or not throwing up    NR 1 was generally towed to and from remote mission locations by an accompanying surface tender  which was also capable of conducting research in conjunction with the submarine  NR 1 s last mother ship was MV Carolyn Chouest  which provided towing  communications  berthing and direct mission support for all NR 1 operations  An extremely versatile platform  she was an indispensable member of the NR 1 deep submergence team  NR 1 command was manned with thirty five Navy personnel and ten civilian contractor personnel  NR 1 carried as many as thirteen persons  crew and specialists  at one time  including three of the four assigned officers   The operations officer rode on Carolyn Chouest   All personnel that crewed NR 1 were nuclear trained and specifically screened and interviewed by the Director  Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program   3  Awards  4  See also  5  References  6  Further reading  7  External links
