Rabbinical Assembly  opening itself up to rabbis ordained at institutions other than JTS   The longest serving president of the Rabbinical Assembly was Wolfe Kelman  who accepted the post in 1951 and continued in the post until 1989   In 1985  the RA admitted its first female member  Amy Eilberg  the first female ordainee at JTS  It immediately proceeded to admit Rabbis Jan Caryl Kaufman and Beverly Magidson  who had been ordained at Hebrew Union College  By 2010  273 of the 1648 members of the Rabbinical Assembly were women   In 1989  upon Wolfe Kelman s retirement  Joel H  Meyers became

head  It presently composed of 25 Rabbis  who are voting members  and five laypeople  who do not vote but participate fully in deliberations  When any six  or more  members vote in favor of a position  that position becomes an official position of the Rabbinical Assembly  An individual rabbi  however  functions as the mara de atra  מרא דאתרא  lit   master of the house  in Aramaic  the local authority in Jewish law   adopting the position he or she considers most compelling  even if it has not been approved by the CJLS   The Rabbinical Assembly of Israel  the Israeli arm of the RA  has its own decision making body  the Va ad Halacha  Responsa by both the CJLS and the Va ad Halacha are equally valid  although the Va ad s emphasis is on issues pertaining to Israeli society  The CJLS
