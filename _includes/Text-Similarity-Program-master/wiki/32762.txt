Vinegar is a liquid consisting mainly of acetic acid  CH3COOH  and water  The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria  Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient  Historically  as the most easily available mild acid  it had a great variety of industrial  medical  and domestic uses  some of which  such as its use as a general household cleanser  are still promoted today   Commercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow fermentation processes  In general  slow methods are used with traditional vinegars  and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of months or a year  The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria  Fast methods add mother of vinegar  bacterial culture  to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation  In fast production processes  vinegar may be produced in 20 hours to three days  With those fast processes  commercial vinegar contains residual alcohol   1  Varieties  1 1  Apple cider  Apple cider vinegar is made from cider or apple must  and has a brownish gold color  It is often sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the mother of vinegar present  as a natural product  It is often diluted with fruit juice or water  or sweetened  usually with honey  for consumption as a health beverage   1 2  Balsamic  Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces of Italy  The original productTraditional Balsamic Vinegaris made from the concentrated juice  or must of white Trebbiano grapes  It is very dark brown  rich  sweet  and complex  with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak  mulberry  chestnut  cherry  juniper and ash wood  Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes  traditional balsamic vinegar is marked  tradizionale  or  DOC  to denote its Protected Designation of Origin status  and is aged for 12 to 25 years  A cheaper non DOC commercial form described as  aceto balsamico di Modena   balsamic vinegar of Modena  became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century  typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar  then coloured and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar   Regardless of how it is produced  balsamic vinegar must be made from a grape product  It contains no balsam fruit  A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients  making it very mellow   1 3  Beer  Vinegar made from beer is produced in the United Kingdom  Germany  Austria  and the Netherlands  Although its flavor depends on the particular type of beer from which it is made  it is often described as having a malty taste  That produced in Bavaria is a light golden color with a very sharp and not overly complex flavor   1 4  Cane  Cane vinegar  made from sugarcane juice  is most popular in the Philippines  in particular  the Ilocos Region of the northern Philippines  where it is called sukang iloko   although it also is produced in France and the United States  It ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color  and has a mellow flavor  similar in some respects to rice vinegar  though with a somewhat  fresher  taste  Because it contains no residual sugar  it is no sweeter than any other vinegar  In the Philippines  it often is labeled as sukang maasim  Tagalog for  sour vinegar     Cane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways  One way is to simply place sugar cane juice in large jars and it will directly become sour by the direct action of bacteria on the sugar  The other way is through fermentation to produce a local wine known as  basi   Low quality  basi  is then allowed to undergo acetic acid fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid  Contaminated  basi  also become vinegar   A white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years  where it is the cheapest type of vinegar sold  It is now common for other types of vinegar  made from wine  rice and apple cider  to be sold mixed with cane vinegar to lower the costs   1 5  Coconut  Coconut vinegar  made from fermented coconut water or sap  is used extensively in Southeast Asian cuisine  as in the Philippines   as well as in some cuisines of India  especially Goan cuisine  A cloudy white liquid  it has a particularly sharp  acidic taste with a slightly yeasty note   1 6  Date  Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the Middle East   1 7  Distilled  The term  distilled vinegar  is something of a misnomer  because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled alcohol  The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8% acetic acid in water  with a pH of about 2 4  This is variously known as distilled spirit   virgin  vinegar  or white vinegar  and is used in cooking  baking  meat preservation  and pickling  as well as medicinal  laboratory  and cleaning purposes  The most common starting material in some regions  because of its low cost  is malt  in the United States  corn  maize   such as the Heinz brand  It is sometimes derived from petroleum   1 8  East Asian black  Chinese black vinegar is an aged product made from rice  wheat  millet  sorghum  or a combination thereof  It has an inky black color and a complex  malty flavor  There is no fixed recipe  so some Chinese black vinegars may contain added sugar  spices  or caramel color  The most popular variety  Zhenjiang vinegar  originates in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province  eastern China  Shanxi mature vinegar  山西老陈醋  is another popular type of Chinese vinegar that is made exclusively from sorghum and other grains  Nowadays in Shanxi province  there are still some traditional vinegar workshops producing handmade vinegar which aged for at least five years with a high acidity  Only the vinegar made in Taiyuan and some counties in Jinzhong and aged for at least three years is considered authentic Shanxi mature vinegar according to the latest national standard of Shanxi mature vinegar   A somewhat lighter form of black vinegar  made from rice  is produced in Japan  where it is called kurozu  Since 2004  it has been marketed as a healthful drink  its manufacturers claim it contains high concentrations of amino acids  Recent research on kurozu has revealed its anticancer properties in vivo on rats  and in vitro on human cancer cells   1 9  Fruit  Fruit vinegars are made from fruit wines  usually without any additional flavoring  Common flavors of fruit vinegar include apple  blackcurrant  raspberry  quince  and tomato  Typically  the flavors of the original fruits remain in the final product   Most fruit vinegars are produced in Europe  where there is a growing market for high price vinegars made solely from specific fruits  as opposed to non fruit vinegars that are infused with fruits or fruit flavors   Several varieties  however  also are produced in Asia  Persimmon vinegar  called gam sikcho  감식초   is popular in South Korea  Jujube vinegar  called zaocu or hongzaocu     and wolfberry vinegar  called gouqicu     are produced in China   Jamun sirka  Hindi  जामुन सिरका   a vinegar produced from the jamun fruit in India  is considered to be medicinally valuable for stomach  spleen  and diabetic ailments   1 10  Honey  Vinegar made from honey is rare  although commercially available honey vinegars are produced in Italy  France  Romania  and Spain   1 11  Job s tears  In Japan  an aged vinegar also is made from Job s tears  a tall  grain bearing  tropical plant  The vinegar is similar in flavor to rice vinegar   1 12  Kiwifruit  A byproduct of commercial kiwifruit growing is a large amount of waste in the form of misshapen or otherwise rejected fruit  which may constitute up to 30 percent of the crop  and kiwifruit pomace  the presscake residue left after kiwifruit juice manufacture  One of the uses for this waste is the production of kiwifruit vinegar  produced commercially in New Zealand since at least the early 1990s  and in China in 2008   1 13  Kombucha  Kombucha vinegar is made from kombucha  a symbiotic culture of yeast and bacteria  The bacteria produce a complex array of nutrients and populate the vinegar with bacteria that some claim promote a healthy digestive tract  although no scientific studies have confirmed this  Kombucha vinegar primarily is used to make a vinaigrette  and is flavored by adding strawberries  blackberries  mint  or blueberries at the beginning of fermentation   1 14  Malt  Malt vinegar  also called Alegar  is made by malting barley  causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose  Then an ale is brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar  which is then aged  It is typically light brown in color  In the United Kingdom and Canada  malt vinegar  along with salt  is a traditional seasoning for fish and chips  but some commercial fish and chip shops will use non brewed condiment   1 15  Palm  Palm vinegar  made from the fermented sap from flower clusters of the nipa palm  also called attap palm   is used most often in the Philippines  where it is produced  and where it is called sukang paombong  It has a citrusy flavor note to it and imparts a distinctly musky aroma  Its pH is between five and six   1 16  Raisin  Vinegar made from raisins  called    grape vinegar   is used in cuisines of the Middle East  and is produced there  It is cloudy and medium brown in color  with a mild flavor   1 17  Rice  Rice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia  It is available in  white   light yellow   red  and black varieties  The Japanese prefer a light rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings  Red rice vinegar traditionally is colored with red yeast rice  Black rice vinegar  made with black glutinous rice  is most popular in China  and it is also widely used in other East Asian countries   White rice vinegar has a mild acidity with a somewhat  flat  and uncomplex flavor  Some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings   1 18  Sherry  Sherry vinegar is linked to the production of sherrywines of Jerez  Dark mahogany in color  it is made exclusively from the acetic fermentation of wines  It is concentrated and has generous aromas  including a note of wood  ideal for vinaigrettes and flavoring various foods   1 19  Spirit  The term  spirit vinegar  is sometimes reserved for the stronger variety  5% to 21% acetic acid  made from sugar cane or from chemically produced acetic acid   1 20  White  See Distilled vinegar   1 21  Wine  Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine  and is the most commonly used vinegar in Southern and Central Europe  As with wine  there is a considerable range in quality  Better quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two years  and exhibit a complex  mellow flavor  Wine vinegar tends to have a lower acidity than white or cider vinegars  More expensive wine vinegars are made from individual varieties of wine  such as champagne  sherry  or pinot gris   SUGARCANE SIRKA INDIAN Sirka is made from juice of cane in earthen pot in Punjab in India  During summer the people put cane use in earthen pots with iron nails  The fermentation takes place due action of wild yeast The cane juice is conveyed to vinegar having blackish color The sirka is used to preserve pickles and flavoring curries  It is main ingredient in Indian kitchen   2  Uses  2 1  Culinary  Vinegar is commonly used in food preparation  in particular in pickling processes  vinaigrettes  and other salad dressings  It is an ingredient

for instance Posca  Other preparations range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts of fruity vinegar to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar essence for several days  then sieving off solid parts  and adding considerable amounts of sugar  Some prefer to also boil the result as a final step  These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated beverages  such as soft drinks   2 2  Medical  Many remedies and treatments have been ascribed to vinegar over millennia and in many different cultures  however  few have been verifiable using controlled medical trials and many that are effective to some degree have significant side effects and carry the possibility of serious health risks   2 2 1  Possible cholesterol and triacylglycerol effects  A 2006 study concluded that a test group of rats fed with acetic acid  the main component of vinegar  had  significantly lower values for serum total cholesterol and triacylglycerol  and other health benefits  Rats fed vinegar or acetic acid have lower blood pressure than controls  although the effect has not been tested in humans  Reduced risk of fatal ischemic heart disease was observed among human participants in a trial who ate vinegar and oil salad dressings frequently   2 2 2  Blood glucose control and diabetic management  Prior to hypoglycemic agents  diabetics used vinegar teas to control their symptoms  Small amounts of vinegar  approximately 25g of domestic vinegar  added to food  or taken along with a meal  have been shown by a number of medical trials to reduce the glycemic index of carbohydrate food for people with and without diabetes  This also has been expressed as lower glycemic index ratings in the region of 30%   2 2 3  Diet control  Multiple trials indicate that taking vinegar with food increases satiety  the feeling of fullness  and  so  reduces the amount of food consumed  Daily intake of 15 mL of vinegar  750 mg acetic acid  might be useful in the prevention of metabolic syndrome by reducing obesity   2 2 4  Antimicrobial and medicinal  Vinegar was thought to be useful for treating infections in ancient times  Hippocrates  460–377 BC  prescribed it for curing pleurisy  fever  ulcers  and constipation  it was used by the ancient Egyptians to kill bacteria  When combined with honey to create oxymel  it was a common cough medicine in the ancient world  Vinegar also had multiple uses in ancient Babylon  where it was made from wine beginning around 5000 BC  The Babylonians used vinegar to preserve food and as a component of medicines   Researchers at the Food Biotechnology Department  Instituto de la Grasa  CSIC  in Seville  Spain conducted research on the antimicrobial activity of several food products  including vinegar  The following microorganisms were used in the study  S  aureus  L  monocytogenes  S  Enteritidis  E coli 0157 H7  S  sonnei  and Yersinia sp  Vinegar  5% acetic acid  showed bactericidal activity against all strains tested  which was attributed to its acidity   The phenolic composition analysis of vinegar shows the presence of gallic acid  4 hydroxybenzaldehyde  catechin  vanillic acid  caffeic acid  syringic acid  vanillin  syringaldehyde  p coumaric acid  m coumaric acid  anisaldehyde  epicatechin  sinapic acid  salicylaldehyde  scopoletin  veratraldehyde and o coumaric acid   The active ingredient in vinegar  acetic acid  can effectively kill mycobacteria  even highly drug resistant strains  Acetic acid could therefore be used as an inexpensive and non toxic disinfectant against drug resistant tuberculosis  TB  bacteria as well as other stubborn  disinfectant resistant mycobacteria   See cleaning uses for further references regarding antimicrobial use   2 2 5  Other medicinal  Applying vinegar to common jellyfish stings deactivates the nematocysts  however  placing the affected areas in hot water is a more effective treatment because the venom is deactivated by heat  The latter requires immersion in water for at least four minutes for the pain to be reduced to less than what would be accomplished using vinegar  This does not apply to the Portuguese man o  war  which  although generally considered to be a jellyfish  is not  vinegar applied to Portuguese man o  war stings can cause their nematocysts to discharge venom  making the pain worse   Vinegar has been shown ineffective for use against lice  Combined with 60% Salicylic acid it is significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of warts   Contrary to popular belief  vinegar cannot be used as a detoxification agent to circumvent urinalysis testing for cannabis   2 2 6  Potential hazards  Like other acids  the acetic acid in vinegar attacks the enamel of the teeth and will cause decay and sensitivity in the teeth  Like with other acids the recommendations are to minimize consumption  minimize time in the mouth  not swirl it in the mouth  and counteract the effects by using fluoride mouthwash or toothpaste  Esophageal injury by apple cider vinegar tablets has been reported  and  because vinegar products sold for medicinal purposes are neither regulated nor standardized  they vary widely in content  pH  and other respects  Long term heavy vinegar ingestion has one recorded case of possibly causing hypokalemia  hyperreninemia  and osteoporosis   2 2 7  Cervical cancer screening tool  Diluted vinegar 3% to 5%  has also been tested as an effective screening tool for cervical cancer  Vinegar changes the color of affected tissue to white  making diagnosis by inspection possible  reducing by 35% the mortality for early detection against control group   2 2 8  In traditional Islamic medicine  Ibn Sina  in his famous eleventh century book The Canon of Medicine  mentioned several beneficial medicinal uses for vinegar  claiming that it was a powerful clotting agent  healed burns and skin inflammations  and it relieved headaches caused by heat  He also considered vinegar a good digestive supplement  Fourteenth century Ibn Qayyim Al Jawziyya also mentions the merits of vinegar in his book  Al Tibb al Nabawi  The Prophetic Medicine   In this book  he claimed that wine vinegar helps against gastric inflammation and bile  and prevents the effects of toxic medications and poisonous mushrooms   2 3  Scientific  The electrical conductivity of many materials increases as an applied external electric field increases in strength  This is known as the  second Wien effect  and Lars Onsager investigated this effect using acetic acid solutions in 1934   2 4  Cleaning  White vinegar is often used as a household cleaning agent  Because it is acidic  it can dissolve mineral deposits from glass  coffee makers  and other smooth surfaces  For most uses  dilution with water is recommended for safety and to avoid damaging the surfaces being cleaned   Vinegar is an excellent solvent for cleaning epoxy resin and hardener  even after the epoxy has begun to harden  Malt vinegar sprinkled onto crumpled newspaper is a traditional  and still popular  method of cleaning grease smeared windows and mirrors in the United Kingdom  Vinegar can be used for polishing brass or bronze  Vinegar is widely known as an effective cleaner of stainless steel and glass   Vinegar has been reputed to have strong antibacterial properties  One test by Good Housekeeping s microbiologist found that 5% vinegar is 90% effective against mold and 99 9% effective against bacteria  though another study showed that vinegar is less effective than Clorox and Lysol against poliovirus  In modern times experts have advised against using vinegar as a household disinfectant against human pathogens  as it is less effective than chemical disinfectants   Vinegar is ideal for washing produce because it breaks down the wax coating and kills bacteria and mold  The editors of Cook s Illustrated found vinegar to be the most effective and safest way to wash fruits and vegetables  beating antibacterial soap  water and just a scrub brush in removing bacteria   Vinegar has been marketed as an environmentally friendly solution for many household cleaning problems  For example  vinegar has been cited recently as an eco friendly urine cleaner for pets   Vinegar is effective in removing clogs from drains  polishing silver  copper and brass as well as ungluing sticker type price tags  Vinegar is one of the best ways to restore color to upholstery like curtains and carpet   Vinegar also can help remove wallpaper  If the paper is coated with a mixture of vinegar and boiling water  it breaks down the glue for easy removal   2 5  Agricultural and horticultural  Vinegar can be used as an herbicide  Acetic acid is not absorbed into root systems  the vinegar will kill top growth  but perennial plants may reshoot   3  Miscellaneous  Most commercial vinegar solutions available to consumers for household use do not exceed 5%  Solutions above 10% require careful handling  because they are corrosive and damaging to the skin   When a bottle of vinegar is opened  mother of vinegar may develop  It is considered harmless and can be removed by filtering   Vinegar eels  Turbatrix aceti   a form of nematode  may occur in some forms of vinegar unless the vinegar is kept covered  These feed on the mother of vinegar and can occur in naturally fermenting vinegar   Some countries prohibit the selling of vinegar over a certain percentage acidity  As an example  the government of Canada limits the acetic acid of vinegars to between 4 1% and 12 3%   According to legend  in France during the Black Plague  four thieves were able to rob houses of plague victims without being infected themselves  When finally caught  the judge offered to grant the men their freedom  on the condition that they revealed how they managed to stay healthy  They claimed that a medicine woman sold them a potion made of garlic soaked in soured red wine  vinegar   Variants of the recipe  called Four Thieves Vinegar  have been passed down for hundreds of years and are a staple of New Orleans hoodoo practices   A solution of vinegar can be used for water slide decal application as used on scale models and musical instruments  among other things  One part white distilled vinegar  5% acidity  diluted with two parts of distilled or filtered water creates a suitable solution for the application of water slide decals to hard surfaces  The solution is very similar to the commercial products  often described as  decal softener   sold by hobby shops  The slight acidity of the solution softens the decal and enhances its flexibility  permitting the decal to cling to contours more efficiently   When baking soda and vinegar are combined  the bicarbonate ion of the baking soda reacts to form carbonic acid  which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water   4  See also  Food additive  List of condiments  Non brewed
