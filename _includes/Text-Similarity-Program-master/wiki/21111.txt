respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but     you know  Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help

the great living male movie stars  De Niro  Nicholson and Pacino  usually  How often do you see the name of Nicolas Cage  He should always be up there  He s daring and fearless in his choice of roles  and unafraid to crawl out on a limb  saw it off and remain suspended in air  No one else can project inner trembling so effectively    he always seems so earnest  However improbable his character  he never winks at the audience  He is committed to the character with every atom and plays him as if he were him   In response to mixed reviews of Knowing and their focus on criticizing Cage  Ebert defended both Cage as an actor and the film which  in contrast to other critics  he gave four out of four stars   Lord of War co star Ethan Hawke said of Cage   He s the only actor since Marlon Brando that s actually done anything new with the art of acting  he s successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours   While stating that Cage had hurt his career by working on too many poor projects   he s put a little too much water in his beer    Hawke added   If I could erase his bottom half bad movies  and only keep his top half movies  he would blow everyone else out of the water    At the 1996 Academy Awards  Cage won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Leaving Las
