Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous country with a dominant agricultural sector  Cotton  tobacco  wool  and meat are the main agricultural products  although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity  According to   the economy relies heavily on the strength of industrial exports  with plentiful reserves of gold  mercury  uranium and natural gas  The economy also relies heavily on remittances from foreign workers  Following independence  Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms  such as an improved regulatory system and land reform  Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States  CIS  country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization  Much of the government s stock in enterprises has been sold  Kyrgyzstan s economic performance has been hindered by widespread corruption  low foreign investment and general regional instability  Despite political corruption and regional instability  Kyrgyzstan is ranked 70th  as of 2013  on the Ease of doing Business Index   1  Macro economic trend  This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Kyrgyzstan at market prices by the International Monetary Fund and EconStats with figures in millions of Kyrgyz Soms   For purchasing power parity comparisons  the US Dollar is exchanged at 9 40 Soms only   of Kyrgyzstan shrank by 54% in the 1990s  Mean wages were $0 85 per manhour in 2009 and this rate represented underemployment when compared to effective market pay  In the first half of 2012  Kyrgyz economy shrank by 5 8%  This downturn was largely due to decline in gold production at the Kumtor mine   The budget deficit in mid 2012 was 23 billion soms and accounted for 7% of GDP while the target was to reduce it to 6%   2  Finance  On October 2012  International reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity of Kyrgyzstan National Bank have reached US $1 96 bln  8 6% of which is in gold  In 2012  to diversify the assets of Kyrgyzstan  the basket of currencies has been expanded by means of the Chinese yuan and the Singapore dollar  In 2012  1 billion soms are to be spent for the purchase of gold  Gold proportion in international reserves has already grown to 8 6%  The National Bank plans to increase it to 12 15% in future   3  Industries  3 1  Agriculture  Agriculture remains a vital part of Kyrgyzstan’s economy and a refuge for workers displaced from industry  Subsistence farming has increased in the early 2000s  After sharp reductions in the early 1990s  by the early 2000s agricultural production was approaching 1991 levels  Grain production in the lower valleys and livestock grazing on upland pastures occupy the largest share of the agricultural workforce  Farmers are shifting to grain and away from cotton and tobacco  Other important products are dairy products  hay  animal feed  potatoes  vegetables  and sugar beets  Agricultural output comes from private household plots  55 percent of the total   private farms  40 percent   and state farms  5 percent   Further expansion of the sector depends on banking reform to increase investment  and on market reform to streamline the distribution of inputs  Land reform  a controversial issue in Kyrgyzstan  has proceeded very slowly since initial legislation in 1998  The irrigation infrastructure is in poor condition  Agriculture contributes about one third of the GDP and more than one third of employment   3 2  Forestry  Only 4 percent of Kyrgyzstan is classified as forested  All of that area is state owned  and none is classified as available for wood supply  The main commercial product of the forests is walnuts   3 3  Fishing  Kyrgyzstan does not have a significant fishing industry  In 2002 aquaculture contributed 66 percent of the country’s total output of 142 metric tons of fish  but in 2003 the aquaculture industry collapsed  producing only 12 of the country’s total of 26 metric tons   3 4  Mining and minerals  In the post Soviet era  mining has been an increasingly important economic activity  The Kumtor Gold Mine  which opened in 1997  is based on one of the largest gold deposits in the world  New gold mines are planned at Jerooy and Taldy–Bulak  and a major gold discovery was announced at Tokhtonysay in late 2006  The state agency Kyrgyzaltyn owns all mines  many of which are operated as joint ventures with foreign companies  Uranium and antimony  important mineral outputs of the Soviet era  no longer are produced in significant amounts  Although between 1992 and 2003 coal output dropped from about 2 4 million tons to 411 000 tons  the government plans to increase exploitation of Kyrgyzstan’s considerable remaining deposits  estimated at 2 5 billion tons  in order to reduce dependency on foreign energy sources  A particular target of this policy is the Kara–Keche deposit in northern Kyrgyzstan  whose annual output capability is estimated at between 500 000 and 1 million tons  The small domestic output of oil and natural gas does not meet national needs   3 5  Industry and manufacturing  In the post Soviet era  Kyrgyzstan’s industries suffered sharp reductions in productivity because the supply of raw materials and fuels was disrupted  and Soviet markets disappeared  The sector has not recovered appreciably from that reduction  if gold production is not counted  in 2005 industry contributed only 14 percent of the gross domestic product  GDP   Investment and restructuring have remained at low levels  and the electricity industry  traditionally an important part of industry’s contribution to GDP  has stagnated in recent years  Government support is moving away from the machine industries  which were a major contributor to the Soviet economy  toward clothing and textiles  Food processing accounted for 10 to 15 percent of industrial production until encountering a slump in 2004  In recent years  the glass industry has surpassed clothing and textiles in investment received and as a contributor to GDP  In the early 2000s  the construction industry has grown steadily because of large infrastructure projects such as highways and new gold mines  Housing construction  however  has lagged because of low investment   3 6  Energy  More than ninety percent of electricity produced is hydroelectric and the country could produce much more of such clean energy and export to its neighbors and the region  Even though Kyrgyzstan has abundant hydro resources  only less than ten percent of its potential has been developed so far  It has limited deposits of fossil fuels and most of natural gas imports come from Uzbekistan  with which Kyrgyzstan has had a series of imperfect barter agreements  Per capita energy consumption is high considering average income  and the government has no comprehensive plan to reduce demand  Up to 45 percent of electricity generated  especially in winter time  is diverted illegally or leaks from the distribution system  Hydroelectric plants generate some 92 5 percent of domestically consumed electricity  and three commercial thermoelectric plants are in operation  Because of its rich supply of hydroelectric power  Kyrgyzstan sends electricity to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan before in return for fossil fuels  A new hydroelectric plant on the Naryn River at Kambar–Ata would supply power to parts of China and Russia  improving Kyrgyzstan’s export situation and domestic energy supply  However  in 2006 that project  which would include one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world  remained incomplete because of lack of investment  An antiquated infrastructure and poor management make Kyrgyzstan more dependent on foreign energy in winter when water levels are low  In the early 2000s  Kyrgyzstan was exploiting only an estimated 10 percent of its hydroelectric power potential  In 2001 Kyrgyzstan had about 70 000 kilometers of power transmission lines served by about 500 substations  Kyrgyzstan would be a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Asian Energy Club  which Russia proposed in 2006 to unify oil  gas  and electricity producers  consumers  and transit countries in the Central Asian region in a bloc that is self sufficient in energy  Other members would be China  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan  and Uzbekistan   Kyrgyzstan is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme  which has four key topics  enhancing energy security  convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles  supporting sustainable energy development  and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest   The South Korean style manufactured bituminous coal called yeontan  йонтан  is gaining popularity in Kyrgyzstan s energy industrial scene   3 7  Services  Substantial post Soviet growth in the services sector is mainly attributable to the appearance of small private enterprises  The central bank is the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic  which nominally is independent but follows government policy  Although the banking system has been reformed several times since 1991  it does not play a significant role in investment  High interest rates have discouraged borrowing  A stock market opened in 1995  but its main function is trading in government securities  Because of the Akayev regime’s economic reforms  many small trade and catering enterprises have opened in the post Soviet era  Although Kyrgyzstan’s mountains and lakes are an attractive tourist destination  the tourism industry has grown very slowly because it has received little investment  In the early 2000s  an average of about 450 000 tourists visited annually  mainly from countries of the former Soviet Union   4  External trade  Kyrgyzstan s principal exports  which go overwhelmingly to other CIS countries  are nonferrous metals and minerals  woolen goods and other agricultural products  electric energy  and certain engineering goods  In turn  the Republic relies on other former Soviet states for petroleum and natural gas  ferrous metals  chemicals  most machinery  wood and paper products  some foods  and most construction materials  In 1999  Kyrgyz exports to the U S  totaled $11 2 million  and imports from the U S  totaled $54 2 million  Kyrgyzstan exports antimony  mercury  rare earth metals  and other chemical products to the U S   and it imports grain  medicine and medical equipment  vegetable oil  paper products  rice  machinery  agricultural equipment  and meat from the U S   Reexport of China made consumer goods to Kazakhstan and Russia  centered on Dordoy Bazaar in Bishkek  and to Uzbekistan  centered on Kara Suu Bazaar in Osh Province  is particularly important  it is thought by some economists to be one the country s two largest economic activities   The Kyrgyzstan Government has reduced expenditures  ended most price subsidies  and introduced a value added tax  Overall  the government appears committed to transferring to a free market economic system by stabilizing the economy and implementing reforms  which will encourage long term growth  These reforms led to Kyrgyzstan s accession to the WTO on December 20  1998   5  Investment  The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Kyrgyzstan was valued at $42 million in 2005 by the World Bank   6  Other statistics  Investment  gross fixed
