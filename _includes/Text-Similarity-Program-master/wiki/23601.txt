The number is a mathematical constant  the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter  commonly approximated as 3 14159  It has been represented by the Greek letter    since the mid 18th century  though it is also sometimes spelled out as  pi       Being an irrational number  cannot be expressed exactly as a common fraction  although fractions such as 22 7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate   Consequently its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanent repeating pattern  The digits appear to be randomly distributed  however  to date  no proof of this has been discovered  Also  is a transcendental number – a number that is not the root of any non zero polynomial having rational coefficients  This transcendence of implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge   Although ancient civilizations needed the to be computed accurately for practical reasons  it was not calculated to more than seven digits  using geometrical techniques  in Chinese mathematics and to about five in Indian mathematics in the 5th century CE  The historically first exact formula for   based on infinite series  was not available until a millennium later  when in the 14th century the Madhava–Leibniz series was discovered in Indian mathematics  In the 20th and 21st centuries  mathematicians and computer scientists discovered new approaches that  when combined with increasing computational power  extended the decimal representation of to  as of late 2013  over 13 3 trillion  1013  digits  Scientific applications generally require no more than 40 digits of so the primary motivation for these computations is the human desire to break records  However  the extensive calculations involved have been used to test supercomputers and high precision multiplication algorithms   Because its definition relates to the circle  is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry  especially those concerning circles  ellipses or spheres  It is also found in formulae used in other branches of science such as cosmology  number theory  statistics  fractals  thermodynamics  mechanics and electromagnetism  The ubiquity of makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community  Several books devoted to it have been published  the number is celebrated on Pi Day and record setting calculations of the digits of often result in news headlines  Attempts to memorize the value of with increasing precision have led to records of over 67 000 digits   1  Fundamentals  1 1  Name  The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter is the lowercase Greek letter   sometimes spelled out as pi  In English  is pronounced as  pie         In mathematical use  the lowercase letter  or π in sans serif font  is distinguished from its capital counterpart   which denotes a product of a sequence   The choice of the symbol is discussed below   1 2  Definition  is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter    The ratio is constant  regardless of the circle s size  For example  if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference  preserving the ratio   This definition of implicitly makes use of flat  Euclidean  geometry  although the notion of a circle can be extended to any curved  non Euclidean  geometry  these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula   There are also other definitions of that do not immediately involve circles at all  For example  is twice the smallest positive for which equals 0   1 3  Properties  is an irrational number  meaning that it cannot be written as the ratio of two integers  fractions such as 22 7 are commonly used to approximate   no common fraction  ratio of whole numbers  can be its exact value   Since is irrational  it has an infinite number of digits in its decimal representation  and it does not settle into an infinitely repeating pattern of digits  There are several proofs that is irrational  they generally require calculus and rely on the reductio ad absurdum technique  The degree to which can be approximated by rational numbers  called the irrationality measure  is not precisely known  estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of or ln 2  but smaller than the measure of Liouville numbers  More strongly  is a transcendental number  which means that it is not the solution of any non constant polynomial with rational coefficients  such as The transcendence of has two important consequences  First  cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or n th roots such as or Second  since no transcendental number can be constructed with compass and straightedge  it is not possible to  square the circle   In other words  it is impossible to construct  using compass and straightedge alone  a square whose area is equal to the area of a given circle  Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the classical antiquity  Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and sometimes claim success despite the fact that it is impossible   The digits of have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for statistical randomness  including tests for normality  a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits  of any given length  appear equally often  The conjecture that is normal has not been proven or disproven  Since the advent of computers  a large number of digits of have been available on which to perform statistical analysis  Yasumasa Kanada has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of and found them consistent with normality  for example  the frequency of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to statistical significance tests  and no evidence of a pattern was found  Despite the fact that  s digits pass statistical tests for randomness  contains some sequences of digits that may appear non random to non mathematicians  such as the Feynman point  which is a sequence of six consecutive 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of    1 4  Continued fractions  Like all irrational numbers  cannot be represented as a common fraction  also known as a simple or vulgar fraction   by the very definition of  irrational   But every irrational number  including   can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions  called a continued fraction   Truncating the continued fraction at any point generates a fraction that provides an approximation for   two such fractions  22 7 and 355 113  have been used historically to approximate the constant  Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation  that is  each is closer to than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator  Because is known to be transcendental  it is by definition not algebraic and so cannot be a quadratic irrational  Therefore cannot have a periodic continued fraction  Although the simple continued fraction for  shown above  also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern  mathematicians have discovered several generalized continued fractions that do  such as   1 5  Approximate value  Some approximations of pi include   Integers  3  Fractions  Approximate fractions include  in order of increasing accuracy            and    List is selected terms from and     Decimal  The first 50 decimal digits are  Binary  The base 2 approximation to 48 digits is  Hexadecimal  The base 16 approximation to 20 digits is  Sexagesimal  A base 60 approximation to four sexagesimal digits is 3 8 29 44 1  2  History  2 1  Antiquity  The Great Pyramid at Giza  constructed –2566 BC  was built with a perimeter of about 1760 cubits and a height of about 280 cubits  the ratio 1760 280 ≈ 6 2857 is approximately equal to 2 ≈ 6 2832  Based on this ratio  some Egyptologists concluded that the pyramid builders had knowledge of and deliberately designed the pyramid to incorporate the proportions of a circle  Others maintain that the suggested relationship to is merely a coincidence  because there is no evidence that the pyramid builders had any knowledge of   and because the dimensions of the pyramid are based on other factors   The earliest written approximations of are found in Egypt and Babylon  both within 1 percent of the true value  In Babylon  a clay tablet dated 1900–1600 BC has a geometrical statement that  by implication  treats as 25 8   3 1250  In Egypt  the Rhind Papyrus  dated around 1650 BC  but copied from a document dated to 1850 BC has a formula for the area of a circle that treats as  16 9 2 ≈ 3 1605   In India around 600 BC  the Shulba Sutras  Sanskrit texts that are rich in mathematical contents  treat as  9785 5568 2 ≈ 3 088  In 150 BC  or perhaps earlier  Indian sources treat as  ≈ 3 1622   Two verses in the Hebrew Bible  written between the 8th and 3rd centuries BC  describe a ceremonial pool in the Temple of Solomon with a diameter of ten cubits and a circumference of thirty cubits  the verses imply is about three if the pool is circular  Rabbi Nehemiah explained the discrepancy as being due to the thickness of the vessel  His early work of geometry  Mishnat ha Middot  was written around 150 AD and takes the value of to be three and one seventh   See Approximations of π   2 2  Polygon approximation era  The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of was a geometrical approach using polygons  devised around 250 BC by the Greek mathematician Archimedes  This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1 000 years  and as a result is sometimes referred to as  Archimedes  constant   Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle  and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96 sided regular polygon  By calculating the perimeters of these polygons  he proved that 223 71      22 7  3 1408      3 1429   Archimedes  upper bound of 22 7 may have led to a widespread popular belief that is equal to 22 7  Around 150 AD  Greek Roman scientist Ptolemy  in his Almagest  gave a value for of 3 1416  which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga  Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of in 1630  a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits   In ancient China  values for included 3 1547  around 1 AD    100 AD  approximately 3 1623   and 142 45  3rd century  approximately 3 1556   Around 265 AD  the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3 072 sided polygon to obtain a value of of 3 1416  Liu later invented a faster method of calculating and obtained a value of 3 14 with a 96 sided polygon  by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of 4  The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi  around 480 AD  calculated that  ≈ 355 113  a fraction that goes by the name Milü in Chinese   using Liu Hui s algorithm applied to a 12 288 sided polygon  With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits  this value of 3 141592920    remained the most accurate approximation of available for the next 800 years   The Indian astronomer Aryabhata used a value of 3 1416 in his Āryabhaṭīya  499 AD   Fibonacci in c  1220 computed 3 1418 using a polygonal method  independent of Archimedes  Italian author Dante apparently employed the value  ≈ 3 14142   The Persian astronomer Jamshīd al Kāshī produced 16 digits in 1424 using a polygon with 3×228 sides  which stood as the world record for about 180 years  French mathematician François Viète in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3×217 sides  Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593  In 1596  Dutch mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen reached 20 digits  a record he later increased to 35 digits  as a result  was called the  Ludolphian number  in Germany until the early 20th century   Dutch scientist Willebrord Snellius reached 34 digits in 1621  and Austrian astronomer Christoph Grienberger arrived at 38 digits in 1630 using 1040 sides  which remains the most accurate approximation manually achieved using polygonal algorithms   2 3  Infinite series  The calculation of was revolutionized by the development of infinite series techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries  An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence  Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques  Although infinite series were exploited for most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  the approach was first discovered in India sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD  The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in his Tantrasamgraha  around 1500 AD  The series are presented without proof  but proofs are presented in a later Indian work  Yuktibhāṣā  from around 1530 AD  Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician  Madhava of Sangamagrama  who lived c  1350 – c  1425  Several infinite series are described  including series for sine  tangent  and cosine  which are now referred to as the Madhava series or Gregory–Leibniz series  Madhava used infinite series to estimate to 11 digits around 1400  but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician Jamshīd al Kāshī  using a polygonal algorithm   The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product  rather than an infinite sum  which are more typically used in calculations  found by French mathematician François Viète in 1593   The second infinite sequence found in Europe  by John Wallis in 1655  was also an infinite product  The discovery of calculus  by English scientist Isaac Newton and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 1660s  led to the development of many infinite series for approximating   Newton himself used an arcsin series to compute a 15 digit approximation of in 1665 or 1666  later writing  I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations  having no other business at the time    In Europe  Madhava s formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1671  and by Leibniz in 1674   This formula  the Gregory–Leibniz series  equals when evaluated with    1  In 1699  English mathematician Abraham Sharp used the Gregory–Leibniz series to compute to 71 digits  breaking the previous record of 39 digits  which was set with a polygonal algorithm  The Gregory–Leibniz series is simple  but converges very slowly  that is  approaches the answer gradually   so it is not used in modern calculations   In 1706 John Machin used the Gregory–Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster   Machin reached 100 digits of with this formula  Other mathematicians created variants  now known as Machin like formulae  that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of   Machin like formulae remained the best known method for calculating well into the age of computers  and were used to set records for 250 years  culminating in a 620 digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson – the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device   A record was set by the calculating prodigy Zacharias Dase  who in 1844 employed a Machin like formula to calculate 200 decimals of in his head at the behest of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss  British mathematician William Shanks famously took 15 years to calculate to 707 digits  but made a mistake in the 528th digit  rendering all subsequent digits incorrect   2 3 1  Rate of convergence  Some infinite series for converge faster than others  Given the choice of two infinite series for   mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate to any given accuracy  A simple infinite series for is the Gregory–Leibniz series   As individual terms of this infinite series are added to the sum  the total gradually gets closer to   and – with a sufficient number of terms – can get as close to as desired  It converges quite slowly  though – after 500 000 terms  it produces only five correct decimal digits of    An infinite series for  published by Nilakantha in the 15th century  that converges more rapidly than the Gregory–Leibniz series is   The following table compares the convergence rates of these two series   After five terms  the sum of the Gregory–Leibniz series is within 0 2 of the correct value of   whereas the sum of Nilakantha s series is within 0 002 of the correct value of   Nilakantha s series converges faster and is more useful for computing digits of   Series that converge even faster include Machin s series and Chudnovsky s series  the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term   2 4  Irrationality and transcendence  Not all mathematical advances relating to were aimed at increasing the accuracy of approximations  When Euler solved the Basel problem in 1735  finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares  he established a connection between and the prime numbers that later contributed to the development and study of the Riemann zeta function   Swiss scientist Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1761 proved that is irrational  meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers  Lambert s proof exploited a continued fraction representation of the tangent function  French mathematician Adrien Marie Legendre proved in 1794 that 2 is also irrational  In 1882  German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that is transcendental  confirming a conjecture made by both Legendre and Euler   2 5  Adoption of the symbol  The earliest known use of the Greek letter to represent the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter was by mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos  or  a New Introduction to the Mathematics  The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase  1 2 Periphery     in the discussion of a circle with radius one  Jones may have chosen because it was the first letter in the Greek spelling of the word periphery  However  he writes that his equations for are from the  ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr  John Machin   leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones  It had indeed been used earlier for geometric concepts  William Oughtred used and δ  the Greek letter equivalents of p and d  to express ratios of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of Clavis Mathematicae   After Jones introduced the Greek letter in 1706  it was not adopted by other mathematicians until Euler started using it  beginning with his 1736 work Mechanica  Before then  mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p instead  Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe  the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly  In 1748  Euler used in his widely read work Introductio in analysin infinitorum  he wrote   for the sake of brevity we will write this number as   thus is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1   and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world   3  Modern quest for more digits  3 1  Computer era and iterative algorithms  The development of computers in the mid 20th century again revolutionized the hunt for digits of   American mathematicians John Wrench and Levi Smith reached 1 120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator  Using an inverse tangent  arctan  infinite series  a team led by George Reitwiesner and John von Neumann that same year achieved 2 037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the ENIAC computer  The record  always relying on an arctan series  was broken repeatedly  7 480 digits in 1957  10 000 digits in 1958  100 000 digits in 1961  until 1 million digits were reached in 1973   Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute   First  the discovery of new iterative algorithms for computing   which were much faster than the infinite series  and second  the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly  Such algorithms are particularly important in modern computations  because most of the computer s time is devoted to multiplication  They include the Karatsuba algorithm  Toom–Cook multiplication  and Fourier transform based methods   The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent  These avoid reliance on infinite series  An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation  each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs  and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value  The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss  in what is now termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method  AGM method  or Gauss–Legendre algorithm  As modified by Salamin and Brent  it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm   The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms  whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms  iterative algorithms generally multiply the number of correct digits at each step  For example  the Brent Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration  In 1984  the Canadian brothers John and Peter Borwein produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step  and in 1987  one that increases the number of digits five times in each step  Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing between 1995 and 2002  This rapid convergence comes at a price  the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series   3 2  Motivations for computing  For most numerical calculations involving   a handful of digits provide sufficient precision  According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel  thirty nine digits are sufficient to perform most cosmological calculations  because that is the accuracy necessary to calculate the volume of the known universe with a precision of one atom  Despite this  people have worked strenuously to compute to thousands and millions of digits  This effort may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records  and such achievements with often make headlines around the world  They also have practical benefits  such as testing supercomputers  testing numerical analysis algorithms  including high precision multiplication algorithms   and within pure mathematics itself  providing data for evaluating the randomness of the digits of    3 3  Rapidly convergent series  Modern calculators do not use iterative algorithms exclusively  New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms  yet are simpler and less memory intensive  The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914  when the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published dozens of innovative new formulae for   remarkable for their elegance  mathematical depth  and rapid convergence  One of his formulae  based on modular equations  is  This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series  including Machin s formula  Bill Gosper was the first to use it for advances in the calculation of   setting a record of 17 million digits in 1985  Ramanujan s formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the Borwein brothers and the Chudnovsky brothers  The Chudnovsky formula developed in 1987 is  It produces about 14 digits of per term  and has been used for several record setting calculations  including the first to surpass 1 billion  109  digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers  2 7 trillion  2 7×1012  digits by Fabrice Bellard in 2009  and 10 trillion  1013  digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo  For similar formulas  see also the Ramanujan–Sato series   In 2006  Canadian mathematician Simon Plouffe used the PSLQ integer relation algorithm to generate several new formulas for   conforming to the following template   where is  Gelfond s constant   is an odd number  and are certain rational numbers that Plouffe computed   3 4  Spigot algorithms  Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into   They are called spigot algorithms because  like water dripping from a spigot  they produce single digits of that are not reused after they are calculated  This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms  which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced   American mathematicians Stan Wagon and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995  Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms  but not as fast as iterative algorithms   Another spigot algorithm  the BBP digit extraction algorithm  was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe   This formula  unlike others before it  can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of without calculating all the preceding digits  Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits  and octal digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits  Variations of the algorithm have been discovered  but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits  An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record computations  After a new record is claimed  the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal  and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end  if they match  this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct   Between 1998 and 2000  the distributed computing project PiHex used Bellard s formula  a modification of the BBP algorithm  to compute the quadrillionth  1015th  bit of   which turned out to be 0  In September 2010  a Yahoo  employee used the company s Hadoop application on one thousand computers over a 23 day period to compute 256 bits of at the two quadrillionth  2×1015th  bit  which also happens to be zero   4  Use  Because is closely related to the circle  it is found in many formulae from the fields of geometry and trigonometry  particularly those concerning circles  spheres  or ellipses  Formulae from other branches of science also include in some of their important formulae  including sciences such as statistics  fractals  thermodynamics  mechanics  cosmology  number theory  and electromagnetism   4 1  Geometry and trigonometry  appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles  such as ellipses  spheres  cones  and tori  Below are some of the more common formulae that involve    The circumference of a circle with radius is  The area of a circle with radius is  The volume of a sphere with radius is  The surface area of a sphere with radius is The formulae above are special cases of the surface area and volume of an n dimensional sphere   appears in definite integrals that describe circumference  area  or volume of shapes generated by circles  For example  an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by   In that integral the function represents the top half of a circle  the square root is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem   and the integral computes the area between that half of a circle and the axis  The trigonometric functions rely on angles  and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement  plays an important role in angles measured in radians  which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2 radians  The angle measure of 180° is equal to radians  and 1°    180 radians   Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of   for example  sine and cosine have period 2  so for any angle θ and any integer   and  4 1 1  Monte Carlo methods  Monte Carlo methods  which evaluate the results of multiple random trials  can be used to create approximations of   Buffon s needle is one such technique  If a needle of length is dropped times on a surface on which parallel lines are drawn units apart  and if of those times it comes to rest crossing a line     0   then one may approximate based on the counts   Another Monte Carlo method for computing is to draw a circle inscribed in a square  and randomly place dots in the square  The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal  Monte Carlo methods for approximating are very slow compared to other methods  and are never used to approximate when speed or accuracy are desired   4 2  Complex numbers and analysis  Any complex number  say   can be expressed using a pair of real numbers  In the polar coordinate system  one number  radius or r  is used to represent  s distance from the origin of the complex plane and the other  angle or φ  to represent a counter clockwise rotation from the positive real line as follows   where is the imaginary unit satisfying 2   −1  The frequent appearance of in complex analysis can be related to the behavior of the exponential function of a complex variable  described by Euler s formula   where the constant is the base of the natural logarithm  This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of and points on the unit circle centered at the origin of the complex plane  Setting   in Euler s formula results in Euler s identity  celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants   There are different complex numbers satisfying   and these are called the   th roots of unity   They are given by this formula   Cauchy s integral formula governs complex analytic functions and establishes an important relationship between integration and differentiation  including the fact that the values of a complex function within a closed boundary are entirely determined by the values on the boundary   An occurrence of in the Mandelbrot set fractal was discovered by American David Boll in 1991  He examined the behavior of the Mandelbrot set near the  neck  at  −0 75  0   If points with coordinates  −0 75  ε  are considered  as ε tends to zero  the number of iterations until divergence for the point multiplied by ε converges to   The point  0 25  ε  at the cusp of the large  valley  on the right side of the Mandelbrot set behaves similarly  the number of iterations until divergence multiplied by the square root of ε tends to    The gamma function extends the concept of factorial – which is normally defined only for non negative integers – to all complex numbers  except the negative real integers  When the gamma function is evaluated at half integers  the result contains   for example and   The gamma function can be used to create a simple approximation to for large   which is known as Stirling s approximation   4 3  Number theory and Riemann zeta function  The Riemann zeta function ζ s  is used in many areas of mathematics  When evaluated at it can be written as  Finding a simple solution for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the Basel problem  Leonhard Euler solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to   Euler s result leads to the number theory result that the probability of two random numbers being relatively prime  that is  having no shared factors  is equal to   This probability is based on the observation that the probability that any number is divisible by a prime is  for example  every 7th integer is divisible by 7   Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is   and the probability that at least one of them is not is   For distinct primes  these divisibility events are mutually independent  so the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes   This probability can be used in conjunction with a random number generator to approximate using a Monte Carlo approach   4 4  Probability and statistics  The fields of probability and statistics frequently use the normal distribution as a simple model for complex phenomena  for example  scientists generally assume that the observational error in most experiments follows a normal distribution  is found in the Gaussian function  which is the probability density function of the normal distribution  with mean and standard deviation    The area under the graph of the normal distribution curve is given by the Gaussian integral   while the related integral for the Cauchy distribution is  5  Outside mathematics  5 1  Describing physical phenomena  Although not a physical constant  appears routinely in equations describing fundamental principles of the universe  often because of  s relationship to the circle and to spherical coordinate systems  A simple formula from the field of classical mechanics gives the approximate period of a simple pendulum of length   swinging with a small amplitude   is the earth s gravitational acceleration    One of the key formulae of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg s uncertainty principle  which shows that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle s position  Δ  and momentum  Δ  cannot both be arbitrarily small at the same time  where is Planck s constant    In the domain of cosmology  appears in Einstein s field equation  a fundamental formula which forms the basis of the general theory of relativity and describes the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy   where is the Ricci curvature tensor  is the scalar curvature  is the metric tensor  is the cosmological constant  is Newton s gravitational constant  is the speed of light in vacuum  and is the stress–energy tensor   Coulomb s law  from the discipline of electromagnetism  describes the electric field between two electric charges  1 and 2  separated by distance  with 0 representing the vacuum permittivity of free space    The fact that is approximately equal to 3 plays a role in the relatively long lifetime of orthopositronium  The inverse lifetime to lowest order in the fine structure constant is  where m is the mass of the electron   is present in some structural engineering formulae  such as the buckling formula derived by Euler  which gives the maximum axial load that a long  slender column of length   modulus of elasticity   and area moment of inertia can

with dynamic viscosity η   The Fourier transform  defined below  is a mathematical operation that expresses time as a function of frequency  known as its frequency spectrum  It has many applications in physics and engineering  particularly in signal processing   Under ideal conditions  uniform gentle slope on an homogeneously erodible substrate   the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches   The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight line distance from source to mouth  Faster currents along the outside edges of a river s bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges  thus pushing the bends even farther out  and increasing the overall loopiness of the river  However  that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and  short circuit   creating an ox bow lake in the process  The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth   5 2  Memorizing digits  Many persons have memorized large numbers of digits of   a practice called piphilology  One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of   The first word has three letters  the second word has one  the third has four  the fourth has one  the fifth has five  and so on  An early example of a memorization aid  originally devised by English scientist James Jeans  is  How I want a drink  alcoholic of course  after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics   When a poem is used  it is sometimes referred to as a piem  Poems for memorizing have been composed in several languages in addition to English   The record for memorizing digits of   certified by Guinness World Records  is 67 890 digits  recited in China by Lu Chao in 24 hours and 4 minutes on 20 November 2005  In 2006  Akira Haraguchi  a retired Japanese engineer  claimed to have recited 100 000 decimal places  but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records  Record setting memorizers typically do not rely on poems  but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci   A few authors have used the digits of to establish a new form of constrained writing  where the word lengths are required to represent the digits of   The Cadaeic Cadenza contains the first 3835 digits of in this manner  and the full length book Not a Wake contains 10 000 words  each representing one digit of    5 3  In popular culture  Perhaps because of the simplicity of its definition and its ubiquitous presence in formulae  has been represented in popular culture more than other mathematical constructs   In the 2008 Open University and BBC documentary co production  The Story of Maths  aired in October 2008 on BBC Four  British mathematician Marcus du Sautoy shows a visualization of the   historically first exact   formula for calculating the π when visiting India and exploring its contributions to trigonometry   In the Palais de la Découverte  a science museum in Paris  there is a circular room known as the pi room  On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of   The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome like ceiling  The digits were based on an 1853 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks  which included an error beginning at the 528th digit  The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949   In Carl Sagan s novel Contact it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of   The digits of have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song  Pi  from the album Aerial by Kate Bush  and a song by Hard  n Phirm   Many schools in the United States observe Pi Day on 14 March  March is the third month  hence the date is 3 14   and its digital representation are often used by self described  math geeks  for inside jokes among mathematically and technologically minded groups  Several college cheers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include  3 14159    During the 2011 auction for Nortel s portfolio of valuable technology patents  Google made a series of unusually specific bids based on mathematical and scientific constants  including    In 1958 Albert Eagle proposed replacing by    2 to simplify formulas  However  no other authors are known to use tau in this way  Some people use a different value for tau    6 283185      2  arguing that   as the ratio of a circle s circumference to its radius rather than its diameter  is more natural than and simplifies many formulas  Celebrations of this number  because it approximately equals 6 28  by making 28 June  Tau Day  and eating  twice the pie   have been reported in the media  However this use of has not made its way into mainstream mathematics   In 1897  an amateur American mathematician attempted to persuade the Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill  which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for   including 3 2  The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat  The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives  but rejected by the Senate   6  See also  Chronology of computation of π  Proof that π is irrational  Proof that π is transcendental  Mathematical constants and
