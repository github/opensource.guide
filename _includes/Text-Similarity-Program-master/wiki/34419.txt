Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games  with roots drawn from the original genre game  Colossal Cave Adventure  The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP 10 computer  The authors—Tim Anderson  Marc Blank  Bruce Daniels  and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group   When Zork was published commercially  it was split up into three games  Zork  The Great Underground Empire   Part I  later known as Zork I   Zork II  The Wizard of Frobozz  and Zork III  The Dungeon Master   Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game  in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser  which was not limited to simple verb noun commands   hit troll    but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions   hit the troll with the Elvish sword     1  Story  1 1  Setting  Zork is set in  the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground   The player is a nameless adventurer  who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure   The goal is to return from the  Great Underground Empire  alive with the treasures  ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master  The dungeons are stocked with many novel creatures  objects and locations  among them grues  zorkmids  and Flood Control Dam #3—all of which are referenced by subsequent Infocom text adventures   FrobozzCo International is a fictional monopolous conglomerate from the game  FrobozzCo products are littered throughout all Zork games  often with humorous effect   1 2  Plot  1 2 1  Zork I  The game takes place in the Zork calendar year 948 GUE  although the passage of time is not notable in gameplay   The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an  adventurer   The game begins near a white house in a small  self contained area  Although the player is given little instruction  the house provides an obvious point of interest   When the player enters the house  it yields a number of intriguing objects  including an ancient brass lantern  an empty trophy case and an intricately engraved sword  Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar  which is revealed to be one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land known as the Great Underground Empire  The player soon encounters dangerous creatures  including deadly grues  an axe wielding troll  a giant cyclops and a nimble fingered thief who makes mapping the maze difficult by removing any items that the player might drop to leave a trail   The ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case  Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two complex mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3   Placing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of  Master Adventurer   An ancient map with further instructions then magically appears in the trophy case  These instructions provide access to a stone barrow  The entrance to the barrow is the end of Zork I and the beginning of Zork II   It is possible to score all 350 points in 223 moves  and win the game completely in 228 moves  by exploiting a bug   1 2 2  Zork II  The player begins in the Barrow from Zork I armed only with the trusty brass lantern and sword of elvish antiquity  The purpose of the game is not initially clear   The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced  The wizard was once a respected enchanter  but when his powers began to fade he was exiled by Dimwit Flathead  Now bordering on senility  the wizard is still a force to be reckoned with  Your goal  as you venture into the wizard s realm  is to avoid his capricious tricks and learn to control his magic   Like its predecessor  Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt  Unlike the previous game  the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot  Finding the treasures does not end the game  nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game  Instead  the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game s finale   1 2 3  Zork III  The player begins at the bottom of the Endless Stair from Zork II   Zork III is somewhat less of a straightforward treasure hunt than previous installments  Instead  the player舒in the role of the same  adventurer  played in Zork I and Zork II舒must demonstrate worthiness to assume the role of the Dungeon Master   The player must get past the Guardians of Zork  with the complete garb of the Dungeon Master  and then endure a final test  The player must be wearing the amulet  found at the bottom of the lake   the cloak and hood  received when the player chooses to look under the hood of the vanquished opponent in the Land of Shadow rather than deal the final blow   the staff  received from the man at the Cliff for helping him retrieve the chest of valuables  attacking the man in any way or trying to take the valuables from him inevitably breaks the staff   the strange key  found in the Key Room when the player uses the grue repellent  from Zork II  to get past the dark places   the royal ring  retrieved from the Royal Museum by using the gold machine to travel back to the year 776 GUE   and the black book  found in the Royal Puzzle    Unlike Zork I and Zork II there is a time sensitive event  an earthquake which is randomly triggered about 130 turns into gameplay  The player must retrieve the key before the earthquake  when the Aqueduct is broken  leaving no escape route from the Key Room  and can t complete the Royal Puzzle or retrieve the ring until after the earthquake  when the unopenable Great Door breaks   Also unlike the previous two Zork games  the lantern is of little relevance  It is needed only to walk through the dark areas of the Junction  Creepy Crawl and Foggy Room at the beginning of the game  often done after completing the Land of Shadow  Cliff  and Flathead Ocean舒saying  Hello  Sailor  to the Viking yields an invisibility vial舒tasks   Another light source  the torch from the Scenic Vista  is used to retrieve the repellent from Zork II and deposit it in the Damp Passage via the teleportation table to provide a light source for the return journey after retrieving the key   Once the player has all the items  they must give the waybread to the elderly man in the Engravings Room to find the doorway leading to the final hallway  Here the  elvish sword of great antiquity  is used to block the beam in the Beam Room  Next the adventurer must get through the Guardians of Zork  This can either be accomplished by using the complicated Mirror Box or by simply drinking the invisibility potion in the vial from the Flathead Ocean  When the player knocks on the Dungeon Master s door he will only open it if the player is fully equipped  see above   He then tells the adventurer that he will obey their commands  The corridors lead to a parapet which overlooks the fiery cells  Reading the book here reveals a map of  The Dungeon and Treasury of Zork  which has 8 cells  one of which with a bronze door that leads to the Treasury of Zork  The eight positions of the dial in the parapet correspond to the 8 cells  The adventurer must use trial and error at this point to summon the cell with the bronze door and have the dungeon master return it to its original position by replacing it with any other cell  The key will now unlock the door revealing the Treasury of Zork  which contains the wealth of the Great Underground Empire as well as a controlling share in FrobozzCo International  After this victorious discovery  the Dungeon Master appears and transforms the player into a duplicate of himself  signifying the player s succession to his position   2  Commands  In the Zork games  the player is not limited to verb noun commands  such as  take lamp    open mailbox   and so forth  Instead  the parser supports more sophisticated sentences such as  put the lamp and sword in the case    look under the rug   and  drop all except lantern   The game understands many common verbs  including  take    drop    examine    attack    climb    open    close    count   and many more  The games also support commands to the game directly  rather than taking actions within the fictional setting of the game  such as  save  and  restore    script  and  unscript   which begin and end a text transcript of the game text    restart   and  quit    3  Development   Zork  was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program  The implementors briefly named the completed game Dungeon  but changed it back to Zork after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons  Zork has been adapted to a book series   Three of the original Zork programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979  That company adapted the PDP 10 Zork into Zork I III  a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era  including the Apple II  the Commodore 64  the Commodore Plus 4  the Atari 8 bit family  the TRS 80  CP M systems  and the IBM PC  Zork I was published on 5¼  and 8  floppy disks  Joel Berez and Marc Blank developed a specialized virtual machine to run Zork I  called the Z machine  The first  Z machine Interpreter Program  ZIP for a small computer was written by Scott Cutler for the TRS 80  The trilogy was written in ZIL  which stands for  Zork Implementation Language   a language similar to LISP  Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name Zork when it was first released in 1980  but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their subsequent games  Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that  unlike the PDP systems the original ran on  microcomputers did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game  In the process  more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own   3 1  Dungeon  In late 1977 a hacker obtained a copy of the Zork source code  which was subsequently spread  The leaked Zork source code was later used by Bob Supnik  a programmer from Digital Equipment Corporation  to create a Fortran IV port  which allowed the game to run on the smaller DEC PDP 11  In late 1977 the Zork authors had decided to rename Zork to Dungeon  and Supnik subsequently released his port as Dungeon in January 1978  Somewhere in 1978 the Zork developers received notice from Tactical Studies Rules  who claimed that the name Dungeon infringed their trademark rights  and they subsequently changed the name back to Zork  When Zork became a commercial product at Infocom  Infocom agreed that if an Infocom copyright notice was put on the Fortran version  noncommercial distribution would be allowed  This Fortran version  and C translations thereof  have been included in several Linux distributions   The Fortran version of Dungeon was widely available on DEC VAXes  being one of the most popular items distributed by DECUS  It went through multiple modifications both to incorporate more features from the original and to track changes in the MDL version  In the late 1980s  the Fortran version was extensively rewritten for VAX Fortran and became fully compatible with the last MDL release  It had one extra joke  an apparent entrance to the Mill  a reference to DEC s headquarters  that was  in fact  impassable   It also had a gdt command  game debugging technique  a reference to the DDT debugger  which enabled the player to move any object  including the player  to any room  Use of gdt required answering a random question requiring deep knowledge of the game  The game s response to a wrong answer  “A booming voice says ‘Wrong  cretin ’ and you notice that you have turned into a pile of dust”  appears in many  fortune cookie  databases   The Fortran version was also included in the distribution media for some Data General operating systems  It was used as an acceptance test to verify that the OS had been correctly installed  Being able to compile  link  and run the program demonstrated that all of the run time libraries  compiler  and link editor were installed in the correct locations   4  Releases  The original version of Zork I was published by Personal Software and simply called Zork  It was distributed in clear plastic bags containing only the game disk and a 36 page booklet  Infocom s first  self published  version of Zork I was in the so called  Folio  format which included a single piece of paper describing how to run the game  The feelies noted above were only introduced when Zork I was re released in the  Grey box  format   Zork I was one of five Infocom games that were re released in Solid Gold format with in game hints   There is also an abridged version  called Mini Zork I  dated November 24  1987  It was released free of charge as a promotion   A German language version was developed  but never released  An unfinished version of this story file  dated January 13  1988  has made its way into public circulation  The German is evidently non native  containing many spelling and grammar errors  It is known that Jeff O Neill worked on this version   A remastered version of Zork I  The Underground Empire  name in Japan Zork I 大きい地下帝国    was released by Activision for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996  This Japanese version includes graphics  sound effects  auto mapping  and music by Yuzo Koshiro  This version was never released outside Japan  It was also included in Call of Duty  Black Ops—there is an easter egg where players can escape the chair at the title screen and walk around  where the full game can be played at a terminal computer found in the room   5  Feelies  Infocom did not begin their tradition of including feelies  or extra items related to a game  until the release Deadline  Later re releases of the game  however  were packaged with   The booklet The Great Underground Empire  A History  by  Froboz Mumbar   A map roughly corresponding to a portion of the game s area Although the back of the Zork I  Grey box  depicted a zorkmid coin included with the other feelies  production difficulties led to the coins  omission from the packages  Zorkmid coins were not included as feelies until the release of the Zork Trilogy boxed set   6  Reception  6 1  Zork I  BYTE declared in 1981 that  No single advance in the science of Adventure has been as bold and exciting  as Zork  The magazine praised the sophisticated parser and quality of writing  stating   That the program is entertaining  eloquent  witty  and precisely written is almost beside the point     Zork can be felt and touched—experienced  if you will—through the care and attention to detail the authors have rendered   It concluded   Somebody  please  let me know when  the sequel is  done   Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in 1983 that he played the game with his sons  stating that  If you liked Adventure and wanted more after you solved the Colossal Cave  I guarantee you ll love Zork   In 1992  Computer Gaming World added the game to its Hall of Fame  waiving the normal criteria  in favor of honoring this venerable classic    Zork I was the best selling game of 1982  with 32 000 copies sold by the first half of that year  Its sales surprised Infocom by rising  not falling  over time  many dealers sold the game as an essential accessory to those purchasing new computers  The company sold almost 100 000 copies in 1983  more than 150 000 copies in 1984  comprising more than 20% of Infocom s sales that year  and a total of 378 987 copies by 1986   6 2  Zork II  Softline praised the game s well balanced mix of humor  wit  and wry puns   The magazine warned of its difficulty  but concluded that  Zork II is recommended to any novice or master adventurer who wants a feeling of satisfaction upon completion of a well thought out and imaginative adventure   PC Magazine stated that  Zork IIs appeal is universal  and that the game was  a challenge  It is interesting  difficult  frustrating  and most of all  enjoyable  For those who have plenty of time  the game is endlessly amusing    7  Legacy  7 1  Sequels  The Enchanter trilogy   Enchanter  1983  Infocom   Sorcerer  1984  Infocom

Michael Berlyn and Marc Blank  original Infocom implementors  and released by Activision to promote the release of Zork Grand Inquisitor   Zork Grand Inquisitor  1997  Activision  The Enchanter trilogy and Wishbringer occupy somewhat unusual positions within the Zork universe  Enchanter was originally developed as Zork IV  Infocom decided to instead release it separately  however  and it became the basis of a new trilogy   In each trilogy  there is a sense of assumed continuity  that is  the player s character in Zork III is assumed to have experienced the events of Zork I and Zork II  Similarly  events from Enchanter are referenced in Sorcerer and Spellbreaker  but the Enchanter character is not assumed to be the same one from the Zork trilogy  In fact  in Enchanter the player s character encounters the Adventurer from Zork  who helps the player s character solve a puzzle in the game   Although Wishbringer was never officially linked to the Zork series  the game is generally agreed to be  Zorkian  due to its use of magic and several terms and names from established Zork games   7 2  Parodies  A parody titled Pork  The Great Underground Sewer System was also released   7 3
