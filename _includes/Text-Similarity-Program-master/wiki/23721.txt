Peter Albert David Singer  AC  born 6 July 1946  is an Australian moral philosopher  He is currently the Ira W  DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University  and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne  He specializes in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular  utilitarian perspective  He is known in particular for his book  Animal Liberation  1975   a canonical text in animal rights liberation theory  For most his career  he supported preference utilitarianism  but in his later years became a classical or hedonistic utilitarian  when co authoring The Point of View of the Universe with Katarzyna de Lazari Radek   On two occasions Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at Monash University  where he founded its Centre for Human Bioethics  In 1996 he stood unsuccessfully as a Greens candidate for the Australian Senate  In 2004 he was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies  and in June 2012 was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to philosophy and bioethics  He serves on the Advisory Board of Incentives for Global Health  the NGO formed to develop the Health Impact Fund proposal  He was voted one of Australia s ten most influential public intellectuals in 2006  Singer currently serves on the advisory board of Academics Stand Against Poverty  ASAP    1  Life and career  Singer s parents were Viennese Jews who emigrated to Australia from Vienna in 1938  after Austria s annexation by Nazi Germany  They settled in Melbourne  where Singer was born  His grandparents were less fortunate  his paternal grandparents were taken by the Nazis to Łódź  and were never heard from again  his maternal grandfather died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp  He has a sister  Joan  now Joan Dwyer   Singer s grandfather  David Oppenheim  published numerous papers with Sigmund Freud before a falling out between the two in Venice  Singer s father imported tea and coffee  while his mother practiced medicine  He attended Preshil and later Scotch College  After leaving school  Singer studied law  history and philosophy at the University of Melbourne  gaining his BA degree  hons  in 1967  He received an MA for a thesis entitled Why should I be moral  in 1969  He was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford  and obtained from there a B Phil in 1971  with a thesis on civil disobedience supervised by R  M  Hare and subsequently published as a book in 1973  Singer names Hare and Australian philosopher H  J  McCloskey as his two most important mentors   After spending two years as a Radcliffe lecturer at University College  Oxford  he was a visiting professor at New York University for 16 months  He returned to Melbourne in 1977  where he spent most of his career  aside from appointments as visiting faculty abroad  until his move to Princeton in 1999  In June 2011 it was announced he would join the professoriate of New College of the Humanities  a private college in London  in addition to his work at Princeton   According to philosopher Helga Kuhse  Singer is  almost certainly the best known and most widely read of all contemporary philosophers   Michael Specter wrote that Singer is among the most influential of contemporary philosophers   2  Animal Liberation  Published in 1975  Animal Liberation has been cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement  The central argument of the book is an expansion of the utilitarian idea that  the greatest good of the greatest number  is the only measure of good or ethical behaviour  Singer believes that there is no reason not to apply this to other animals  arguing that the boundary between human and ‘animal’ is completely arbitrary  There are more differences between a great ape and an oyster  for example  than between a human and a great ape  and yet the former two are lumped together as ‘animals’ whilst we are ‘human’   In particular  he argues that while animals show lower intelligence than the average human  many severely intellectually challenged humans show equally diminished  if not lower  mental capacity  and that some animals have displayed signs of intelligence sometimes on par with that of human children  Singer therefore argues intelligence does not provide a basis for providing nonhuman animals any less consideration than such intellectually challenged humans   He popularized the term  speciesism   which was originally coined by Richard D  Ryder  to describe the practice of privileging humans over other animals   3  Applied ethics  Singer s most comprehensive work  Practical Ethics  1979   analyzes in detail why and how living beings  interests should be weighed  His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests  since different interests warrant different treatment  All have an interest in avoiding pain  for instance  but relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities  Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests  but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing marginal utility is a factor  For example  this approach would privilege a starving person s interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry   Among the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain  in developing one s abilities  in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter  in enjoying warm personal relationships  in being free to pursue one s projects without interference   and many others   The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for  suffering and or enjoyment or happiness   Singer holds that a being s interests should always be weighed according to that being s concrete properties  He favors a  journey  model of life  which measures the wrongness of taking a life by the degree to which doing so frustrates a life journey s goals  The journey model is tolerant of some frustrated desire and explains why persons who have embarked on their journeys are not replaceable  Only a personal interest in continuing to live brings the journey model into play  This model also explains the priority that Singer attaches to interests over trivial desires and pleasures   Singer s ideas require the concept of an impartial standpoint from which to compare interests  He has wavered about whether the precise aim is the total amount of satisfied interests or the most satisfied interests among those beings who already exist prior to the decision making  The second edition of Practical Ethics disavows the first edition s suggestion that the total and prior existence views should be combined  The second edition asserts that preference satisfaction utilitarianism  incorporating the  journey  model  applies without invoking the first edition s suggestion about the total view  The details are fuzzy  however  and Singer admits that he is  not entirely satisfied  with his treatment   Ethical conduct is justifiable by reasons that go beyond prudence to  something bigger than the individual   addressing a larger audience  Singer thinks this going beyond identifies moral reasons as  somehow universal   specifically in the injunction to  love thy neighbor as thyself   interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one s own interests  This universalising step  which Singer traces from Kant to Hare  is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists  from Hobbes to David Gauthier  who tie morality to prudence  Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism  Singer argues  on the strength of the thought that one s own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others  Taking these into account  one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected  utilitarianism has been arrived at  Singer s universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them  whereas a Kantian s applies to the judgments of rational agents  in Kant s kingdom of ends  or Rawls s Original Position  etc    Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals  As for the Hobbesians  Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of Practical Ethics  arguing that self interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view  such as  the paradox of hedonism   which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it  and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns   Practical Ethics includes a chapter arguing for the redistribution of wealth to ameliorate absolute poverty  Chapter 8   Rich and Poor    and another making a case for resettlement of refugees on a large scale in industrialised countries  Chapter 9   Insiders and Outsiders     Although the natural  non sentient environment has no intrinsic value for a utilitarian like Singer  environmental degradation is a profound threat to sentient life  and for this reason he states that environmentalists are right to speak of wilderness as a  world heritage    3 1  Euthanasia and infanticide  Consistent with his general ethical theory  Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being s capacity to hold preferences  which in turn is essentially tied to a being s capacity to feel pain and pleasure  Critics such as Laing hold that this view is subject to charges of inconsistency  equivocation and contradiction   Similar to his argument for abortion  Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood— rationality  autonomy  and self consciousness —and therefore  killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person  that is  a being who wants to go on living    Singer classifies euthanasia as voluntary  involuntary  or non voluntary  Voluntary euthanasia is that to which the subject consents   Singer s book Rethinking Life and Death  The Collapse of Our Traditional Ethics offers further examination of the ethical dilemmas concerning the advances of medicine  He covers the value of human life and quality of life ethics in addition to abortion and other controversial ethical questions   Religious critics have argued that Singer s ethic ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the sanctity of life  whereas bioethics associated with the Disability Rights and Disability Studies communities have argued that his epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability  Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated  unscientific and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics   Singer has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life  His mother had Alzheimer s disease  He said   I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult   In an interview with Ronald Bailey  published in December 2000  he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother  He did say that  if he were solely responsible  his mother might not continue to live   3 2  Abortion  In Singer s view  the central argument against abortion may be stated as the following syllogism   In his book Rethinking Life and Death  as well as in Practical Ethics  Singer asserts that  if we take the premises at face value  the argument is deductively valid  Singer comments that defenders of abortion attack the second premise  suggesting that the fetus becomes a  human  or  alive  at some point after conception  however  Singer finds this argument flawed in that human development is a gradual process  and it is nearly impossible to mark a particular moment in time as the moment at which human life begins   Singer s argument for abortion differs from many other proponents of abortion  then  rather than attacking the second premise of the anti abortion argument  Singer attacks the first premise  denying that it is necessarily wrong to take innocent human life    The argument that a fetus is not alive  is a resort to a convenient fiction that turns an evidently living being into one that legally is not alive  Instead of accepting such fictions  we should recognise that the fact that a being is human  and alive  does not in itself tell us whether it is wrong to take that being s life  Singer states that arguments for or against abortion should be based on utilitarian calculation which compares the preferences of a woman against the preferences of the fetus  In his view a preference is anything sought to be obtained or avoided  all forms of benefit or harm caused to a being correspond directly with the satisfaction or frustration of one or more of its preferences  Since a capacity to experience the sensations of suffering or satisfaction is a prerequisite to having any preferences at all  and a fetus  up to around eighteen weeks  says Singer  has no capacity to suffer or feel satisfaction  it is not possible for such a fetus to hold any preferences at all  In a utilitarian calculation  there is nothing to weigh against a woman s preferences to have an abortion  therefore  abortion is morally permissible   Singer s book Rethinking Life and Death  The Collapse of Our Traditional Ethics offers further examination of the ethical dilemmas concerning the advances of medicine  He covers the value of human life and quality of life ethics in addition to abortion and other controversial ethical questions   Religious critics have argued that Singer s ethic ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the sanctity of life  whereas bioethics associated with the Disability Rights and Disability Studies communities have argued that his epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability  Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated  unscientific and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics   Singer has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life  His mother had Alzheimer s disease  He said   I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult   In an interview with Ronald Bailey  published in December 2000  he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother  He did say that  if he were solely responsible  his mother might not continue to live   3 3  World poverty  In  Famine  Affluence  and Morality   one of Singer s best known philosophical essays  he argues that some people living in abundance while others starve is morally indefensible  Singer proposes that anyone able to help the poor should donate part of their income to aid poverty relief and similar efforts  Singer reasons that  when one is already living comfortably  a further purchase to increase comfort will lack the same moral importance as saving another person s life  Singer himself reports that he donates around 33% of his salary to a variety of cost effective charities  and he is a member of Giving What We Can  an international society for the promotion of poverty relief inspired by Singer s arguments  In  Rich and Poor   the version of the aforementioned article that appears in the second edition of Practical Ethics  his main argument is presented as follows   If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable significance  we ought to do it  absolute poverty is bad  there is some poverty we can prevent without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance  therefore we ought to prevent some absolute poverty  Singer s most recent book  The Life You Can Save  makes the argument that it is a clear cut moral imperative for citizens of developed countries to give more to charitable causes that help the poor  While Singer acknowledges that there are problems with ensuring that money goes where it is most needed and that it is used effectively  he does not think that these practical difficulties undermine his original conclusion  that people should make a much greater effort to reduce poverty    3 4  Other views  3 4 1  Doping in elite sports  Singer agrees with Julian Savulescu that elite athletes should be allowed to take whatever performance enhancing drugs they wish   as long as it is safe for them to do so   The argument is that   without drugs  those with the best genes have an unfair advantage        Setting a maximum level of red blood cells  for endurance events  actually levels the playing field by reducing the impact of the genetic lottery  Effort then becomes more important than having the right genes    3 4 2  Evolutionary biology and leftist politics  In A Darwinian Left  Singer outlines a plan for the political left to adapt to the lessons of evolutionary biology  He says that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self interested  He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is  right   He concludes that game theory  the mathematical study of strategy  and experiments in psychology offer hope that self interested people will make short term sacrifices for the good of others  if society provides the right conditions  Essentially Singer claims that although humans possess selfish  competitive tendencies naturally  they have a substantial capacity for cooperation that has also been selected for during human evolution  Singer s writing in Greater Good magazine  published by the Greater Good Science Center of the University of California  Berkeley  includes the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion  altruism  and peaceful human relationships   Nonetheless  he claims not to be anti capitalist  In an interview with New Left Project in 2010  he said the following   Capitalism is very far from a perfect system  but so far we have yet to find anything that clearly does a better job of meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy  He then adds that  If we ever do find a better system  I ll be happy to call myself an anti capitalist    3 4 3  Personism  Although he has expressed admiration for many of the values promoted by secular humanism  Singer believes it to be incomplete and promotes a preference utilitarian view he calls  personism  instead   3 4 4  Surrogacy  In 1985  Singer wrote a book with the physician Deanne Wells arguing that surrogate motherhood should be allowed and regulated by the state by establishing non profit  State Surrogacy Boards   which would ensure fairness between surrogate mothers and surrogacy seeking parents  Singer and Wells endorsed both the payment of medical expenses endured by surrogate mothers and an extra  fair fee  to compensate the surrogate mother   3 4 5  Vegetarianism and ethics of food consumption  In an article for the online publication Chinadialogue  Singer called Western style meat production cruel  unhealthy and damaging to the ecosystem  He rejected the idea that the method was necessary to meet the population s increasing demand  explaining that animals in factory farms have to eat food grown explicitly for them  and they burn up most of the food s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm   Singer calls himself a vegetarian and a  flexible vegan   In his May 2006 interview in Mother Jones  he states   I don t eat meat  I ve been a vegetarian since 1971  I ve gradually become increasingly vegan  I am largely vegan but I m a flexible vegan  I don t go to the supermarket and buy non vegan stuff for myself  But when I m traveling or going to other people s places I will be quite happy to eat vegetarian rather than vegan  In addition to his addressing issues concerning the consumption of animal products  Singer s  Can You Do Good by Eating Well   in Greater Good examines the ethics of eating locally grown food   3 4 6  Bestiality  In a 2001 review of Midas Dekkers  Dearest Pet  On Bestiality  Singer argues that sexual activities between humans and animals that result in harm to the animal should remain illegal  but that  sex with animals does not always involve cruelty  and that  mutually satisfying activities  of a sexual nature may sometimes occur between humans and animals  and that writer Otto Soyka would condone such activities  This position is countered by fellow philosopher Tom Regan  who writes that the same argument could be used to justify having sex with children  Regan writes that Singer s position is a consequence of his adapting a utilitarian  or consequentialist  approach to animal rights  rather than a strictly rights based one  and argues that the rights based position distances itself from non consensual sex  The Humane Society of the United States takes the position that all sexual molestation of animals by humans is abusive  whether it involves physical injury or not   Commenting on Singer s article  Heavy Petting   in which he argues that zoosexual activity need not be abusive  and that relationships could form which were mutually enjoyed  Ingrid Newkirk  president of the animal rights group PETA  argued that   If a girl gets sexual pleasure from riding a horse  does the horse suffer  If not  who cares  If you French kiss your dog and he or she thinks it s great  is it wrong  We believe all exploitation and abuse is wrong  If it isn t exploitation and abuse   then  it may not be wrong   A few years later  Newkirk clarified in a letter to the Canada Free Press that she was strongly opposed to any exploitation of  and all sexual activity with  animals   3 4 7  Religion  Singer is an atheist  He was a speaker at the 2012 Global Atheist Convention  He has debated with Christians such as John Lennox and Dinesh D Souza  In his debate with Dinesh D Souza  he claims that while other conceptions of a god or gods could be argued to exist  the Judeo Christian conception almost certainly cannot  In keeping with his considerations of non human animals  Singer also takes issue with the free will reply to the problem of evil  saying that   What about the suffering of non human animals      not even Christians believe that they suffer from original sin    3 4 8  Death penalty  Singer is opposed to the death penalty  claiming that it does not effectively deter the crimes for which it is the punitive measure and that he cannot see any other justification for it   3 5  Criticism of Singer  Singer s positions have been criticised by groups  such as advocates for disabled people and right to life supporters  concerned with what they see as his attacks upon human dignity  Singer has replied that many people judge him based on secondhand summaries and short quotations taken out of context  not his books or articles   Some claim that Singer s utilitarian ideas lead to eugenics  American publisher Steve Forbes ceased his donations to Princeton University in 1999 because of Singer s appointment to a prestigious professorship  Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that  A professor of morals     who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns     is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level   Marc Maurer  President of the National Federation of the Blind  criticised Singer s appointment to the Princeton Faculty in a banquet speech at the organisation s national convention in July 2001  claiming that Singer s support for euthanizing disabled babies could lead to disabled older children and adults being valued less as well  Conservative psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is  preposterous—psychologically  theoretically  and practically    Singer s work has attracted criticism from other philosophers  Bernard Williams  who was a critic of utilitarianism  said of Singer that he  is always so keen to mortify himself and tell everyone how to live   Williams criticised Singer s ethic by saying that he s  always so damn logical  and thus  leaves out an entire dimension of value   Williams claimed that Singer s utilitarianism is impractical as it s impossible to  make these calculations and comparisons in real life    Williams develops an extended critique of Singer for suggesting that  speciesism  is a prejudice roughly equivalent to sexism or racism by suggesting that we have yet to face the sort of scenarios where species membership would become a morally significant property  but that some science fiction style thought experiments may provide such examples  He imagines an invasion of aliens that are  very disgusting indeed  their faces  for instance  if those are faces  are seething with what seem to be worms  but if we wait long enough to find out what they are at  we may gather that they are quite benevolent   Said aliens  want to live with us—rather closely with us  even though their  disgustingness is really  truly  unforgettable   Williams also suggests that another sort of alien visitors might have  much more successful experience than we have in running peacable societies  but that they would need to exercise significant control and remove the cultural autonomy of human beings  In both scenarios  Williams argues  it would be perfectly reasonable for human beings to treat their species membership as a reasonable morally significant property  Singer responds to Williams by arguing that the right and courageous thing to do is to make the decision without regards to species   The aesthetics philosopher Roger Scruton wrote in 2000   Singer s works  remarkably for a philosophy professor  contain little or no philosophical argument  They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals    In 2002 disability rights activist Harriet McBryde Johnson debated Singer  challenging his belief that parents ought to be able to euthanize their disabled children      Johnson s account of her encounters with Singer and the pro euthanasia movement  was published in the New York Times Magazine in 2003  It also served as inspiration for The Thrill  a 2013 play by Judith Thompson partly based on Johnson s life   3 5 1  Protests  In 1989 and 1990  Peter Singer s work was the subject of a number of protests in Germany  A course in ethics led by Dr Hartmut Kliemt at the University of Duisburg where the main text used was Singer s Practical Ethics was  according to Singer   subjected to organized and repeated disruption by protesters objecting to the use of the book on the grounds that in one of its ten chapters it advocates active euthanasia for severely disabled newborn infants   The protests led to the course being shut down   When Singer tried to speak during a lecture at Saarbrücken  he was interrupted by a group of protesters including advocates for the disabled  He offered the protesters the opportunity to explain why he should not be allowed to speak  The protesters indicated that they believed he was opposed to all rights for the disabled  They were unaware that  although Singer believes that some lives are so blighted from the beginning that their parents may decide their lives are not worth living  in other cases  once the decision is made to keep them alive  everything that can be done to improve the quality of their life should  to Singer s mind  be done  The ensuing discussion revealed that there were many misconceptions about his positions  but the revelation did not end the controversy  One of the protesters expressed that entering serious discussions was a tactical error   The same year  Singer was invited to speak in Marburg at a European symposium on  Bioengineering  Ethics and Mental Disability   The invitation was fiercely attacked by leading intellectuals and organizations in German media  with an article in Der Spiegel comparing Singer s positions to Nazism  The symposium was eventually cancelled and Singer s invitation consequently withdrawn   A lecture at the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich was also interrupted by two groups of protesters  The first group was a group of disabled people who staged a brief protest at the beginning of the lecture  They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak  At the end of this protest  when Singer tried to address their concerns  a second group of protesters rose and began chanting  Singer raus  Singer raus     Singer out    When Singer attempted to respond  a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses  and the host ended the lecture  The first group of protesters was distressed by this second  more aggressive group  It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer  Singer explains  my views are not threatening to anyone  even minimally  and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying  given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust  if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system   In 1991  Singer was due to speak along with R  M  Hare and Georg Meggle at the 15th International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel  Austria  Singer has stated that threats were made to Adolf Hübner  then the president of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society  that the conference would be disrupted if Singer and Meggle were given a platform  Hübner proposed to the board of the society that Singer s invitation  as well as the invitations of a number of other speakers  be withdrawn  The Society decided to cancel the symposium   In an article originally published in The New York Review of Books  Singer argued that the protests dramatically increased the amount of coverage he got   instead of a few hundred people hearing views at lectures in Marburg and Dortmund  several millions read about them or listened to them on television   Despite this  Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate  with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak   4  Meta ethics and foundational issues  Though Singer focuses more than many philosophers on applied ethical questions  he has also written in depth on foundational issues in meta ethics  including why one ethical system should be chosen over others  In The Expanding Circle  he argues that the evolution of human society provides support for the utilitarian point of view  On his account  ethical reasoning has existed from the time primitive foraging bands had to cooperate  compromise  and make group decisions to survive  He elaborates   In a dispute between members of a cohesive group of reasoning beings  the demand for a reason is a demand for a justification that can be accepted by the group as a whole   Thus  consideration of others  interests has long been a necessary part of the human experience  Singer believes that contemplative analysis may now guide one to accept a broader utilitarianism   If I have seen that from an ethical point of view I am just one person among the many in my society  and my interests are no more important  from the point of view of the whole  than the similar interests of others within my society  I am ready to see that  from a still larger point of view  my society is just one among other societies  and the interests of members of my society are no more important  from that larger perspective  than the similar interests of members of other societies    Taking the impartial element in ethical reasoning to its logical conclusion means  first  accepting that we ought to have equal concern for all human beings  Singer elaborates that viewing oneself as equal to others in one s society and at the same time viewing one s society as fundamentally superior to other societies may cause an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance  This is the sense in which he means that reason may push people to accept a broader utilitarian stance  Critics like Ken Binmore say that this cognitive dissonance is apparently not very strong  since people often knowingly ignore the interests of faraway societies quite similar to their own  and that the  ought  above only applies if one already accepts Singer s basic premises about the equality of various interests  An alternative line taken by Singer about the need for ethics is that living the ethical life may be  on the whole  more satisfying than seeking only material gain  He invokes the hedonistic paradox  noting that those who pursue material gain seldom find the happiness they seek  Having a broader purpose in life may lead to more long term happiness  On this account  impartial  self sacrificing  behavior in particular matters may be motivated by self interested considerations from a broader perspective   Singer has also implicitly argued that an airtight defense of utilitarianism is not crucial to his work  In  Famine  Affluence  and Morality   he begins by saying that he would like to see how far a seemingly innocuous and widely endorsed principle can take us  the principle is that one is morally required to forgo a small pleasure to relieve someone else s immense pain  He then argues that this principle entails radical conclusions—for example  that affluent people are very immoral if they do not give up some luxury goods to donate the money for famine relief  If his reasoning is valid  he goes on to argue  either it is not very immoral to value small luxuries over saving many lives  or such affluent people are very immoral  As Singer argues in the same essay  regardless of the soundness of his fundamental defense of utilitarianism  his argument has value in that it exposes conflicts between many people s stated beliefs and their actions   5  Honours  Singer was inducted into the United States Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2000   On 11 June 2012  Singer was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for  eminent service to philosophy and bioethics as a leader of public debate and communicator of ideas in the areas of global poverty  animal welfare and the human condition    6  Personal life  Since 1968 he has been married to Renata née Diamond  they have three children  Ruth  Marion and Esther  Renata Singer is a novelist and author in her own right  and has also collaborated on publications with her husband   7  Publications  7
