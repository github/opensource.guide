Paul Jackson Pollock  January 28  1912 舑 August 11  1956   known as Jackson Pollock  was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement  He was well known for his unique style of drip painting   During his lifetime  Pollock enjoyed considerable fame and notoriety  a major artist of his generation  Regarded as reclusive  he had a volatile personality  and struggled with alcoholism for most of his life  In 1945  he married the artist Lee Krasner  who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy   Pollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol related single car accident when he was driving  In December 1956  several months after his death  Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art  MoMA  in New York City  A larger  more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967  In 1998 and 1999  his work was honored with large scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London   1  Early life  Pollock was born in Cody  Wyoming  in 1912  the youngest of five sons  His parents  Stella May  née McClure  and LeRoy Pollock  were born and grew up in Tingley  Iowa and were educated at Tingley High School  Pollock s mother is interred at Tingley Cemetery  Ringgold County  Iowa  His father had been born with the surname McCoy but took the surname of his adoptive parents  neighbors who adopted him after his own parents had died within a year of each other  Stella and LeRoy Pollock were Presbyterian  they were of Irish and Scots Irish descent  respectively  LeRoy Pollock was a farmer and later a land surveyor for the government  moving for different jobs  Jackson grew up in Arizona and Chico  California   While living in Echo Park  California  he enrolled at Los Angeles  Manual Arts High School  from which he was expelled  He already had been expelled in 1928 from another high school  During his early life  Pollock explored Native American culture while on surveying trips with his father   In 1930  following his older brother Charles Pollock  he moved to New York City  where they both studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League  Benton s rural American subject matter had little influence on Pollock s work  but his rhythmic use of paint and his fierce independence were more lasting  In the early 1930s Pollock spent a summer touring the Western United States together with Glen Rounds  a fellow art student  and Benton  their teacher   From 1938 to 1942  during the Great Depression  Pollock worked for the WPA Federal Art Project   Trying to deal with his established alcoholism  from 1938 through 1941 Pollock underwent Jungian psychotherapy with Dr  Joseph Henderson and later with Dr  Violet Staub de Laszlo in 1941 1942  Henderson engaged him through his art  encouraging Pollock to make drawings  Jungian concepts and archetypes were expressed in his paintings  Recently historians have hypothesized that Pollock might have had bipolar disorder   2  Springs period and his technique  Pollock signed a gallery contract with Peggy Guggenheim in July 1943  He received the commission to create Mural  1943   which measures roughly 8 feet tall by 20 feet long  for the entry to her new townhouse  At the suggestion of her friend and advisor Marcel Duchamp  Pollock painted the work on canvas  rather than the wall  so that it would be portable  After seeing the big mural  the art critic Clement Greenberg wrote   I took one look at it and I thought   Now that s great art   and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced    2 1  Marriage and family  In October 1945  Pollock married the American painter Lee Krasner  In November they moved out of the city to the Springs area of East Hampton on the south shore of Long Island  With the help of a down payment loaned by Peggy Guggenheim  they bought a wood frame house and barn at 830 Springs Fireplace Road  Pollock converted the barn into a studio  In that space  he perfected his big  drip  technique of working with paint  with which he would become permanently identified   3  New techniques  Pollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop in New York City by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros  He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s  such as Male and Female and Composition with Pouring I  After his move to Springs  he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor  and he developed what was later called his  drip  technique   He started using synthetic resin based paints called alkyd enamels  which  at that time  was a novel medium  Pollock described this use of household paints  instead of artist’s paints  as  a natural growth out of a need   He used hardened brushes  sticks  and even basting syringes as paint applicators  Pollock s technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term action painting  With this technique  Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art  the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas  By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface  he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions   A possible influence on Pollock was the work of the Ukrainian American artist Janet Sobel  1894–1968   born Jennie Lechovsky   Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel s work in her The Art of This Century Gallery in 1945  With Jackson Pollock  the critic Clement Greenberg saw Sobel s work there in 1946  In his essay  American Type Painting   Greenberg noted those works were the first of all over painting he had seen  and said that  Pollock admitted that these pictures had made an impression on him    While painting this way  Pollock moved away from figurative representation  and challenged the Western tradition of using easel and brush  He used the force of his whole body to paint  which was expressed on the large canvases  In 1956  Time magazine dubbed Pollock  Jack the Dripper   due to his painting style   Pollock observed American Indian sandpainting demonstrations in the 1940s  Referring to his style of painting on the floor  Pollock stated  “I feel nearer  more a part of the painting  since this way I can walk round it  work from the four sides and literally be in the painting  This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West ” Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism  Pollock denied reliance on  the accident   he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear  His technique combined the movement of his body  over which he had control  the viscous flow of paint  the force of gravity  and the absorption of paint into the canvas  It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors  Flinging  dripping  pouring  and spattering  he would move energetically around the canvas  almost as if in a dance  and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see   In 1950  Hans Namuth  a young photographer  wanted to take pictures  both stills and moving  of Pollock at work  Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session  but when Namuth arrived  Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished   Namuth s said that when he entered the studio   In the 21st century  the physicists Richard Taylor  Adam Micolich and David Jonas studied Pollock s works and technique  They determined that some works display the properties of mathematical fractals although this could not be replicated by others  They assert that the works expressed more fractal qualities as Pollock progressed in his career  The authors speculate that Pollock may have had an intuition of the nature of chaotic motion  and tried to express mathematical chaos  more than ten years before  Chaos Theory  was proposed  Their work was used in trying to evaluate the authenticity of some works that were represented as Pollock s   Other contemporary experts have suggested that Pollock may have imitated popular theories of the time in order to give his paintings a depth not previously seen   4  1950s  Pollock s most famous paintings were made during the  drip period  between 1947 and 1950  He rocketed to fame following an August 8  1949 four page spread in Life magazine that asked   Is he the greatest living painter in the United States   At the peak of his fame  Pollock abruptly abandoned the drip style   Pollock s work after 1951 was darker in color  including a collection painted in black on unprimed canvases  He later returned to using color and reintroduced figurative elements  During this period  Pollock had moved to a more commercial gallery  there was great demand for his work from collectors  In response to this pressure  along with personal frustration  his alcoholism deepened   5  From naming to numbering  Continuing to evade the viewer s search for figurative elements in his paintings  Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works  He said about this      look passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for   Pollock s wife  Lee Krasner  said Pollock  used to give his pictures conventional titles    but now he simply numbers them  Numbers are neutral  They make people look at a picture for what it is—pure painting    6  Death  In 1955  Pollock painted Scent and Search  his last two paintings  He did not paint at all in 1956  but was making sculptures at Tony Smith’s home  constructions of wire  gauze  and plaster  Shaped by sand casting  they have heavily textured surfaces similar to what Pollock often created in his paintings   On August 11  1956  at 10 15 pm  Pollock died in a single car crash in his Oldsmobile convertible while driving under the influence of alcohol  One of the passengers  Edith Metzger  was also killed in the accident  which occurred less than a mile from Pollock s home  The other passenger  Ruth Kligman  an artist and Pollock s mistress  survived   For the rest of her life  his widow Lee Krasner managed his estate and ensured that Pollock s reputation remained strong despite changing art world trends  The couple are buried in Green River Cemetery in Springs with a large boulder marking his grave and a smaller one marking hers   7  Legacy  The Pollock Krasner House and Studio is owned and administered by the Stony Brook Foundation  a non profit affiliate of Stony Brook University  Regular tours of the house and studio occur from May through October   A separate organization  the Pollock Krasner Foundation  was established in 1985  The Foundation functions as the official Estate for both Pollock and his widow Lee Krasner  but also  under the terms of Krasner s will  serves  to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need   The U S  copyright representative for the Pollock Krasner Foundation is the Artists Rights Society  ARS    Lee Krasner donated his papers in 1983 to the Archives of American Art  They were later archived with Lee Krasner s papers  The Archives of American Art also houses the Charles Pollock Papers  which includes correspondence  photographs  and other files relating to his brother Jackson Pollock   8  Authenticity issues  The Pollock Krasner Authentication Board was created by the Pollock Krasner Foundation in 1990 to evaluate newly found works for an upcoming supplement to the 1978 catalogue  In the past  however  the Pollock Krasner Foundation has declined to be involved in authentication cases   In 2003  twenty four Pollock esque paintings and drawings were found in a locker in Wainscott  New York  An inconclusive debate continues about whether or not these works are Pollock originals  Physicists have argued over whether fractals can be used to authenticate the paintings  This would require an analysis of geometric consistency of the paint splatters in Pollock s work at a microscopic level  and would be measured against the finding that patterns in Pollock s paintings increased in complexity with time  Analysis of the paintings by researchers at Harvard University showed the presence in one painting of a synthetic pigment that was not patented until the 1980s  and materials in two others that were not available in Pollock s lifetime  In 2007 a traveling museum exhibition of the paintings was mounted and was accompanied by a comprehensive book  Pollock Matters written by Ellen G  Landau  one of the four sitting scholars from the former Pollock Krasner Foundation authentication panel from the 1990s and Claude Cernuschi  a scholar in Abstract Expressionism  In the book  Ellen Landau demonstrates the many connections between the family that owns the paintings and Jackson Pollock during his lifetime in order to place the paintings in what she believes to be their proper historic context  Landau also presents the forensic findings of Harvard University and presents possible explanations for the forensic inconsistencies that were found in three of the 24 paintings   In 2006 a documentary  Who the *$&% Is Jackson Pollock  was made concerning Teri Horton  a truck driver who in 1992 bought an abstract painting for five dollars at a thrift store in California  This work may be a lost Pollock painting but its authenticity is debated   Untitled 1950  which the New York based Knoedler Gallery had sold in 2007 for $17 million to Pierre Lagrange  a London hedge fund multi millionaire  was subject to an authenticity suit before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  Done in the painter’s classic drip and splash style and signed “J  Pollock ” the modest size painting  15 inches by 281 1 2 inches  was found to contain yellow paint pigments not commercially available until about 1970  The suit was settled in a confidential agreement in 2012   9  In pop culture and media  In 1960  Ornette Coleman s album Free Jazz  A Collective Improvisation featured a Pollock painting as its cover artwork   The British indie band The Stone Roses were heavily influenced by Pollock  they have cover artwork made of pastiches of his work   In the early 1990s  three groups of movie makers were developing Pollock biographical projects  each based on a different source  The project that at first seemed most advanced was a joint venture between Barbra Streisand s Barwood Films and Robert De Niro s TriBeCa Productions  De Niro s parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock   The script  by Christopher Cleveland  was to be based on Jeffrey Potter s 1985 oral biography  To a Violent Grave  a collection of reminiscences by Pollock s friends  Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner  and De Niro was to portray Pollock   A second was to be based on Love Affair  1974   a memoir by Ruth Kligman  who was Pollock s lover in the six months before his death  This was to be directed by Harold Becker  with Al Pacino playing Pollock   In 2000  the biographical film Pollock  based on the Pulitzer Prize winning biography  Jackson Pollock  An American Saga  directed by and starring Ed Harris was released  Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner  The movie was the project of Ed Harris  who portrayed Pollock  He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor  Harris himself painted the works seen in the film  The Pollock Krasner Foundation did not authorize or collaborate with any production   In September 2009  the art historian Henry Adams claimed in Smithsonian  magazine  that Pollock had written his name in his famous painting Mural  1943   The painting is now insured for $140 million  In 2011  the Republican Iowa State Representative Scott Raecker introduced a bill to force the sale of the artwork  held by The University of Iowa  in order to fund scholarships  but his bill created such controversy that it was quickly withdrawn   10  Critical debate  Pollock s work has been the subject of important critical debates  The critic Robert Coates once derided a number of Pollock’s works as “mere unorganized explosions of random energy  and therefore meaningless ”  In a famous 1952 article in ARTnews  Harold Rosenberg coined the term  action painting   and wrote that  what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event  The big moment came when it was decided to paint  just to paint   The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value舒political  aesthetic  moral   Many people assumed that he had modeled his  action painter  paradigm on Pollock   Clement Greenberg supported Pollock s work on formalistic grounds  It fit well with Greenberg s view of art history as a progressive purification in form and elimination of historical content  He considered Pollock s work to be the best painting of its day and the culmination of the Western tradition via Cubism and Cézanne to Manet   Reynold s News in a 1959 headline said   This is not art舒it s a joke in bad taste    The Congress for Cultural Freedom  an organization to promote American culture and values  backed by the CIA  sponsored exhibitions of Pollock s work  Certain left wing scholars  most prominently Eva Cockcroft  have argued that the U S  government and wealthy elite embraced Pollock and abstract expressionism in order to place the United States in the forefront of global art and devalue socialist realism  Cockcroft wrote that Pollock became a  weapon of the Cold War    11  List of major works   1942  Male and Female

Art market  In 1973  Blue Poles  Blue Poles  Number 11  1952   was purchased by the Australian Whitlam Government for the National Gallery of Australia for US $2 million  A$1 3 million at the time of payment   At the time  this was the highest price ever paid for a modern painting  The painting is now one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery  It was a centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art s 1998 retrospective in New York  the first time the painting had been shown in America since its purchase   In November 2006  Pollock s No  5  1948 became the world s most expensive painting  when it was sold privately to an undisclosed buyer for the sum of $140 000 000  Another artist record was established in 2004  when No  12  1949   a medium sized drip painting that had been shown in the United States Pavilion at the 1950 Venice Biennale  fetched $11 7 million at Christie s  New York  In 2012  Number 28  1951  one of the artist’s combinations of drip and brushwork in shades of silvery gray with red  yellow and shots of blue and white  also sold at Christie s  New York  for $20 5 million—$23 million with fees—within its estimated range of $20 million to $30 million   In 2013 Pollock s  Number 19   1948  was sold by Christies for a reported $58 363 750 during an auction that ultimately reached $495 million total sales in one night which Christies reports as a record to date as the most expensive auction of contemporary art   13  Influence  Pollock s staining into raw canvas was adapted by the Color Field painters Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis  Frank Stella made  all over composition  a hallmark of his works of the 1960s  The Happenings artist Allan Kaprow  sculptors Richard Serra  Eva Hesse and many contemporary artists have retained Pollock’s emphasis on the process of creation  they were influenced by his approach to process  rather than the look of his work  In 2004  One  Number 31 was ranked the 8th most influential piece of modern art in a poll of 500 artists  curators  critics  and dealers   14  Notes  15  References    www mcah columbia edu arthumanities mov arthum pollock studio mov  16  External links  at WikiArt  at the NGA  Smarthistory videos
