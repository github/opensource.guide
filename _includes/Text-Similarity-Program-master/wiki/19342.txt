The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants   1  Classification  The Magnoliales include six families   Annonaceae  custard apple family  over 2000 species of trees  shrubs  and lianas  mostly tropical but some temperate   Degeneriaceae  two species of trees found on Pacific islands   Eupomatiaceae  two species of trees and shrubs found in New Guinea and eastern Australia   Himantandraceae  two species of trees and shrubs  found in tropical areas in Southeast Asia and Australia   Magnoliaceae  about 225 species including magnolias and tulip trees   Myristicaceae  several hundred species including Nutmeg   1 1  APG system  The APG system  1998   APG II system  2003   and APG III system  2009  place this order in the clade magnoliids  circumscribed as follows   In these systems  published by the APG  the Magnoliales are a basal group  excluded from the eudicots   1 2  Earlier systems  The Cronquist system  1981  placed the order in the subclass Magnoliidae of class Magnoliopsida   dicotyledons  and used this circumscription   order Magnoliales  family Annonaceae  family Austrobaileyaceae  family Canellaceae  family Degeneriaceae  family Eupomatiaceae  family Himantandraceae  family Lactoridaceae  family Magnoliaceae  family Myristicaceae  family Winteraceae The Thorne system  1992  placed the order in superorder Magnolianae  subclass Magnoliidae    dicotyledons   in the class Magnoliopsida    angiosperms  and used this circumscription  including the plants placed in order Laurales and Piperales by other systems    order Magnoliales  family Amborellaceae  family Annonaceae  family Aristolochiaceae  family Austrobaileyaceae  family Calycanthaceae  family Canellaceae  family Chloranthaceae  family Degeneriaceae  family Eupomatiaceae  family Gomortegaceae  family Hernandiaceae  family Himantandraceae  family Illiciaceae  family Lactoridaceae  family Lauraceae  family Magnoliaceae  family Monimiaceae  family Myristicaceae  family Piperaceae  family Saururaceae  family Schisandraceae  family Trimeniaceae  family Winteraceae The Engler system  in its update of 1964  placed the order in subclassis Archychlamydeae in class Dicotyledoneae   dicotyledons  and used this circumscription   order Magnoliales  family Amborellaceae  family Annonaceae  family Austrobaileyaceae  family Calycanthaceae  family Canellaceae  family Cercidiphyllaceae  family Degeneriaceae  family Eupomatiaceae  family Eupteleaceae  family Gomortegaceae  family Hernandiaceae  family Himantandraceae  family Illiciaceae  family Lauraceae  family Magnoliaceae  family Monimiaceae  family Myristicaceae  family Schisandraceae  family Trimeniaceae  family Tetracentraceae  family Trochodendraceae  family Winteraceae The Wettstein system  latest version published in 1935  did not use this name although it had an order with a similar circumscription with the name Polycarpicae  This was placed in the Dialypetalae in subclass Choripetalae of class Dicotyledones   See also Sympetalae    From the above it will be clear that the plants included in this order by APG have always been seen as related  They have always been placed in the order Magnoliales  or a predecessor   The difference is that earlier systems have also included other plants  which have been moved to neighbouring orders  in the magnoliids  by APG   2  References
