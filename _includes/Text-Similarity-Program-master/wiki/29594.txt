Stephen I  also Saint Stephen        975 – 15 August 1038  was the last Grand Prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001  and the first King of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038  The year of his birth is uncertain  but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in Esztergom  At his birth  he was given the pagan name Vajk  The date of his baptism is unknown  He was the only son of Grand Prince Géza and his wife  Sarolt  who was descended from the prominent family of the gyulas  Although both of his parents were baptized  Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian  He married Gisela of Bavaria  a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty   After succeeding his father in 997  Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative  Koppány  who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors  He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights  including Vecelin  Hont and Pázmány  but also with help from native lords  He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II  In a series of wars against semi independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle  Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin  He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II  Holy Roman Emperor to withdraw from Hungary in 1030   Stephen established at least one archbishopric  six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries  thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire  He ensured the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs  His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials  Hungary  which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign  became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople   He survived all of his children  He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in his new basilica  built in Székesfehérvár and dedicated to the Holy Virgin  His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades  He was canonized  together with his son  Emeric  and Bishop Gerard of Csanád  in 1083  Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories  In Hungary  his feast day  celebrated on 20 August  is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state   1  Early years   975–997   The date of Stephen s birth is uncertain  because it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents  Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years  967  969 and 975  The unanimous testimony of his legends and other Hungarian sources  which state that Stephen was  still an adolescent  in 997  substantiate the reliability of the later year  975   Stephen s Lesser Legend adds that he was born in Esztergom  His place of birth also implies that he was born after 972  because his father  Géza  Grand Prince of the Hungarians  chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year  Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force  but never ceased worshipping pagan gods  Both his son s Greater Legend and the nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg described Géza as a cruel monarch  suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords   Hungarian chronicles unanimously report that Stephen s mother was Sarolt  a daughter of Gyula  a Hungarian chieftain with jurisdiction either in Transylvania or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros  Many historiansincluding Pál Engel and Gyula Kristópropose that her father was identical with  Gylas   who had around 952 been baptized in Constantinople and  remained faithful to Christianity   according to the Byzantine chronicler  John Skylitzes  However  this identification is not unanimously accepted  for instance  historian György Györffy says that it was not Sarolt s father  but his younger brother who was baptized in the Byzantine capital  In contrast with all Hungarian sources  the Polish Hungarian Chronicle and later Polish sources state that Stephen s mother was Adelhaid  an otherwise unknown sister of Duke Mieszko I of Poland  but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians  He was born as Vajk  which derived from a Turkic word baj  meaning  hero    master    prince   or  rich   Stephen s Greater Legend narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop Adalbert of Prague  who stayed in Géza s court several times between 983 and 994  However  St Adalbert s nearly contemporaneous Legend  written by Bruno of Querfurt  does not mention of the event  Accordingly  the date of Stephen s baptism is unknown  Györffy argues that Stephen was baptized soon after birth  while Kristó proposes that he only received baptism just before his father s death in 997  He was given his baptismal name in honour of the first martyr  Saint Stephen   Stephen s official biography  written by Bishop Hartvik and sanctioned by Pope Innocent III  narrates that he  was fully instructed in knowledge of the grammatical art  in his childhood  implying that he studied Latin  His two other late 11th century biographies do not mention Stephen s grammatical studies  They only state that he  was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince   Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen s physical training  including his participation in hunts and military actions  According to the Illuminated Chronicle  one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from Italy  who later founded a monastery in Tata   According to Stephen s legends  Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen  ascended to the first stage of adolescence   when he was 14 or 15  Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those who were present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince  Györffy also writes  without referring to his source  that Géza appointed his son to rule the  Nyitra ducate  around that time  Slovak historians  including Ján Steinhübel and Ján Lukačka  accept Györffy s view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra  now Nitra  Slovakia  from around 995   Upon his father s initiative  Stephen married Gisela  the daughter of Henry the Wrangler  Duke of Bavaria  r  955–995  in or after 995  This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house  because Gisela was closely related to the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Emperors  According to popular tradition preserved in the Scheyern Abbey in Bavaria  the ceremony took place at the castle of Scheyern and was celebrated by Bishop Adalbert of Prague  Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights  many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary  The arrival of these heavily armed warriors strengthened Stephen s military position  Györffy writes that Stephen and his wife  presumably  settled in Nyitra after their marriage   2  Reign  997–1038   2 1  Grand Prince  997–1000   Grand Prince Géza died in 997  Stephen convoked an assembly to Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince  Initially  he only controlled the northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin  the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains  Stephen s ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son  On the other hand  it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority  according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty  who was Koppány at that time  Koppány  who held the title Duke of Somogy  had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton   Koppány proposed to Géza s widow  Sarolt  in accordance with the pagan custom of levirate marriage  He also announced his claim to the throne  Although it is not impossible that Koppány had already in 972 been baptized  most of his supporters were pagans  opponents of Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue  A charter of 1002 for the Pannonhalma Archabbey even writes of a war between  the Germans and the Hungarians  when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Koppány  Even so  Györffy says that Oszlar   Alan    Besenyő   Pecheneg    Kér and other place names  referring to ethnic groups or Hungarian tribes in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Koppány s duchy  suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriorswho had been settled there by Grand Prince Gézafought in Stephen s army  Kristó states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Koppány was only a feud between two members of the Árpád dynasty  with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders  Koppány and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia  took many of Stephen s forts and plundered his lands  Stephen  who  was for the first time girded with his sword   according to the Illuminated Chronicle placed the brothers Hont and Pázmány at the head of his own guard and nominated Vecelin to lead the royal army  The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of Géza  Hont and Pázmány were  according to Simon of Kéza s Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle   knights of Swabian origin  who settled in Hungary either under Géza or in the first years of Stephen s reign  On the other hand  Lukačka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and Pázmány were  Slovak  noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra   Koppány was besieging Veszprém when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen s army  In the ensuing battle  Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies  Koppány was killed on the battlefield  His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom  Győr  Gyulafehérvár  Alba Iulia  Romania  and Veszprém in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch   Stephen occupied Koppány s duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans  He also prescribed that Koppány s former subjects were to pay tithes to this monastery  according to the deed of the foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey which has been preserved in a manuscript containing interpolations  The same document declares that  there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary  at that time  On the other hand  the nearly contemporary Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg stated that Stephen  established bishoprics in his kingdom  before being crowned king  If the latter report is valid  the dioceses of Veszprém and Győr are the most probable candidates   2 2  Coronation  1000–1001   When ordering the display of one part of Koppány s quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár  the seat of his maternal uncle  Gyula the Younger  Stephen demonstrated his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords  He also decided to confirm his international position by adopting the title of king  However  the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate   Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown  with the favour and urging  of Emperor Otto III  r  996–1002   implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor s suzerainty before his coronation  On the other hand  all of Stephen s legends emphasize that he received his crown from Pope Sylvester II  r  999–1003   Kristó and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies  which implies that both reports are valid  Stephen  received the crown and consecration  from the Pope  but not without the Emperor s consent  Around 75 years after the coronation  Pope Gregory VII  r  1075–1085   who claimed suzerainty over Hungary  declared that Stephen had  offered and devotedly surrendered  Hungary  to Saint Peter   that is to the Holy See   In a contrasting report  Stephen s Greater Legend states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary  Modern historiansincluding Pál Engel  and Miklós Molnárwrite that Stephen always demonstrated his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty  For instance  none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors  which would have been the case if he had been the German monarch s vassal  Furthermore  Stephen declared in the preamble to his First Book of Laws that he governed his realm  by the will of God    The exact date of Stephen s coronation is unknown  According to later Hungarian tradition  he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium  which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001  Details of Stephen s coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony  which took place in Esztergom  followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings  Accordingly  Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony  Stephen s portrait  preserved on his royal cloak from 1031  shows that his crown  similarly to the Holy Roman Emperor s diadem  was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones   Besides his crown  Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty  For instance  his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS   the king s spear   and depict an arm holding a spear with flag  According to the contemporaneous Adémar de Chabannes  a spear had been given to Stephen s father by Emperor Otto III in a token of Géza s right to  enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country   Stephen is styled in various waysUngarorum rex   king of the Hungarians    Pannoniorum rex   king of the Pannonians   or Hungarie rex   king of Hungary  in his charters   2 3  Consolidation  1001– 1009   Although Stephen s power did not rely on his coronation  the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm  by the Grace of God   All his legends testify that he established an archbishopric with its see in Esztergom shortly after his coronation  This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire  The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom  named Domokos  has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002  According to historian Gábor Thoroczkay  Stephen also established the Diocese of Kalocsa in 1001  Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom  Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague  including Radla and Astrik  arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign  The presence of an unnamed  Archbishop of the Hungarians  at the synod of 1007 of Frankfurt and the consecration of an altar in Bamberg in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen s prelates maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire   The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen s principal concerns throughout his reign  Although the Hungarians  conversion had already begun in his father s reign  it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals  His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity  For example  his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death  His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans  or regulated the status of serfs   Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen s suzerainty even after his coronation  The new King first turned against his own uncle  Gyula the Younger  whose realm  was most wide and rich   according to the Illuminated Chronicle  Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003  The contemporary Annals of Hildesheim adds that Stephen converted his uncle s  country to the Christian faith by force  after its conquest  Accordingly  historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period  If the identification  proposed by Kristó  Györffy and other Hungarian historians  of Gyula with one Prokuiwho was Stephen s uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburgis valid  Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boleslav the Brave  Duke of Poland  r  992–1025    About a hundred years later the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav the Brave  by stating that the latter  defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube   Györffy says that the chronicler s report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Moravaa tributary of the Danubeby the Poles in the 1010s  On the other hand  the Polish Hungarian Chronicle states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 1000s  According to Steinhübel  the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030  In contrast with the Slovak historian  Györffy writes that this late chronicle  in which one absurdity follows another  contradicts all facts known from 11th century sources  The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Stephen  led his army against Kean  Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified  following the occupation of Gyula s country  According to a number of historians  including Zoltán Lenkey and Gábor Thoroczkay  Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003  Other historians  including Györffy  say that the chronicle s report preserved the memory of Stephen s campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s   Likewise  the identification of the  Black Hungarians who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Adémar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen s proselytizing policyis uncertain  Györffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza  while Thoroczkay to the southern parts of Transdanubia  Bruno of Querfurt s report of the Black Hungarians  conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when  the first mission of Saint Peter a papal legate  Cardinal Azoarrived in Hungary  The latter attended the meeting in Győr where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of Pécs was issued on August 23  1009   The Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009  According to Thoroczkay   it is very probable  that the bishopric s establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabarsan ethnic group of Khazar origin and their chieftain  The head of the Kavarswho was either Samuel Aba or his father married Stephen s unnamed younger sister on this occasion  The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy  The reports by Anonymous  Simon of Kéza and other Hungarian chroniclers of the Bár Kalán  Csák and other 13th century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process   Stephen set up a territory based administrative system  establishing counties  Each county  headed by a royal official known as a count or ispán  were administrative units organized around royal fortresses  Most fortresses were earthworks in this period  but the castles at Esztergom  Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone  Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization  The settlements developing around them  where markets were held on each Sunday  were important local economic centers   2 4  Active foreign policy   1009–1031   Stephen s brother in law  Henry II  became King of Germany in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013  Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th century  Even when Henry II s discontented brother  Bruno  sought refugee in Hungary in 1004  Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers in law  Around 1009  he gave his younger sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo  Doge of Venice  r  1008–1026   a close ally of the Byzantine Emperor  Basil II  r  976–1025   which suggests that Hungary s relationship with the Byzantine Empire was also peaceful  On the other hand  the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018  The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava  Györffy and Kristó write that a Pecheneg incursion into Transylvania  the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen s legends  also took place in this period  because the Pechenegs were close allies of Boleslav the Brave s brother in law  Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev  r  1015–1019    Poland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Peace of Bautzen in January 1018  Later in the same years  500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied Boleslav the Brave to Kiev  suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty  The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav the Brave to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen  According to Leodvin  the first known Bishop of Bihar  r  1050 – 1060   Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against  barbarians  in the Balkan Peninsula  The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took  Cesaries   a town identified with Ohrid by Györffy and other historians  Leodvin s report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with the their conquest of Bulgaria in 1018  However  the exact date of his expedition is uncertain  Györffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians   Bishop Leodvin also wrote that Stephen collected relics of a number of saints in  Cesaries   including Saint George and Saint Nicholas of Myra  He donated them to his triple naved  new basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Székesfehérvár  He also set up a cathedral chapter here  Stephen transferred his capital from Esztergom to Székesfehérvár  His decision was influenced by the opening  in 1018 or 1019  of a new pilgrimage route  connecting Western Europe and the Holy Land through Hungary  which bypassed his old capital  Stephen often met the pilgrims  contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe  Abbot Odilo of Cluny  for example  wrote in a letter to Stephen that  those who have returned from the shrine of our Lord  testify to the king s passion  towards the honour of our divine religion   Stephen himself also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople  Jerusalem  Ravenna and Rome   In addition to pilgrims  merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe  Stephen s legends also wrote of 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary  but were attacked by Hungarian border guards  The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace  Regular minting of coinage also began in Hungary in the 1020s  Stephen s silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX   King Stephen   and REGIA CIVITAS   royal city   were popular in contemporary Europe  as demonstrated by their counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden  Stephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary  Gerard  a Benedictine monk  who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026 initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land  but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king  Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at Pécsvárad  Zalavár and Bakonybélin this period   Stephen s conflict with Ajtony  a chieftain in the region of the river Maroswhich is described in the Long Life of Saint Gerardis also dated by many historians to the very end of the 1020s  although Györffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier  The conflict arose when Ajtony  who  had taken his power from the Greeks   levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river  The king sent a large army led by Csanád against Ajtony  who was killed in battle  His lands were transformed into a Hungarian county and the king set up a new bishopric at Csanád  Cenad  Romania   Ajtony s former capital  which was renamed after the commander of the royal army  According to the Annales Posonienses  the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030   Stephen s brother in law  Emperor Henry  died on 13 July 1024  He was succeeded by a distant relative  Conrad II  r  1024–1039   who adopted an active foreign policy  Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolothe husband of Stephen s sisterfrom Venice in 1026  He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son  Henry  as their duke in 1027  although Stephen s son  Emeric had a strong claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother  Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors  Bishop Werner of Strasbourg  to Constantinople  The bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim  but Stephen  who had been informed on his actual purpose  refused to let him enter into his country in the autumn of 1027  Conrad II s biographer  Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029  causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries   Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River Rába  However  according to the Annals of Niederalteich  the emperor  suffering from consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarian army  returned to Germany  without an army and without achieving anything  because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at Vienna   Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungary in the summer of 1031   2 5  Last years  1031–1038   Stephen s biographer  Hartvic  narrates that the King  whose children died one by one in infancy   restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son   Emeric  However  Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031  After the death of his son  the elderly King could never  fully regain his former health   according to the Illuminated Chronicle  Kristó writes that the picture  which has been preserved in Stephen s legends  of the king keeping the vigils and washing the feet of paupers  is connected with Stephen s last years  following the death of his son   Emeric s death jeopardized his father s achievements in establishing a Christian state  because Stephen s cousin  Vazulwho had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism  According to the Annals of Altaich Stephen disregarded his cousin s claim and nominated his sister s son  the Venetian Peter Orseolo  as his heir  The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded  and his three sons  Levente  Andrew and Béla  were expelled from Hungary  Stephen s legends writes of an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king s life by members of his court  According to Kristó  the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act  That Vazul s ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources  including the Illuminated Chronicle   In the view of some historians  provisions in Stephen s Second Book of Laws on the  conspiracy against the king and the kingdom  imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul s unsuccessful plot against Stephen  However  this view has not been universally accepted  Györffy states that the law book was issued  not after 1031  but around 1009  Likewise  the authenticity of Stephen s decree on tithes is debated  according to Györffy  it is duly attributed to Stephen  but Berend  Laszlovszky and Szakács argue that it  might be a later addition    Stephen died on 15 August 1038  He was buried in the basilica of Székesfehérvár  A long period of instability followed his reign  which was characterized by civil wars  pagan uprisings and foreign invasions  The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus  a grandson of Vazul  ascended the throne   3  Family  Stephen married Gisela  a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria  who was a nephew of Otto I  Holy Roman Emperor  Gisela s mother was Gisela of Burgundy  a member of the Welf dynasty  Born around 985  Gisela was younger than her husband  whom she survived  She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060   Although the Illuminated Chronicle states that Stephen  begot many sons   only two of them  Otto and Emeric  are known by name  According to Kristó  Otto was born before 1002 and was named after Emperor Otto III  He died as a child   Emeric who received the name of his maternal uncle  Emperor Henry II  was born around 1007  His Legend from the early 1100s describes Emeric as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage  According to Györffy  Emeric s wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II  His premature death caused the series of conflicts leading to Vazul s blinding and civil wars   The following family tree presents Stephen s ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article   *A Khazar  Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady  **Samuel Aba might have been the son of Stephen s sister instead of her husband   4  Legacy  4 1  Founder of Hungary  Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary  His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state which ensured that the Hungarians have survived in the Carpathian Basin  in contrast with the Huns  Avars and other peoples who had before them controlled the same territory  Stephen  as Bryan Cartledge emphasizes  also gave his kingdom  forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule    His successors  even those who were descended from Vazul  were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen s achievements  Vazul s son  Andrew I of Hungary  r  1046–1060   although he acquired the throne due to a pagan uprising  prohibited pagan rites and declared that all of his subjects should  live in all things according to the law which King St  Stephen had taught them   In medieval Hungary  communities which claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own  liberties  often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen  In a letter of 1347  for example  in their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey to the king  the people of Táp stated that taxes levied upon them by the Abbot contradicted  the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen    4 2  The Holy King  Stephen s cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors  However  there is no evidence that he became an object of veneration before his canonization  For instance  the first member of his family to be named after him  Stephen II  was born in the early 12th century  Stephen s canonization was initiated by King Ladislaus I of Hungary  r  1077–1095  who was a grandson of Stephen s blinded cousin  Vazul  His canonization was  decreed by apostolic letter  by order of the Roman see   according to Bishop Hartvik  suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII   The ceremony started at Stephen s tomb  where masses of believers spent three days fasting and praying from 15 August 1083  Legend says that Stephen s coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held his dethroned cousin  Solomon  in captivity in a prison at Visegrád  Healing miracles followed the opening of Stephen s tomb  which are attributed by historian Kristó to mass psychosis and deception  According to Stephen s legends  his  balsam scented  remains were elevated from the coffin  which was filled with  rose colored water   on 20 August  On the same day  Stephen s son  Emeric  and the bishop of Csanád  Gerard  were also canonized   Stephen s first legend  the so called Greater Legend  was written between 1077 and 1083  It provided an idealized portrait of the king  who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary  However  Stephen s Lesser Legendwhich was composed around 1100  under King Coloman  r  1095–1116 emphasized Stephen s severity  Stephen s third legend was composed  also in King Coloman s reign  by Bishop Hartvik  who based his text on the previous two legends  Sanctioned in 1201 by Pope Innocent III  Hartvik s work served as Stephen s official legend  Gábor Klaniczay writes that Stephen s legends  suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers   opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre   Stephen was the first triumphant miles Christi   Christ s soldier   among the canonized monarchs  He was also a  confessor king  whose cult was sanctioned  in contrast with earlier holy monarchs  even though he had not suffered martyrdom   Stephen s cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary  Initially he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and Bamberg in Bavaria  but his relics were also taken to Aachen  Cologne  Montecassino and Namur  Upon the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Turks  Pope Innocent XI expanded Stephen s cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686  He declared 2 September as King Saint Stephen s feast day  As the feast of Saint Joachim was moved  in 1969  from 16 August  the day immediately following the day of Stephen s death  the latter s feast was moved to that date  Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary  He is regarded as the protector of kings  masons  stonecutters  stonemasons and bricklayers  and also of children suffering from dangerous illnesses  The canonization of Saint Stephen was recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in the year 2000  In the calendar of the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church  the feast is observed on 20 August  the day on which his relics were translated  In Hungary  a separate feast day  30 May  is dedicated to Stephen s  Holy Dexter    4 3  His Holy Dexter  Stephen s intact dexter  or right hand     became the subject of a cult  A cleric named Mercurius stole it  but it was discovered on 30 May 1184 in Bihar County  The theft of sacred relics  or furta sacra  had by that time become a popular topic of saints  biographies  Bishop Hartvik described the discovery of Stephen s right hand in accordance with this tradition  referring to adventures and visions  To the veneration of the Holy Dexter  an abbey was dedicated in Bihar County  The monastery was named Szentjobb  Sâniob  Romania  after the relic   The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242  when it was transferred to Ragusa  Dubrovnik  Croatia   The Holy Dexter was taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420  Following the occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Ottoman Turks in the middle of the 16th century  it was kept in many places  including Bosnia  Ragusa and Vienna  It was returned to Hungary in 1771 when Queen Maria Theresa  r  1740–1780  donated it to the cloister of the Sisters of Loreto in Buda  It was kept in the St  Sigismund Chapel in the Buda Castle between around 1900 and 1944  in a cave near Salzburg in Austria in 1944 and 1945  by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda between 1945 and 1950  and in the St  Stephen s Basilica in Budapest since 1950  An annual procession has celebrated the relic since 1938  except between 1950 and 1987 when its celebration was forbidden by the communist government   4 4  His Admonitions  According to Stephen s Greater Legend the King  himself compiled a book for his son on moral education   This work  now known as Admonitions or De institutione morum  was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages  Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the King or a cleric  most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century   The Admonitions argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith  Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates  but he is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong  One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the  pillars of his rule   meaning the prelates  the aristocrats  the ispáns and the warriors   4 5  Artistic representation  King Stephen has been a popular theme in art  especially since the 19th century  with the development of Romantic nationalism  Paintings  such as The Baptism of Vajk by Gyula Benczúr in 1875  and many statues representing the King throughout Hungary and the neighboring countries  testify to Stephen s importance in Hungarian national thought  Ferenc Erkel s last complete opera from 1885  István király   King Stephen    was named for him   Stephen I is also represented in a number of musical compositions  His best known representation in music was Beethoven s King Stephen Overture  In 1938  Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály wrote a choral piece titled Hymn to King Stephen     Levente Szörényi and János Bródy composed a rock opera  István  a király   Stephen  the King    of the early years of his reign in 1983  A sequel to it  Veled  Uram    You  Sir    was composed in 2000 by Szörényi   5  See also  Principality of Hungary  Kingdom of Hungary  1000–1526   History of Christianity in Hungary  6  References  7  Sources  7 1
