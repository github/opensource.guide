Kurt Hermann Eduard Karl Julius Schwitters  20 June 1887 – 8 January 1948  was a German artist who was born in Hanover  Germany   Schwitters worked in several genres and media  including Dada  Constructivism  Surrealism  poetry  sound  painting  sculpture  graphic design  typography  and what came to be known as installation art  He is most famous for his collages  called Merz Pictures   1  Early influences and the beginnings of Merz  1887 1922  1 1  Hanover  Kurt Schwitters was born on 20 June 1887  at No 2 Rumannstraße  Hanover  the only child of Edward Schwitters and his wife Henriette  née Beckemeyer   His parents were proprietors of a ladies  clothes shop  They sold the business in 1898  using the money to buy five properties in Hanover which they rented out  allowing the family to live off the income for the rest of Schwitters  life in Germany  In 1901 the family moved to Waldstraße  later Waldhausenstraße  5  future site of the Merzbau  The same year  Schwitters suffered his first epileptic seizure  a condition that would exempt him from military service in World War I until the last stages of the conflict  when conscription began to be applied to a far wider section of the population   After studying art at the Dresden Academy alongside Otto Dix and George Grosz   although Schwitters seems to have been unaware of their work  or indeed of contemporary Dresden artists Die Brücke   1909–15  Schwitters returned to Hanover and started his artistic career as a post impressionist  In 1911 he took part in his first exhibition  in Hanover  As the First World War progressed his work became darker  gradually developing a distinctive expressionist tone   Schwitters spent the last one and half years of the war working as a technical draftsman in a factory just outside Hanover  He was drafted into the 73rd Hanoverian Regiment in March 1917  but exempted as unfit in June of the same year  By his own account  his time as a draftsman influenced his later work  using machines as metaphors of human activity    In the war  at the machine factory at Wülfen  I discovered my love for the wheel and recognized that machines are abstractions of the human spirit   He married his cousin Helma Fischer on 5 October 1915  Their first son  Gerd  died within a week of birth  9 September 1916  their second  Ernst  was born on 16 November 1918  and was to remain close to his father for the rest of his life  up to and including a shared exile in Britain together   In 1918  his art was to change dramatically as a direct consequence of Germany s economic  political  and military collapse at the end of the First World War    In the war  things were in terrible turmoil  What I had learned at the academy was of no use to me and the useful new ideas were still unready     Everything had broken down and new things had to be made out of the fragments  and this is Merz  It was like a revolution within me  not as it was  but as it should have been    1 2  Der Sturm  Schwitters was to come into contact with Herwarth Walden after exhibiting expressionist paintings at the Hanover Secession in February 1918  He showed two Abstraktionen  semi abstract expressionist landscapes  at Walden s gallery Der Sturm  Berlin  June 1918  which led directly to meetings with members of the Berlin Avant garde  including Raoul Hausmann  Hannah Höch  and Hans Arp in the autumn of 1918     I remember  the night he introduced himself in the Café des Westens   I m a painter   he said   and I nail my pictures together   Raoul Hausmann Whilst Schwitters still created work in an expressionist style into 1919  and would continue to paint realist pictures up to his death in 1948   the first abstract collages  influenced in particular by recent works by Hans Arp  would appear in late 1918  which Schwitters dubbed Merz after a fragment of found text from the sentence Commerz Und Privatbank in his picture Das Merzbild  Winter 1918–19  By the end of 1919 he d become famous  after his first one man exhibition at Der Sturm gallery  June 1919  and the publication that August of the poem An Anna Blume  usually translated as  To Anna Flower   or  To Eve Blossom    a dadaist non sensical love poem  As Schwitters’s first overtures to Zurich and Berlin Dada made explicit mention of Merz pictures  there are no grounds for the widespread claim that he invented Merz because he was rejected by Berlin Dada   1 3  Dada and Merz  Schwitters asked to join Berlin Dada either in late 1918 or early 1919  according to the memoirs of Raoul Hausmann  Hausmann claimed that Richard Huelsenbeck rejected the application because of Schwitters  links to Der Sturm and to Expressionism in general  which were seen by the Dadaists as hopelessly romantic and obsessed with aesthetics  Ridiculed by Huelsenbeck as ‘the Caspar David Friedrich of the Dadaist Revolution’  he would reply with an absurdist short story Franz Mullers Drahtfrühling  Ersters Kapitel  Ursachen und Beginn der grossen glorreichen Revolution in Revon published in Der Sturm  xiii 11  1922   which featured an innocent bystander who started a revolution  merely by being there    Hausmann s anecdote about Schwitters asking to join Berlin Dada is  however  somewhat dubious  for there is well documented evidence that Schwitters and Huelsenbeck were on amicable terms at first  When they first met in 1919  Huelsenbeck was enthusiastic about Schwitters’s work and promised his assistance  while Schwitters reciprocated by finding an outlet for Huelsenbeck’s Dada publications  When Huelsenbeck visited him at the end of the year  Schwitters gave him a lithograph  which he kept all his life  and though their friendship was by now strained  Huelsenbeck wrote him a conciliatory note   You know I am well disposed towards you  I think too that certain disagreements we have both noticed in our respective opinions should not be an impediment to our attack on the common enemy  the bourgeoisie and philistinism   It was not until mid 1920 that the two men fell out  either because of the success of Schwitters s poem  An Anna Blume   which Huelsenbeck considered unDadaistic  or because of quarrels about Schwitters  contribution to Dadaco  a projected Dada atlas edited by Huelsenbeck  It is unlikely that Schwitters ever considered joining Berlin Dada  however  for he was under contract to Der Sturm  which offered far better long term opportunities than Dada’s quarrelsome and erratic venture  If Schwitters contacted Dadaists at this time  it was generally because he was searching for opportunities to exhibit his work   Though not a direct participant in Berlin Dada s activities  Schwitters employed Dadaist ideas in his work  used the word itself on the cover of An Anna Blume  and would later give Dada recitals throughout Europe on the subject with Theo van Doesburg  Tristan Tzara  Hans Arp and Raoul Hausmann  In many ways his work was more in tune with Zürich Dada s championing of performance and abstract art than Berlin Dada s agit prop approach  and indeed examples of his work were published in the last Zürich Dada publication  Der Zeltweg  November 1919  alongside the work of Arp and Sophie Tauber  Whilst his work was far less political than key figures in Berlin Dada  such as George Grosz and John Heartfield  he would remain close friends with various members  including Hannah Höch and Raoul Hausmann  for the rest of his career   In 1922 Theo van Doesburg organised a series of Dada performances in the Netherlands  Various members of Dada were invited to join  but declined  Eventually the programme comprised acts and performances by Theo van Doesburg  Nelly van Doesburg as Petrò Van Doesburg  Kurt Schwitters and sometimes Vilmos Huszàr  The Dada performances took place in various cities  amongst which Amsterdam  Leiden  Utrecht and The Hague  Schwitters also performed on solo evenings  one of which took place in April 1923 in Drachten  Friesland  Schwitters later on visited Drachten quite frequently  staying with a local painter  Thijs Rinsema  Schwitters created several collages there  probably together with Thijs Rinsema  Their collages can sometimes hardly be distinguished from each other   Merz has been called  Psychological Collage   Most of the works attempt to make coherent aesthetic sense of the world around Schwitters  using fragments of found objects  These fragments often make witty allusions to current events   Merzpicture 29a  Picture with Turning Wheel  1920 for instance  combines a series of wheels that only turn clockwise  alluding to the general drift Rightwards across Germany after the Spartacist Uprising in January that year  whilst Mai 191 9   alludes to the strikes organized by the Bavarian Workers  and Soldiers  Council   Autobiographical elements also abound  test prints of graphic designs  bus tickets  ephemera given by friends  Later collages would feature proto pop mass media images   En Morn  1947  for instance  has a print of a blonde young girl included  prefiguring the early work of Eduardo Paolozzi  whilst many works seem to have directly influenced Robert Rauschenberg  who said after seeing an exhibition of Schwitters  work at the Sidney Janis Gallery  1959  that  I felt like he made it all just for me     Whilst these works were usually collages incorporating found objects  such as bus tickets  old wire and fragments of newsprint  Merz also included artists  periodicals  sculptures  sound poems and what would later be called  installations   Schwitters was to use the term Merz for the rest of the decade  but  as Isabel Schulz has noted   though the fundamental compositional principles of Merz remained the basis and centre of  Schwitters’  creative work       the term Merz disappears almost entirely from the titles of his work after 1931’   2  Internationalism  1922–37  2 1  Merz  Periodical   As the political climate in Germany became more liberal and stable  Schwitters  work became less influenced by Cubism and Expressionism  He started to organise and participate in lecture tours with other members of the international avant garde  such as Hans Arp  Raoul Hausmann and Tristan Tzara  touring Czechoslovakia  Holland  and Germany with provocative evening recitals and lectures   Schwitters published a periodical  also called Merz  between 1923–32  in which each issue was devoted to a central theme  Merz 5 1923  for instance  was a portfolio of prints by Hans Arp  Merz 8 9  1924  was edited and typeset by El Lissitsky  Merz 14 15  1925  was a typographical children s story entitled The Scarecrow by Schwitters  Kätte Steinitz and Theo van Doesburg  The last edition  Merz 24  1932  was a complete transcription of the final draft of the Ursonate  with typography by Jan Tschichold   His work in this period became increasingly Modernist in spirit  with far less overtly political context and a cleaner style  in keeping with contemporary work by Hans Arp and Piet Mondrian  His friendship around this time with El Lissitzky proved particularly influential  and Merz pictures in this period show the direct influence of Constructivism   Thanks to Schwitters  lifelong patron and friend Katherine Dreier  his work was exhibited regularly in the US from 1920 onwards  In the late 1920s he became a well known typographer  his best known work was the catalogue for the Dammerstocksiedlung in Karlsruhe  After the demise of Der Sturm Gallery in 1924 he ran an advertising agency called Merzwerbe  which held the accounts for Pelikan inks and Bahlsen biscuits  amongst others  and became the official typographer for Hanover town council between 1929 and 1934  Many of these designs  as well as test prints and proof sheets  were to crop up in contemporary Merz pictures  In a manner similar to the typographic experimentation by Herbert Bayer at the Bauhaus  and Jan Tschichold s Die neue Typographie  Schwitters experimented with the creation of a new more phonetic alphabet in 1927  Some of his types were cast and used in his work  In the late 1920s Schwitters joined the Deutscher Werkbund  German Work Federation    2 2  The Merzbau  Alongside his collages  Schwitters also dramatically altered the interiors of a number of spaces throughout his life  The most famous was the Merzbau  the transformation of six  or possibly more  rooms of the family house in Hanover  Waldhausenstrasse 5  This took place very gradually  work started in about 1923  the first room was finished in 1933  and Schwitters subsequently extended the Merzbau to other areas of the house until he fled to Norway in early 1937  Most of the house was let to tenants  so that the final extent of the Merzbau was less than is normally assumed  On the evidence of Schwitters  correspondence  by 1937 it had spread to two rooms of his parents  apartment on the ground floor  the adjoining balcony  the space below the balcony  one or two rooms of the attic and possibly part of the cellar  In 1943 it was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid   Early photos show the Merzbau with a grotto like surface and various columns and sculptures  possibly referring to similar pieces by Dadaists  including the Great Plasto Dio Dada Drama by Johannes Baader  shown at the first International Dada Fair  Berlin  1920  Work by Hannah Höch  Raoul Hausmann and Sophie Tauber  amongst others  were incorporated into the fabric of the installation  By 1933  it had been transformed into a sculptural environment  and three photos from this year show a series of angled surfaces aggressively protruding into a room painted largely in white  with a series of tableaux spread across the surfaces  In his essay  Ich und meine Ziele  in Merz 21  Schwitters referred to the first column of his work as the Cathedral Of Erotic Misery  There is no evidence that he used this name after 1930  however  The first use of the word  Merzbau  occurs in 1933   Photos of the Merzbau were reproduced in the journal of the Paris based group abstraction création in 1933 4  and were exhibited in MoMA in New York in late 1936   The Sprengel Museum in Hanover has a reconstruction of the first room of the Merzbau   Schwitters later created a similar environment in the garden of his house in Lysaker  near Oslo  known as the Haus am Bakken  the house on the slope   This was almost complete when Schwitters left Norway for England in 1940  It burnt down in 1951 and no photos survive  The last Merzbau  in Elterwater  Cumbria  England  remained incomplete on Schwitters  death in January 1948  A further environment that also served as a living space can still be seen on the island of Hjertoya near Molde  Norway  It is sometimes described as a fourth Merzbau  although Schwitters himself only ever referred to three  The interior has now been removed and will eventually be exhibited in the Romsdal Museum in Molde  Norway   2 3  The Ursonate  Schwitters composed and performed an early example of sound poetry  Ursonate  1922–32  a translation of the title is Original Sonata or Primeval Sonata   The poem was influenced by Raoul Hausmann s poem  fmsbw  which Schwitters heard recited by Hausmann in Prague  1921  Schwitters first performed the piece on 14 February 1925 at the home of Irmgard Kiepenheuer in Potsdam  He subsequently performed it regularly  both developing and extending it  He published his notations for the recital in the last Merz periodical in 1932  although he would continue to develop the piece for at least the next ten years   3  Exile  1937 48  3 1  Norway  As the political situation in Germany under the Nazis continued to deteriorate throughout the 1930s  his work began to be included in the Entartete Kunst  Degenerate Art  touring exhibition organised by the Nazi party from 1933  He lost his contract with Hanover City Council in 1934 and examples of his work in German museums were confiscated and publicly ridiculed in 1935  By the time his close friends Christof and Luise Spengemann and their son Walter were arrested by the Gestapo in August 1936 the situation had clearly become perilous   On 2 January 1937 Schwitters  wanted for an  interview  with the Gestapo  fled to Norway to join his son Ernst  who had already left Germany on 26 December 1936  His wife Helma decided to remain in Hanover  to manage their four properties  In the same year  his Merz pictures were included in the Entartete Kunst exhibition titled in Munich  making his return impossible   Helma visited Schwitters in Norway for a few months each year up to the outbreak of World War II  The joint celebrations for his mother Henriette s 80th birthday and his son Ernst s engagement  held in Oslo on 2 June 1939  would be the last time the two met   Schwitters started a second Merzbau while in exile in Lysaker nearby Oslo  in 1937 but abandoned it in 1940 when the Nazis invaded  this Merzbau was subsequently destroyed in a fire in 1951  His hut on the Norwegian island of Hjertøya  near Molde  is also frequently regarded as a Merzbau  For decades this building was more or less left to rot  but measures have now been taken to preserve the interior   3 2  The Isle of Man  When Nazi Germany invaded Norway  after a short period of internment on the Lofoten Islands  Schwitters fled to Leith  Scotland with his son and daughter in law on the patrol vessel between 8 and 18 June 1940  By now officially an  enemy alien   he was moved between various internment camps in Scotland and England before arriving on 17 July 1940 in Hutchinson Camp in the Isle of Man   The camp was situated in a collection of terraced houses around Hutchinson Square in Douglas  The camp soon comprised some 1 205 internees by end of July 1940  almost all of whom were German or Austrian  The camp was soon known as  the artist’s camp   comprising as it did many artists  writers  university professors and other intellectuals  In this environment  Schwitters was popular as a character  a raconteur and as an artist   He was soon provided studio space and took on students  many of whom would later become significant artists in their own right  He produced over 200 works during his internment  including more portraits than at any other time in his career  many of which he charged for  He contributed at least two portraits to the second art exhibition within the camp in November 1940  and in December he contributed  in English  to the camp newsletter  The Camp   At least in the early days of the camp’s existence  there was a shortage of art supplies which meant that the internees had to be resourceful to obtain the materials they needed  they would mix brick dust with sardine oil for paint  dig up clay when out on walks for sculpture  and rip up the lino floors to make cuttings which they then pressed through the clothes mangle to make linocut prints  Schwitters’ Merz extension of this included making sculptures in porridge    The room stank  A musty  sour  indescribable stink which came from three Dada sculptures which he had created from porridge  no plaster of Paris being available  The porridge had developed mildew and the statues were covered with greenish hair and bluish excrements of an unknown type of bacteria  Fred Uhlman in his memoir Schwitters was well liked in the camp and was a welcome distraction from the internment they were suffering  Fellow internees would later recall fondly his curious habits of sleeping under his bed and barking like a dog  as well as his regular Dadaist readings and performances  However  the epileptic condition which had not surfaced since his childhood began to recur whilst in the camp  His son attributed this to Schwitters’ depression at internment which he kept hidden from others in the camp   For the outside world he always tried to put up a good show  but in the quietness of the room I shared with him        his painful disillusion was clearly revealed to me        Kurt Schwitters worked with more concentration than ever during internment to stave off bitterness and hopelessness  Schwitters applied as early as October 1940 for release  with the appeal written in English   As artist  I can not be interned for a long time without danger for my art    but he was refused even after his fellow internees began to be released    I am now the last artist here   all the others are free  But all things are equal  If I stay here  then I have plenty to occupy myself  If I am released  then I will enjoy freedom  If I manage to leave for the U S   then I will be over there  You carry your own joy with you wherever you go   Letter to Helma Schwitters  April 1941  Schwitters was finally released on 21 November 1941  with the help of an intervention from Alexander Dorner  Rhode Island School of Design   3 3  London  After obtaining his freedom Schwitters moved to London  hoping to make good on the contacts that he had built up over his period of internment  He first moved to an attic flat at 3 St  Stephen Crescent  Paddington  London  It was here that he met his future companion  Edith Thomas   “He knocked on her door to ask how the boiler worked  and that was that        She was 27 – half his age  He called her Wantee  because she was always offering tea ” Gretel Hinrichsen quoted in The Telegraph In London he made contact with and mixed with a range of artists  including Naum Gabo  László Moholy Nagy and Ben Nicholson  He exhibited in a number of galleries in the city but with little success  at his first solo exhibition at The Modern Art Gallery in December 1944  forty works were displayed  priced between 15 and 40 guineas  but only one was bought   During his years in London  the shift in Schwitters’ work continued towards an organic element that augmented the mass produced ephemera of previous years with natural forms and muted colours  Pictures such as Small Merzpicture With Many Parts 1945 6  for example  used objects found on a beach  including pebbles and smooth shards of porcelain   In August 1942 he moved with his son to 39 Westmoreland Road  Barnes  London  In October 1943 he learnt that his Merzbau in Hanover had been destroyed in allied bombing  In April 1944 he suffered his first stroke  at the age of 56  which left him temporarily paralyzed on one side of his body  His wife Helma died of cancer on 29 October 1944  although Schwitters only heard of her death in December   3 4  The Lake District  Schwitters first visited the Lake District on holiday with Edith Thomas in September 1942  He moved there permanently on 26 June 1945  to 2 Gale Crescent Ambleside  However  after another stroke in February of the following year and further illness  he and Edith moved to a more easily accessible house at 4 Millans Park   During his time in Ambleside Schwitters created a sequence of proto pop art pictures  such as For Käte  1947  after the encouragement from his friend  Käte Steinitz  Having emigrated to the United States in 1936  Steinitz sent Schwitters letters describing life in the emerging consumer society  and wrapped the letters in pages of comics to give a flavour of the new world  which she encouraged Schwitters to ‘Merz’   In March 1947  Schwitters decided to recreate the Merzbau and found a suitable location in a barn at Cylinders Farm  Elterwater  which was owned by Harry Pierce  whose portrait Schwitters had been commissioned to paint  Having been forced by a lack of other income to paint portraits and popularist landscape pictures suitable for sale to the local residents and tourists  Schwitters received notification shortly before his 60th birthday that he had been awarded a £1 000 fellowship to be transferred to him via the Museum of Modern Art in New York in order to enable him to repair or re create his previous Merz constructions in Germany or Norway  Instead he used it for the  Merzbarn  in Elterwater  Schwitters worked on the Merzbarn daily  travelling the five miles between his home and the barn  except for when illness kept him away  On 7 January 1948 he received the news that he had been granted British citizenship  The following day  on 8 January  Schwitters died from acute pulmonary edema and myocarditis  in Kendal Hospital   He was buried on 10 January at St  Mary s Church  Ambleside  His grave was unmarked until 1966 when a stone was erected with the inscription Kurt Schwitters – Creator of Merz  The stone remains as a memorial even though his body was disinterred and reburied in the Engesohde Cemetery in Hanover in 1970  the grave being marked with a marble copy of his 1929 sculpture Die Herbstzeitlose   4  Posthumous reputation  4 1  Merzbarn  One entire wall of the Merzbarn was removed to the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle for safe keeping  The shell of the barn remains in Elterwater  near Ambleside  In 2011 the Merzbarn was reconstructed in the front courtyard of the Royal Academy in London as part of its exhibition Modern British Sculpture   4 2  Influences  Many artists have cited Schwitters as a major influence  including Ed Ruscha  Robert Rauschenberg  Damien Hirst  Al Hansen  and Arman    The language of Merz now finds common acceptance and today there is scarcely an artist working with materials other than paint who does not refer to Schwitters in some way  In his bold and wide ranging experiments he can be seen as the grandfather of Pop Art  Happenings  Concept Art  Fluxus  multimedia art and post modernism   Gwendolyn Webster  5  Art market  Schwitters’ Ja Was  Bild  1920   an abstract work made of oil  paper  cardboard  fabric  wood and nails  was sold £13 9 million at Christie s London in 2014   5 1  Marlborough Gallery controversy  Schwitters  son  Ernst  largely entrusted the artistic estate of his father to Gilbert Lloyd  director of the Marlborough Gallery  However  Ernst fell victim to a crippling stroke in 1995  moving control of the estate as a whole to Kurt s grandson  Bengt Schwitters  Controversy erupted when Bengt  who has said he has  no interest in art and his grandfather s works   terminated the standing agreement between the family and the Marlborough Gallery  The Marlborough Gallery filed suit against the Schwitters estate in 1996  after confirming Ernst Schwitters  desire to have Mr  Lloyd continue to administer the estate in his will   Professor Henrick Hanstein  an auctioneer and art expert  provided key testimony in the case  stating that Schwitters was virtually forgotten after his death in exile in England in 1948  and that the Marlborough Gallery had been vital in ensuring the artist s place in art history  The verdict  which was eventually upheld by Norway s highest court  awarded the gallery USD 2 6 million in damages   5 2  Archival and forgeries  Schwitters  visual work has now been completely catalogued in the Catalogue Raisonné  Forgeries of collages by Schwitters turn up almost weekly on eBay  Before purchasing any work supposedly by Schwitters  it is best to consult the Kurt Schwitters Archive at the Sprengel Museum in Hanover  Germany   6  Legacy  Brian Eno sampled
