Skylab was a space station launched and operated by NASA and was the United States  first space station  Skylab orbited the Earth from 1973 to 1979  and included a workshop  a solar observatory  and other systems  It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket  with a weight of   Three manned missions to the station  conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the Apollo Command Service Module  CSM  atop the smaller Saturn IB  each delivered a three astronaut crew  On the last two manned missions  an additional Apollo   Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed   The station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield separated from the workshop and tore away  taking one of two main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other one so that it could not deploy  This deprived Skylab of most of its electrical power  and also removed protection from intense solar heating  threatening to make it unusable  The first crew was able to save it in the first in space major repair  by deploying a replacement heat shade and freeing the jammed solar panels   Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mount  which was a multi spectral solar observatory  Multiple Docking Adapter  with two docking ports   Airlock Module with EVA hatches  and the Orbital Workshop  the main habitable volume  Electrical power came from solar arrays  as well as fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM  The rear of the station included a large waste tank  propellant tanks for maneuvering jets  and a heat radiator   Numerous scientific experiments were conducted aboard Skylab during its operational life  and crews were able to confirm the existence of coronal holes in the Sun  The Earth Resources Experiment Package  EREP  was used to view the Earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible  infrared  and microwave spectral regions  Thousands of photographs of Earth were taken  and records for human time spent in orbit were extended  Plans were made to refurbish and reuse Skylab  using the Space Shuttle to boost its orbit and repair it  However  development of the Shuttle was delayed  and Skylab reentered Earth s atmosphere and disintegrated in 1979  with debris striking portions of Western Australia  Post Skylab NASA space laboratory projects included Spacelab  Shuttle Mir  and Space Station Freedom  later merged into the International Space Station    1  Background  Rocket scientist and space architect Wernher von Braun  writer Arthur C  Clarke  and other early advocates expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration  Von Braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles in Collier s   Man Will Conquer Space Soon    from 1952 to 1954 on manned space travel  He envisioned a large  circular station 250 feet  75m  in diameter that would rotate to generate artificial gravity and require a fleet of 7 000 ton  6500 metric tonnes  space shuttles for construction  The 80 men aboard the station would include astronomers operating a telescope  meteorologists to forecast the weather  and soldiers to conduct surveillance  Von Braun expected that future expeditions to the moon and Mars would leave from the station   The development of the transistor  the solar cell  and telemetry led in the 1950s and early 1960s to unmanned satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to earth  A large station was no longer necessary for such purposes  and the United States program to send men to the moon  Project Apollo  was designed to not require in orbit assembly  A smaller station that a single rocket could launch retained value  however  for scientific purposes   1 1  Early studies  In 1959  von Braun  head of the Development Operations Division at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency  submitted his final Project Horizon plans to the U S  Army  The overall goal of Horizon was to place a human on the Moon  a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming NASA  Although concentrating on the Moon missions  von Braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a Horizon upper stage  an idea used for Skylab  A number of NASA centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s  Studies generally looked at platforms launched by the Saturn V  followed up by crews launched on Saturn IB using an Apollo Command Service Module  or a Gemini capsule on a Titan II C  the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed  Proposals ranged from an Apollo based station with two to three men  or a small  canister  for four men with Gemini capsules resupplying it  to a large  rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years  A proposal to study the use of a Saturn S IVB as a manned space laboratory was documented in 1962 by the Douglas Aircraft Company   1 2  Air Force plans  The Department of Defense  DoD  and NASA cooperated closely in many areas of space  In September 1963  NASA and the DoD agreed to cooperate in building a space station  The DoD wanted its own manned facility  however  and in December it announced Manned Orbital Laboratory  MOL   a small space station primarily intended for photo reconnaissance using large telescopes directed by a two man crew  The station was the same diameter as a Titan II upper stage  and would be launched with the crew riding atop in a modified Gemini capsule with a hatch cut into the heat shield on the bottom of the capsule  MOL competed for funding with a NASA station for the next five years and politicians and other officials often suggested that NASA participate in MOL or use the DoD design  The military project led to changes to the NASA plans so that they would resemble MOL less   2  Development  2 1  Apollo Applications Program  NASA management was concerned about losing the 400 000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the moon in 1969  A reason Von Braun  head of NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1960s  advocated for a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets  which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo  NASA set up the Apollo Logistic Support System Office  originally intended to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions  The office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study  including an extended stay lunar mission which required two Saturn V launchers  a  lunar truck  based on the Lunar Module  LEM   a large manned solar telescope using a LEM as its crew quarters  and small space stations using a variety of LEM or CSM based hardware  Although it did not look at the space station specifically  over the next two years the office would become increasingly dedicated to this role  In August 1965  the office was renamed  becoming the Apollo Applications Program  AAP    As part of their general work  in August 1964 the Manned Spacecraft Center  MSC  presented studies on an expendable lab known as Apollo  X   short for Apollo Extension System   Apollo X  would have replaced the LEM carried on the top of the S IVB stage with a small space station slightly larger than the CSM s service area  containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days  duration  Using this study as a baseline  a number of different mission profiles were looked at over the next six months   2 2  Wet workshop  In November 1964  von Braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from the S II second stage of a Saturn V  His design replaced the S IVB third stage with an aeroshell  primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top  Inside the shell was a cylindrical equipment section  On reaching orbit  the S II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel  then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch  This became known as a  wet workshop  concept  because of the conversion of an active fuel tank  The station filled the entire interior of the S II stage s hydrogen tank  with the equipment section forming a  spine  and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster  This would have resulted in a very large living area  Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S II stage   One problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated Saturn V launch to fly the station  At the time the design was being proposed  it was not known how many of the then contracted Saturn Vs would be required to achieve a successful Moon landing  However  several planned Earth orbit test missions for the LEM and CSM had been canceled  leaving a number of Saturn IBs free for use  Further work led to the idea of building a smaller  wet workshop  based on the S IVB  launched as the second stage of a Saturn IB   A number of S IVB based stations were studied at MSC from mid 1965  which had much in common with the Skylab design that eventually flew  An airlock would be attached to the hydrogen tank  in the area designed to hold the LEM  and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank itself in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume  Floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it  After launch  a follow up mission launched by a Saturn IB would launch additional equipment  including solar panels  an equipment section and docking adapter  and various experiments  Douglas Aircraft  builder of the S IVB stage  was asked to prepare proposals along these lines  The company had for several years been proposing stations based on the S IV stage  before it was replaced by the S IVB   On April 1  1966  MSC sent out contracts to Douglas  Grumman  and McDonnell for the conversion of a S IVB spent stage  under the name Saturn S IVB spent stage experiment support module  SSESM   In May  astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage s hydrogen tank in space  Nevertheless  in late July it was announced that the Orbital Workshop would be launched as a part of Apollo mission AS 209  originally one of the Earth orbit CSM test launches  followed by two Saturn I CSM crew launches  AAP 1 and AAP 2   MOL remained AAP s chief competitor for funds  although the two programs cooperated on technology  NASA considered flying experiments on MOL  or using its Titan IIIC booster instead of the much more expensive Saturn IB  The agency decided that the Air Force station was not large enough  and that converting Apollo hardware for use with Titan would be too slow and too expensive  The DoD later canceled MOL in June 1969   2 3  Dry workshop  Design work continued over the next two years  in an era of shrinking budgets   NASA sought $450 million for Apollo Applications in fiscal year 1967  for example  but received $42 million   In August 1967  the agency announced that the lunar mapping and base construction missions examined by the AAP were being canceled  Only the Earth orbiting missions remained  namely the Orbital Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount solar observatory   The success of Apollo 8 in December 1968  launched on the third flight of a Saturn V  made it likely that one would be available to launch a dry workshop  Later  several Moon missions were canceled as well  originally to be Apollo missions 18 through 20  The cancellation of these missions freed up three Saturn V boosters for the AAP program  Although this would have allowed them to develop von Braun s original S II based mission  by this time so much work had been done on the S IV based design that work continued on this baseline  With the extra power available  the wet workshop was no longer needed  the S IC and S II lower stages could launch a  dry workshop   with its interior already prepared  directly into orbit   2 4  Habitability  A dry workshop simplified plans for the interior of the station  Industrial design firm Raymond Loewy William Snaith recommended emphasizing habitability and comfort for the astronauts by  for example  providing a wardroom for meals and relaxation  and a window to view the Earth and space  although astronauts who participated in Skylab planning were dubious about the designers  focus on areas such as color schemes  Habitability had not previously been an area of concern when building spacecraft  due to their small volume and brief mission durations  but the Skylab missions would last for months  NASA sent a scientist on Jacques Piccard s Ben Franklin submarine in the Gulf Stream in July and August 1969  to learn how six people would live in an enclosed space for four weeks   Astronauts were uninterested in watching movies on a proposed entertainment center or playing games  but did want books and individual music choices  Food was also important  early Apollo crews complained about its quality  and a NASA volunteer found living on the Apollo food for four days on Earth to be intolerable  its taste and composition  in the form of cubes and squeeze tubes  were unpleasant  Skylab food significantly improved on its predecessors by prioritizing edibility over scientific needs   Each astronaut had a private sleeping area the size of a small walk in closet  with a curtain  sleeping bag  and locker  Designers also added a shower and a toilet  the latter was both for comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on Earth   2 5  Rescue  Rescuing astronauts from Skylab was possible in the most likely emergency circumstances  The crew could use the CSM to quickly return to Earth if the station suffered serious damage  If the CSM failed  the spacecraft and Saturn IB for the next Skylab mission would have been launched with two astronauts to retrieve the crew  given Skylab s ample supplies  its residents would have been able to wait up to several weeks for the rescue mission   3  Operational history  3 1  Completion and launch  On August 8  1969  the McDonnell Douglas Corporation received a contract for the conversion of two existing S IVB stages to the Orbital Workshop configuration  One of the S IV test stages was shipped to McDonnell Douglas for the construction of a mock up in January 1970  The Orbital Workshop was renamed  Skylab  in February 1970 as a result of a NASA contest  The actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the AS 212 rocket  the S IVB stage   S IVB 212   The mission computer used aboard Skylab was the IBM System 4Pi TC 1  a relative of the AP 101 Space Shuttle computers  A Saturn V originally been produced for the Apollo program before the cancellation of Apollo 18  19  and 20  was repurposed and redesigned to launch Skylab  The Saturn V s upper stage removed  but with the avionics remaining in the same position   Skylab was launched on May 14  1973 by the modified Saturn V  The launch is sometimes referred to as Skylab 1  or SL 1  Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment  including the loss of the station s micrometeoroid shield sun shade and one of its main solar panels  Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield further complicated matters by pinning the remaining solar panel to the side of the station  preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit   Immediately following Skylab s launch  Pad A at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 was deactivated  and construction proceeded to modify it for the Space Shuttle program  originally targeting a maiden launch in March 1979  The manned missions to Skylab would occur from Launch Pad 39B   3 2  Manned missions  Three manned missions  designated SL 2  SL 3 and SL 4  were made to Skylab  The first manned mission  SL 2  launched on May 25  1973 atop a Saturn IB and involved extensive repairs to the station  The crew deployed a parasol like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases  This solution was designed by NASA s  Mr  Fix It  Jack Kinzler  who won the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts  The crew conducted further repairs via two spacewalks  extra vehicular activity  or EVA   The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days  Two additional missions followed  with the launch dates of July 28  1973  SL 3  and November 16  1973  SL 4   and mission durations of 59 and 84 days  respectively  The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on February 8  1974   3 3  Orbital operations  Skylab orbited Earth 2 476 times during the 171 days and 13 hours of its occupation during the three manned Skylab missions  Astronauts performed ten spacewalks  totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes  Skylab logged about 2 000 hours of scientific and medical experiments  127 000 frames of film of the Sun and 46 000 of the Earth  Solar experiments included photographs of eight solar flares  and produced valuable results that scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with unmanned spacecraft  The existence of the Sun s coronal holes were confirmed because of these efforts  Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts  adaptation to extended periods of microgravity   A typical day began at 6 AM Central Time Zone  Although the toilet was small and noisy  both veteran astronauts舒who had endured earlier missions  rudimentary waste collection systems舒and rookies complimented it  The first crew enjoyed taking a shower once a week  but found drying themselves in weightlessness and vacuuming excess water difficult  later crews usually cleaned themselves daily with wet washcloths instead of using the shower  Astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their stomach muscles   Breakfast began at 7 AM  Astronauts usually stood to eat  as sitting in microgravity also strained their stomach muscles  They reported that their food舒although greatly improved from Apollo舒was bland and repetitive  and weightlessness caused utensils  food containers  and bits of food to float away  also  gas in their drinking water contributed to flatulence  After breakfast and preparation for lunch  experiments  tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and  if possible  90 minutes of physical exercise followed  the station had a bicycle and other equipment  and astronauts could jog around the water tank  After dinner  which was scheduled for 6 PM  crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day s experiments  Following lengthy daily instructions  some of which were up to 15 meters long  sent via teleprinter  the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep   Each Skylab mission set a record for the amount of time astronauts spent in space  The station offered what a later study called  a highly satisfactory living and working environment for crews   with enough room for personal privacy  Although it had a dart set  playing cards  and other recreational equipment in addition to books and music players  the window with its view of Earth became the most popular way to relax in orbit   4  Experiments  Overview of most major experiments  Skylab 3 carried several more experiments  such as to observe Comet Kohoutek   5  Post SL 4 plans  Skylab was abandoned after the end of the SL 4 mission in February 1974  but to welcome visitors the crew left a bag filled with supplies and left the hatch unlocked  NASA discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station s age  but in 1977 and 1978  when the agency still believed the Space Shuttle would be ready by 1979  it completed two studies on reusing the station  By September 1978  the agency believed Skylab was safe for crews  with all major systems intact and operational  It still had 180 man days of water and 420 man days of oxygen  and astronauts could refill both  the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 man days of drinkable water and 420 man days of food   The studies cited several benefits from reusing Skylab  which one called a resource worth  hundreds of millions of dollars  with  unique habitability provisions for long duration space flight   Since no more operational Saturn V rockets were available after the Apollo program  four to five shuttle flights and extensive space architecture would have been needed to build another station as large as Skylab s volume  Its ample size舒much greater than that of the shuttle alone  or even the shuttle plus Spacelab舒was enough  with some modifications  for up to seven astronauts of both sexes  and experiments needing a long duration in space  even a movie projector for recreation was possible   Proponents of Skylab s reuse also said repairing and upgrading Skylab would provide information on the results of long duration exposure to space for future stations  The most serious issue for reactivation was stationkeeping  as one of the station s gyroscopes had failed and the attitude control system needed refueling  these issues would need EVA to fix or replace  The station had not been designed for extensive resupply  However  while plans had originally called for Skylab crews to perform only limited maintenance they successfully made major repairs during EVA  such as the SL 2 crew s deploying of the solar panel and the SL 4 crew s repair of the primary coolant loop  The SL 2 crew fixed one item during EVA by  reportedly   hit ting  it with  a  hammer    Some studies also said  beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience  reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses  and reduce the need to modify the shuttle for long duration missions  Even if the station were not manned again  went one argument  it would serve as a useful experimental platform   5 1  Shuttle mission plans  The reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases   An early Space Shuttle flight would have boosted Skylab to a higher orbit  adding five years of operational life  The shuttle might have pushed or towed the station  but attaching a booster舒the Teleoperator Retrieval System  TRS 舒to the station would have been more likely  based on astronauts  training for the task  Martin Marietta won the contract for $26 million to design the apparatus  TRS would contain about three tons of propellant  The remote controlled booster had TV cameras and was designed for duties such as space construction and servicing and retrieving satellites the shuttle could not reach  After rescuing Skylab  the TRS would have remained in orbit for future use  Alternatively  it could have been used to de orbit Skylab for a safe  controlled re entry and destruction   In two shuttle flights  Skylab would have been refurbished  In January 1982  the first mission would have attached a docking adapter and conducted repairs  In August 1983  a second crew would have replaced several system components   In March 1984  shuttle crews would have attached a solar powered Power Expansion Package  refurbished scientific equipment  and conducted 30  to 90 day missions using the Apollo Telescope Mount and the earth resources experiments   Over five years  Skylab would have been expanded to accommodate six to eight astronauts  with a new large docking interface module  additional logistics modules  Spacelab modules and pallets  and an orbital vehicle space dock using the shuttle s external tank  The first three phases would have required about $60 million in 1980s dollars  not including launch costs   6  After departure  After a boost of by SL 4 s Apollo CSM before its departure in 1974  Skylab was left in a parking orbit of by that was expected to last until at least the early 1980s  based on estimates of the 11 year sunspot cycle that began in 1976  NASA began considering the potential risks of a space station reentry as early as 1962  but decided to not incorporate a retrorocket system in Skylab due to cost and acceptable risk   The spent 49 ton Saturn V S II stage which had launched Skylab in 1973 remained in orbit for almost two years  and made an uncontrolled reentry on January 11  1975  Some debris  most prominently the five heavy J 2 engines  likely survived to impact in the North Atlantic Ocean  Although this event did not receive heavy media or public attention  it was followed closely by NASA and the Air Force  and helped emphasize the need for improved planning and public awareness for Skylab s eventual reentry   6 1  Solar activity  Greater than expected solar activity heated the outer layers of the Earth s atmosphere and thereby increased drag on Skylab  By late 1977  NORAD accurately forecast a reentry in mid 1979  a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most intense sunspot cycle in a century  and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976   The reentry of the USSR s nuclear powered Cosmos 954 in January 1978  and the resulting radioactive debris fall in northern Canada  drew more attention to Skylab s orbit  Although Skylab did not contain radioactive materials  the State Department warned NASA about the potential diplomatic repercussions of station debris  Battelle Memorial Institute forecast that up to 25 tons of metal debris could land in 500 pieces over an area 4 000 miles long and 1 000 miles wide  The lead lined film vault  for example  might land intact at 400 feet per second  Ground controllers re established contact with Skylab in March 1978 and recharged its batteries  Although NASA worked on plans to reboost Skylab with the Space Shuttle through 1978 and the TRS was almost complete  the agency gave up in December when it became clear that the shuttle would not be ready in time  its first flight  STS 1  did not occur until April 1981  Also rejected were proposals to launch the TRS using one or two unmanned rockets or to attempt to destroy the station with missiles   6 2  Re entry  Skylab s demise was an international media event  with merchandising of T shirts and hats with bullseyes  wagering on the time and place of re entry  and nightly news reports  The San Francisco Examiner offered a $10 000 prize for the first piece of Skylab delivered to its offices  the competing Chronicle offered $200 000 if a subscriber suffered personal or property damage  NASA calculated that the odds of station re entry debris hitting a human were 1 to 152 and the odds of any particular person being hit were 1 in 600 billion  although the odds of debris hitting a city of 100 000 or more were 1 to 7 and special teams were readied to head to any country hit by debris and requesting help   In the hours before re entry  ground controllers adjusted Skylab s orientation to try to minimize the risk of re entry on a populated area  They aimed the station at a spot south southeast of Cape Town  South Africa  and re entry began at approximately 16 37 UTC  July 11  1979  The Air Force provided data from a secret tracking system able to monitor the reentry  The station did not burn up as fast as NASA expected  however  Due to a 4% calculation error  debris landed southeast of Perth  Western Australia  and was found between Esperance and Rawlinna  from 31° to 34°S and 122° to 126°E  about 130–150 km radius around Balladonia  Residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful fireworks like flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere  The Shire of Esperance facetiously fined NASA A$400 for littering  a fine which remained unpaid for 30 years  The fine was paid in April 2009  when radio show host Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners and paid the fine on behalf of NASA   Seventeen year old Stan Thornton found 24 pieces of Skylab at his home in Esperance  A Philadelphia businessman flew him  his parents  and girlfriend to San Francisco  where he collected the Examiner prize  In a coincidence for the organizers  the annual Miss Universe pageant was scheduled to be held a few days later  on July 20  1979 in Perth  A large piece of Skylab debris was displayed on the stage  Analysis of the debris showed that the station had not disintegrated until 10 miles above the Earth  much lower than expected   After the demise of Skylab  NASA focused on the reusable Spacelab module  an orbital workshop that could be deployed with the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth  The next American major space station project was Space Station Freedom  which was merged into the International Space Station in 1993  and launched starting in 1998  Shuttle Mir was another project  and led to the U S  funding Spektr  Priroda  and the Mir Docking Module in the 1990s   7  Planned  but unflown missions  7 1  Skylab 5  Skylab 5 would have been a short 20 day mission to conduct scientific experiments and boost Skylab into a higher orbit  Vance Brand  commander   William B  Lenoir  science pilot   and Don Lind  pilot  would have been the crew for this mission  with Brand and Lind being the prime crew for the Skylab Rescue flights  Brand and Lind also trained for a mission that would have aimed Skylab for a controlled deorbit   7 2  Skylab B  In addition to the flown Skylab space station  a second flight quality backup Skylab space station had been built during the program  NASA considered using it for a second station in May 1973 or later  to be called Skylab B  S IVB 515   but decided against it  Launching another Skylab with another Saturn V rocket would have been very costly  and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the Space Shuttle instead  The backup is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington  D C   8  Engineering mock ups  A full size training mock up once used for astronaut training is located at the Lyndon B  Johnson Space Center visitor s center in Houston  Texas  Another full size training mock up is at the U S  Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville  Alabama  Originally displayed indoors  it was subsequently stored outdoors for several years to make room for other exhibits  To mark the 40th anniversary of the Skylab program  the Orbital Workshop portion of the trainer was restored and moved into the Davidson Center in 2013  NASA transferred the backup Skylab to the National Air and Space Museum in 1975  On display in the Museum s Space Hall since 1976  the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters   9  Mission designations  The numerical identification of the manned Skylab missions was the cause of some confusion  Originally  the unmanned launch of Skylab and the three manned missions to the station were numbered SL 1 through SL 4  During the preparations for the manned missions  some documentation was created with a different scheme    SLM 1 through SLM 3—for those missions only  William Pogue credits Pete Conrad with asking the Skylab program director which scheme should be used for the mission patches  and the astronauts were told to use 1 2 3  not 2 3 4  By the time NASA administrators tried to reverse this decision  it was too late  as all the in flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1 2 3 mission patches   10  Program cost  The Skylab program cost $2 2 billion from 1966 to 1974  or $10 billion in 2010 inflation adjusted dollars  As its three three man crews spent 510 total man days in space  each man day cost $19 6 million in 2010 dollars  compared to $7 5 million for the International Space Station   11  Gallery  File Skylab Latrine jpg The waste management
