Vittorio De Sica  7 July 1901 舑 13 November 1974  was an Italian director and actor  a leading figure in the neorealist movement   Four of the films he directed won Academy Awards  Sciuscià and Bicycle Thieves were awarded honorary Oscars  while Ieri  oggi  domani and Il giardino dei Finzi Contini won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar  Indeed  the great critical success of Sciuscià  the first foreign film to be so recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  and Bicycle Thieves helped establish the permanent Best Foreign Film Oscar  These two films generally are considered part of the canon of classic cinema  Bicycle Thieves was cited by Turner Classic Movies as one of the 15 most influential films in cinema history   De Sica was also nominated for the 1957 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for playing Major Rinaldi in American director Charles Vidor s 1957 adaptation of Ernest Hemingway s A Farewell to Arms  a movie that was panned by critics and proved a box office flop  De Sica s acting was considered the highlight of the film   1  Life and career  Born into poverty in Sora  Lazio  1901   he began his career as a theatre actor in the early 1920s and joined Tatiana Pavlova s theatre company in 1923  In 1933 he founded his own company with his wife Giuditta Rissone and Sergio Tofano  The company performed mostly light comedies  but they also staged plays by Beaumarchais and worked with famous directors like Luchino Visconti   His meeting with Cesare Zavattini was a very important event  together they created some of the most celebrated films of the neorealistic age  like Sciuscià  Shoeshine  and Bicycle Thieves  released as The Bicycle Thief in America   both of which De Sica directed   De Sica appeared in the British television series The Four Just Men  1959    2  Private life  His passion for gambling was well known  Because of it  he often lost large sums of money and accepted work that might not otherwise have interested him  He never kept his gambling a secret from anyone  in fact  he projected it on characters in his own movies  like Count Max  which he acted in but did not direct  and The Gold of Naples   In 1937 he married Giuditta Rissone  whom he met ten years before and who gave birth to their daughter  Emi  In 1942  on the set of Un garibaldino al convento  he met Spanish actress Maria Mercader  sister of Ramon Mercader  Trotsky s assassin   with whom he started a relationship   He was a Roman Catholic   After divorcing Rissone in France in 1954  he married Mercader in 1959  again in Mexico  but this union was not considered valid under Italian law  In 1968 he obtained French citizenship and married Mercader in Paris  Meanwhile he had already had two sons with her  Manuel  in 1949  a musician  and Christian  in 1951  who would follow his father s path as an actor and director   Although divorced  De Sica never parted from his first family  He led a double family life  with double celebrations on holidays  It is said that  at Christmas and on New Year s Eve  he used to put back the clocks by two hours in Mercader s house so that he could make a toast at midnight with both families  His first wife agreed to keep up the facade of a marriage so as not to leave her daughter without a father   Vittorio De Sica died at 73 after a surgery at the Neuilly sur Seine hospital in Paris   3

others aren t  The past teaches us that some films were received badly  while others go sailing on  There are two films doing very well right now in the Italian market  One is Il gattopardo  which earns seven million lire a day  and the other is Il diavolo  starring Sordi  which earns 3 1 2 million  So there are films that are doing very well  What I notice is that producers have been known to make errors in judgment  which have caused them to be overly daring  For example  I ve been told many millions were spent  somewhere around half a billion  for a film entrusted to a young person  We must make room for young people  but with half a billion we could have made eight of Bicycle Thieves  Experimental cinema should be inexpensive cinema  Half a billion lire should be entrusted to those professionals who we can be sure will bring home the half billion spent  We should be cautious with new initiatives  Producers should be cautious  As for television as a competitor  yes  there I see a danger  Let television do television  let them do documentaries  but cinema as such should be shown on screens  because there s no one more lazy than the public  When people don t have to leave their homes  they re very happy  A film shown in the home encourages the audience not to budge    8  References  9  External links  Sony Pictures Entertainment website  retrieved 8 April 2006  Wall Street
