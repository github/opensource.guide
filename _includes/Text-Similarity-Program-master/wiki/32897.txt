William Shakespeare    26 April 1564  baptised  – 23 April 1616  was an English  poet   playwright  and actor  widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world s pre eminent dramatist  He is often called England s national poet and the  Bard of Avon   His extant works  including some collaborations  consist of about 38 plays  154 sonnets  two long narrative poems  and a few other verses  the authorship of some of which is uncertain  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford upon Avon  At the age of 18  he married Anne Hathaway  with whom he had three children  Susanna  and twins Hamnet and Judith  Between 1585 and 1592  he began a successful career in London as an actor  writer  and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain s Men  later known as the King s Men  He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49  where he died three years later  Few records of Shakespeare s private life survive  and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance  sexuality  religious beliefs  and whether the works attributed to him were written by others   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613  His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres  He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608  including Hamlet  King Lear  Othello  and Macbeth  considered some of the finest works in the English language  In his last phase  he wrote tragicomedies  also known as romances  and collaborated with other playwrights   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime  In 1623  John Heminges and Henry Condell  two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare  published the First Folio  a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare s  It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson  in which Shakespeare is hailed  presciently  as  not of an age  but for all time   In the 20th and 21st century  his work has been repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance  His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied  performed  and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world   1  Life  1 1  Early life  William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare  an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield  and Mary Arden  the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer  He was born in Stratford upon Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564  His actual date of birth remains unknown  but is traditionally observed on 23 April  Saint George s Day  This date  which can be traced back to an 18th century scholar s mistake  has proved appealing to biographers  since Shakespeare died 23 April 1616  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son   Although no attendance records for the period survive  most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King s New School in Stratford  a free school chartered in 1553  about a quarter mile  400 m  from his home  Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era  but grammar school curricula were largely similar  the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors   At the age of 18  Shakespeare married the 26 year old Anne Hathaway  The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582  The next day  two of Hathaway s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage  The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste  since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times  and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter  Susanna  baptised 26 May 1583  Twins  son Hamnet and daughter Judith  followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585  Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596   After the birth of the twins  Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592  The exception is the appearance of his name in the  complaints bill  of a law case before the Queen s Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589  Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare s  lost years   Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories  Nicholas Rowe  Shakespeare s first biographer  recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy  Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him  Another 18th century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London  John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster  Some 20th century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire  a Catholic landowner who named a certain  William Shakeshafte  in his will  Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death  and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area   1 2  London and theatrical career  It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing  but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592  By then  he was sufficiently well known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats Worth of Wit      there is an upstart Crow  beautified with our feathers  that with his Tiger s heart wrapped in a Player s hide  supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you  and being an absolute Johannes factotum  is in his own conceit the only Shake scene in a country  Scholars differ on the exact meaning of these words  but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match university educated writers such as Christopher Marlowe  Thomas Nashe and Greene himself  the  university wits    The italicised phrase parodying the line  Oh  tiger s heart wrapped in a woman s hide  from Shakespeare s Henry VI  Part 3  along with the pun  Shake scene   identifies Shakespeare as Greene s target  Here Johannes Factotum— Jack of all trades — means a second rate tinkerer with the work of others  rather than the more common  universal genius    Greene s attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare s career in the theatre  Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid 1580s to just before Greene s remarks  From 1594  Shakespeare s plays were performed by only the Lord Chamberlain s Men  a company owned by a group of players  including Shakespeare  that soon became the leading playing company in London  After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603  the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king  James I  and changed its name to the King s Men   In 1599  a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames  which they called the Globe  In 1608  the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre  Records of Shakespeare s property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man  In 1597  he bought the second largest house in Stratford  New Place  and in 1605  he invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford   Some of Shakespeare s plays were published in quarto editions from 1594  By 1598  his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages  Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright  The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson s Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour  1598  and Sejanus His Fall  1603   The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson s Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end  The First Folio of 1623  however  lists Shakespeare as one of  the Principal Actors in all these Plays   some of which were first staged after Volpone  although we cannot know for certain which roles he played  In 1610  John Davies of Hereford wrote that  good Will  played  kingly  roles  In 1709  Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet s father  Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It and the Chorus in Henry V  though scholars doubt the sources of the information   Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career  In 1596  the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford  Shakespeare was living in the parish of St  Helen s  Bishopsgate  north of the River Thames  He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599  the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there  By 1604  he had moved north of the river again  to an area north of St Paul s Cathedral with many fine houses  There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy  a maker of ladies  wigs and other headgear   1 3  Later years and death  Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition  repeated by Johnson  that Shakespeare retired to Stratford  some years before his death   He was still working as an actor in London in 1608  in an answer to the sharers  petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans  the King s Men  placed men players  there   which were Heminges  Condell  Shakespeare  etc    However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609  The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague  a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610   which meant there was often no acting work  Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time  Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614  In 1612  he was called as a witness in Bellott v  Mountjoy  a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy s daughter  Mary  In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory  and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son in law  John Hall  After 1610  Shakespeare wrote fewer plays  and none are attributed to him after 1613  His last three plays were collaborations  probably with John Fletcher  who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King s Men   Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616  at the age of 52  He died within a month of signing his will  a document which he begins by describing himself as being in  perfect health   There is no extant contemporary source that explains how or why he died  After half a century had passed  John Ward  the vicar of Stratford  wrote in his notebook   Shakespeare  Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and  it seems  drank too hard  for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted   This is not impossible  for Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton  Of the tributes that started to come from fellow authors  one refers to his relatively early death   We wondered  Shakespeare  that thou went st so soon From the world s stage to the grave s tiring room    He was survived by his wife and two daughters  Susanna had married a physician  John Hall  in 1607  and Judith had married Thomas Quiney  a vintner  two months before Shakespeare s death  Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616  the following day his new son in law  Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler  who had died during childbirth  Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family   In his will  Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna  The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to  the first son of her body   The Quineys had three children  all of whom died without marrying  The Halls had one child  Elizabeth  who married twice but died without children in 1670  ending Shakespeare s direct line  Shakespeare s will scarcely mentions his wife  Anne  who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically  He did make a point  however  of leaving her  my second best bed   a bequest that has led to much speculation  Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne  whereas others believe that the second best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance   Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death  The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones  which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008   Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare  To digg the dvst encloased heare  Bleste be man spares thes stones  And cvrst be he moves my bones   Modern spelling  Good friend  for Jesus  sake forbear    To dig the dust enclosed here    Blessed be the man that spares these stones    And cursed be he that moves my bones    Sometime before 1623  a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall  with a half effigy of him in the act of writing  Its plaque compares him to Nestor  Socrates  and Virgil  In 1623  in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio  the Droeshout engraving was published   Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world  including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets  Corner in Westminster Abbey   2  Plays  Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point  and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same  mostly early and late in his career  Some attributions  such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays  remain controversial  while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well attested contemporary documentation  Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition   The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI  written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama  Shakespeare s plays are difficult to date  however  and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus  The Comedy of Errors  The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare s earliest period  His first histories  which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed s Chronicles of England  Scotland  and Ireland  dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty  The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists  especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe  by the traditions of medieval drama  and by the plays of Seneca  The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models  but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found  though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story  Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona  in which two friends appear to approve of rape  the Shrew s story of the taming of a woman s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors   Shakespeare s early classical and Italianate comedies  containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences  give way in the mid 1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies  A Midsummer Night s Dream is a witty mixture of romance  fairy magic  and comic lowlife scenes  Shakespeare s next comedy  the equally romantic Merchant of Venice  contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock  which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences  The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing  the charming rural setting of As You Like It  and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare s sequence of great comedies  After the lyrical Richard II  written almost entirely in verse  Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s  Henry IV  parts 1 and 2  and Henry V  His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes  prose and poetry  and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work  This period begins and ends with two tragedies  Romeo and Juliet  the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence  love  and death  and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North s 1579 translation of Plutarch s Parallel Lives—which introduced a new kind of drama  According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro  in Julius Caesar  the various strands of politics  character  inwardness  contemporary events  even Shakespeare s own reflections on the act of writing  began to infuse each other    In the early 17th century  Shakespeare wrote the so called  problem plays  Measure for Measure  Troilus and Cressida  and All s Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies  Many critics believe that Shakespeare s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art  The titular hero of one of Shakespeare s most famous tragedies  Hamlet  has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character  especially for his famous soliloquy which begins  To be or not to be  that is the question   Unlike the introverted Hamlet  whose fatal flaw is hesitation  the heroes of the tragedies that followed  Othello and King Lear  are undone by hasty errors of judgement  The plots of Shakespeare s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws  which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves  In Othello  the villain Iago stokes Othello s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him  In King Lear  the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers  initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear s youngest daughter Cordelia  According to the critic Frank Kermode   the play offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty   In Macbeth  the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare s tragedies  uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife  Lady Macbeth  to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne  until their own guilt destroys them in turn  In this play  Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure  His last major tragedies  Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus  contain some of Shakespeare s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T  S  Eliot   In his final period  Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays  Cymbeline  The Winter s Tale and The Tempest  as well as the collaboration  Pericles  Prince of Tyre  Less bleak than the tragedies  these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s  but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors  Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare s part  but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day  Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays  Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen  probably with John Fletcher   2 1  Performances  It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays  The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes  After the plagues of 1592–3  Shakespeare s plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch  north of the Thames  Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV  Leonard Digges recording   Let but Falstaff come  Hal  Poins  the rest   and you scarce shall have a room   When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord  they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre  the first playhouse built by actors for actors  on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark  The Globe opened in autumn 1599  with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged  Most of Shakespeare s greatest post 1599 plays were written for the Globe  including Hamlet  Othello and King Lear   After the Lord Chamberlain s Men were renamed the King s Men in 1603  they entered a special relationship with the new King James  Although the performance records are patchy  the King s Men performed seven of Shakespeare s plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605  including two performances of The Merchant of Venice  After 1608  they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer  The indoor setting  combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques  allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices  In Cymbeline  for example  Jupiter descends  in thunder and lightning  sitting upon an eagle  he throws a thunderbolt  The ghosts fall on their knees    The actors in Shakespeare s company included the famous Richard Burbage  William Kempe  Henry Condell and John Heminges  Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare s plays  including Richard III  Hamlet  Othello  and King Lear  The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing  among other characters  He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin  who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear  In 1613  Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII  was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony   On 29 June  however  a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground  an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision   2 2  Textual sources  In 1623  John Heminges and Henry Condell  two of Shakespeare s friends from the King s Men  published the First Folio  a collected edition of Shakespeare s plays  It contained 36 texts  including 18 printed for the first time  Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves  No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions  which the First Folio describes as  stol n and surreptitious copies   Alfred Pollard termed some of them  bad quartos  because of their adapted  paraphrased or garbled texts  which may in places have been reconstructed from memory  Where several versions of a play survive  each differs from the other  The differences may stem from copying or printing errors  from notes by actors or audience members  or from Shakespeare s own papers  In some cases  for example Hamlet  Troilus and Cressida and Othello  Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions  In the case of King Lear  however  while most modern editions do conflate them  the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto  that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both  arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion   3  Poems  In 1593 and 1594  when the theatres were closed because of plague  Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes  Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece  He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley  Earl of Southampton  In Venus and Adonis  an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus  while in The Rape of Lucrece  the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin  Influenced by Ovid s Metamorphoses  the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust  Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare s lifetime  A third narrative poem  A Lover s Complaint  in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor  was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609  Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover s Complaint  Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects  The Phoenix and the Turtle  printed in Robert Chester s 1601 Love s Martyr  mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover  the faithful turtle dove  In 1599  two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim  published under Shakespeare s name but without his permission   3 1  Sonnets  Published in 1609  the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare s non dramatic works to be printed  Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed  but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership  Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599  Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare s  sugred Sonnets among his private friends   Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare s intended sequence  He seems to have planned two contrasting series  one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion  the  dark lady    and one about conflicted love for a fair young man  the  fair youth    It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals  or if the authorial  I  who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself  though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets  Shakespeare unlocked his heart   The 1609 edition was dedicated to a  Mr  W H    credited as  the only begetter  of the poems  It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher  Thomas Thorpe  whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page  nor is it known who Mr  W H  was  despite numerous theories  or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication  Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love  sexual passion  procreation  death  and time   4  Style  Shakespeare s first plays were written in the conventional style of the day  He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama  The poetry depends on extended  sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits  and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak  The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus  in the view of some critics  often hold up the action  for example  and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted   Soon  however  Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes  The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self declaration of Vice in medieval drama  At the same time  Richard s vivid self awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare s mature plays  No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style  Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career  with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles  By the time of Romeo and Juliet  Richard II  and A Midsummer Night s Dream in the mid 1590s  Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry  He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself   Shakespeare s standard poetic form was blank verse  composed in iambic pentameter  In practice  this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line  spoken with a stress on every second syllable  The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones  It is often beautiful  but its sentences tend to start  pause  and finish at the end of lines  with the risk of monotony  Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse  he began to interrupt and vary its flow  This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet  Shakespeare uses it  for example  to convey the turmoil in Hamlet s mind   After Hamlet  Shakespeare varied his poetic style further  particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies  The literary critic A  C  Bradley described this style as  more concentrated  rapid  varied  and  in construction  less regular  not seldom twisted or elliptical   In the last phase of his career  Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects  These included run on lines  irregular pauses and stops  and extreme variations in sentence structure and length  In Macbeth  for example  the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another   was the hope drunk  Wherein you dressed yourself    1 7 35–38       pity  like a naked new born babe  Striding the blast  or heaven s cherubim  hors d  Upon the sightless couriers of the air      1 7 21–25   The listener is challenged to complete the sense  The late romances  with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot  inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another  clauses are piled up  subject and object are reversed  and words are omitted  creating an effect of spontaneity   Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre  Like all playwrights of the time  he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed  He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible  This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation  cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama  As Shakespeare s mastery grew  he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech  He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays  however  In Shakespeare s late romances  he deliberately returned to a more artificial style  which emphasised the illusion of theatre   5  Influence  Shakespeare s work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature  In particular  he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation  plot  language  and genre  Until Romeo and Juliet  for example  romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy  Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events  but Shakespeare used them to explore characters  minds  His work heavily influenced later poetry  The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama  though with little success  Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as  feeble variations on Shakespearean themes    Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy  William Faulkner  and Charles Dickens  The American novelist Herman Melville s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare  his Captain Ahab in Moby Dick is a classic tragic hero  inspired by King Lear  Scholars have identified 20 000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare s works  These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi  Otello and Falstaff  whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays  Shakespeare has also inspired many painters  including the Romantics and the Pre Raphaelites  The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli  a friend of William Blake  even translated Macbeth into German  The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology  in particular that of Hamlet  for his theories of human nature   In Shakespeare s day  English grammar  spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now  and his use of language helped shape modern English  Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language  the first serious work of its type  Expressions such as  with bated breath   Merchant of Venice  and  a foregone conclusion   Othello  have found their way into everyday English speech   6  Critical reputation  Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime  but he received a large amount of praise  In 1598  the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as  the most excellent  in both comedy and tragedy  The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John s College  Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer  Gower and Spenser  In the First Folio  Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the  Soul of the age  the applause  delight  the wonder of our stage   though he had remarked elsewhere that  Shakespeare wanted art   Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century  classical ideas were in vogue  As a result  critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson  Thomas Rymer  for example  condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic  Nevertheless  poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly  saying of Jonson   I admire him  but I love Shakespeare   For several decades  Rymer s view held sway  but during the 18th century  critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius  A series of scholarly editions of his work  notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790  added to his growing reputation  By 1800  he was firmly enshrined as the national poet  In the 18th and 19th centuries  his reputation also spread abroad  Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire  Goethe  Stendhal and Victor Hugo   During the Romantic era  Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge  and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism  In the 19th century  critical admiration for Shakespeare s genius often bordered on adulation   That King Shakespeare   the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840   does not he shine  in crowned sovereignty  over us all  as the noblest  gentlest  yet strongest of rallying signs  indestructible   The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale  The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as  bardolatry   claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen s plays had made Shakespeare obsolete   The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century  far from discarding Shakespeare  eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant garde  The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays  Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare  The poet and critic T S  Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare s  primitiveness  in fact made him truly modern  Eliot  along with G  Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism  led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare s imagery  In the 1950s  a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for  post modern  studies of Shakespeare  By the 1980s  Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism  feminism  New Historicism  African American studies  and queer studies  In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare s works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well  Harold Bloom has commented that   Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St  Augustine  He encloses us  because we see with his fundamental perceptions    7  Speculation about Shakespeare  7 1  Authorship  Around 230 years after Shakespeare s death  doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him  Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon  Christopher Marlowe  and Edward de Vere  17th Earl of Oxford  Several  group theories  have also been proposed  Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution  but interest in the subject  particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship  continues into the 21st century   7 2  Religion  Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare s family were Catholics  at a time when Catholic practice was against the law  Shakespeare s mother  Mary Arden  certainly came from a pious Catholic family  The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare  found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street  The document is now lost  however  and scholars differ as to its authenticity  In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church  for fear of process for debt   a common Catholic excuse  In 1606 the name of William s daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford  As several scholars have noted  whatever his private views  Shakespeare  conformed to the official state religion   as Park Honan put it  Shakespeare s will uses a Protestant formula and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England  where he got married  his children were baptized  and where he was buried  Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare s religious beliefs  Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare s Catholicism  Protestantism  or lack of belief in his plays  but the truth may be impossible to prove   7 3  Sexuality  Few details of Shakespeare s sexuality are known  At 18  he married the 26 year old Anne Hathaway  who was pregnant  Susanna  the first of their three children  was born six months later on 26 May 1583  Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare s sonnets are autobiographical  and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man  Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than sexual love  The 26 so called  Dark Lady  sonnets  addressed to a married woman  are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons   7 4  Portraiture  No written contemporary description of Shakespeare s physical appearance survives  and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait  so the Droeshout engraving  which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness  and his Stratford monument provide the best evidence of his appearance  From the 18th century  the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare  That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits  as well as mis attributions  repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people   8  List of works  8 1  Classification of the plays  Shakespeare s works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623  listed according to their folio classification as comedies  histories and tragedies  Two plays not included in the First Folio  The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles  Prince of Tyre  are now accepted as part of the canon  with scholars agreed that Shakespeare made a major contribution to their composition  No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio   In the late 19th century  Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances  and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies  his term is often used  These plays and the associated Two Noble Kinsmen are marked with an asterisk  *  below  In 1896  Frederick S  Boas coined the term  problem plays  to describe four plays  All s Well That Ends Well  Measure for Measure  Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet   Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies   he wrote   We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare s problem plays   The term  much debated and sometimes applied to other plays  remains in use  though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy   9  See also  English Renaissance theatre  World Shakespeare
