In complex analysis  a branch of mathematics  the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem describes the behaviour of holomorphic functions near their essential singularities  It is named for Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass and Felice Casorati  In Russian literature it is called Sokhotski s theorem   1  Formal statement of the theorem  Start with some open subset U in the complex plane containing the number   and a function f that is holomorphic on   but has an essential singularity at    The Casorati–Weierstrass theorem then states that  This can also be stated as follows   Or in still more descriptive terms   This form of the theorem also applies if f is only meromorphic   The theorem is considerably strengthened by Picard s great theorem  which states  in the notation above  that f assumes every complex value  with one possible exception  infinitely often on V   In the case that f is an entire function and a 蜴  the theorem says that the values f z  approach every complex number and 蜴  as z tends to infinity  It is remarkable that this does not hold for holomorphic maps in higher dimensions  as the famous example of Pierre Fatou shows   2  Examples  The function f z    exp 1 z  has an essential singularity at 0  but the function g z    1 z3 does not  it has a pole at 0    Consider the function  This function has the following Laurent series about the essential singular point at 0   Because exists for all points z ≠ 0 we know that ƒ z  is analytic in a punctured neighborhood of z   0  Hence it is an isolated singularity  as well as being an essential singularity   Using a change of variable to polar coordinates our function  ƒ z    e1 z becomes   Taking the absolute value of both sides   Thus  for values of θ such that cos θ   0  we have as   and for   as    Consider what happens  for example when z takes values on a circle of diameter 1 R tangent to the imaginary axis  This circle is given by r    1 R  cos θ  Then   and  Thus  may take any positive value other than zero by the appropriate choice of R  As on the circle  with R fixed  So this part of the equation   takes on all values on the unit circle infinitely often  Hence f z  takes on the value of every number in the complex plane except for zero infinitely often   3  Proof of the theorem  A short proof of the theorem is as follows   Take as given that function f is meromorphic on some punctured neighborhood V \  z0   and that z0 is an essential singularity  Assume by way of contradiction that some value b exists that the function can never get close to  that is  assume that there is some complex value b and some ε   0 such that  f z  蜢 b  ≥ ε for all z in V at which f is defined   Then the new function   must be holomorphic on V \  z0   with zeroes at the poles of f  and bounded by 1 ε  It can therefore be analytically continued  or continuously extended  or holomorphically extended  to all of V by Riemann s analytic continuation theorem  So the original function can be expressed in terms of g   for all arguments z in V \  z0   Consider the two possible cases for  If the limit is 0  then f has a pole at z0   If the limit is not 0  then z0 is a removable singularity of f   Both possibilities contradict the assumption that the point z0 is an essential singularity of the function f   Hence the assumption is false and the theorem holds   4  History  The history of this important theorem is described by Collingwood and Lohwater  It was published by Weierstrass in 1876  in German  and by Sokhotski in 1873  in Russian   So it was called Sokhotski s theorem in the Russian literature and Weierstrass s theorem in the Western literature  The same theorem was published by Casorati in 1868  and by Briot and Bouquet in the first edition of their book  1859   However  Briot and Bouquet removed this theorem from the second edition  1875    5  References  Section 31  Theorem 2  pp  124–125  of
