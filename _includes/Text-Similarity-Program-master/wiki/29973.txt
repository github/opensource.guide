Turmeric  Curcuma longa  is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant of the ginger family  Zingiberaceae  It is native in southeast India  and needs temperatures between 20 and 30°C  68 and 86°F  and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive  Plants are gathered annually for their rhizomes  and propagated from some of those rhizomes in the following season   When not used fresh  the rhizomes are boiled for about 30–45 minutes and then dried in hot ovens  after which they are ground into a deep orange yellow powder commonly used as a spice in Indian cuisine and curries  for dyeing  and to impart color to mustard condiments  One active ingredient in it is curcumin  It has a distinctly earthy  slightly bitter  slightly hot peppery flavor and a mustardy smell   India  a

years and is a major part of Siddha medicine  It was first used as a dye and then later for its medicinal properties   The name appears to derive from Middle English early modern English as turmeryte or tarmaret having uncertain origin  There may be Latin origin  terra merita  merited earth    The name of the genus  Curcuma is from an Arabic name of both saffron and turmeric  see Crocus    2  Botanical description  2 1  Appearance  Turmeric is a perennial herbaceous plant  which reaches up to 1 m tall  Highly branched  yellow to orange  cylindrical  aromatic rhizomes are found  The leaves are alternate and arranged in two rows   They are divided into leaf sheath  petiole  and leaf blade  From the leaf sheaths  a false stem is formed  The petiole is 50 to 115 cm long  The simple leaf blades are usually 76 to 115 cm long and rarely up to 230 cm  They have a width of 38 to 45 cm and are oblong to elliptic narrowing at the tip    2 2  Inflorescence  flower  and fruit  In China  the flowering time is usually in August  Terminally on the false stem is a 12  to 20 cm long inflorescence stem containing many flowers  The bracts are light green and ovate to oblong with a blunt upper end with a length of 3 to 5 cm   At the top of the inflorescence  stem bracts are present on which no flowers occur  these are white to green and sometimes tinged reddish purple and the upper ends are tapered   The hermaphrodite flowers are zygomorphic and threefold  The three 0 8  to 1 2 cm long sepals are fused  white  have fluffy hairs and the three calyx teeth are unequal  The three bright yellow petals are fused into a corolla tube up to 3 cm long  The three corolla lobes have a length of 1 0 to 1 5 cm  and are triangular with soft spiny upper ends  While the average corolla lobe is larger than the two lateral  only the median stamen of the inner circle is fertile  The dust bag is spurred at its base  All other stamens are converted to staminodes  The outer staminodes are shorter than the labellum  The labellum is yellowish  with a yellow ribbon in its center and it is obovate  with a length from 1 2 to 2 0 cm  Three carpels are under a constant  trilobed ovary adherent  which is sparsely hairy  The fruit capsule opens with three compartments   3  Biochemical composition  The most important chemical components of turmeric are a group of compounds called curcuminoids  which include curcumin  diferuloylmethane   demethoxycurcumin  and bisdemethoxycurcumin  The best studied compound is curcumin  which constitutes 3 14%  on average  of powdered turmeric  In addition  other important volatile oils include turmerone  atlantone  and zingiberene  Some general constituents are sugars  proteins  and resins   4  Uses  4 1  Culinary  Turmeric grows wild in the forests of South and Southeast Asia  It is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes  Indian traditional medicine  called Siddha  has recommended turmeric for medicine  Its use as a coloring agent is not of primary value in South Asian cuisine   Turmeric is mostly used in savory dishes  but is used in some sweet dishes  such as the cake sfouf  In India  turmeric plant leaf is used to prepare special sweet dishes  patoleo  by layering rice flour and coconut jaggery mixture on the leaf  and then closing and steaming it in a special copper steamer  goa    In recipes outside South Asia  turmeric is sometimes used as an agent to impart a rich  custard like yellow color  It is used in canned beverages  baked products  dairy products  ice cream  yogurt  yellow cakes  orange juice  biscuits  popcorn color  cereals  sauces  gelatins  etc  It is a significant ingredient in most commercial curry powders   Most turmeric is used in the form of rhizome powder  in some regions  especially in Maharashtra  Goa  Konkan and Kanara   turmeric leaves are used to wrap and cook food  Turmeric leaves are mainly used in this way in areas where turmeric is grown locally  since the leaves used are freshly picked  Turmeric leaves impart a distinctive flavor   Although typically used in its dried  powdered form  turmeric is also used fresh  like ginger  It has numerous uses in Far Eastern recipes  such as pickle that contains large chunks of soft turmeric  made from fresh turmeric   Turmeric is widely used as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking  Many Persian dishes use turmeric as a starter ingredient  Almost all Iranian fried dishes consist of oil  onions  and turmeric followed by any other ingredients   In India and Nepal  turmeric is widely grown and extensively used in many vegetable and meat dishes for its color  and is also used for its supposed value in traditional medicine   In South Africa  turmeric is used to give boiled white rice a golden colour   In Vietnamese cuisine  turmeric powder is used to color and enhance the flavors of certain dishes  such as bánh xèo  bánh khọt  and mi quang  The powder is also used in many other Vietnamese stir fried and soup dishes   In Indonesia  turmeric leaves are used for Minangese or Padangese curry base of Sumatra  such as rendang  sate padang  and many other varieties   In Thailand  fresh turmeric rhizomes are widely used in many dishes  in particular in the southern Thai cuisine  such as the yellow curry  แกงเหลือง  and turmeric soup  ต้มขมิ้น    In medieval Europe  turmeric became known as Indian saffron because it was widely used as an alternative to the far more expensive saffron spice   4 2  Folk medicine and traditional uses  In India  turmeric has been used traditionally for thousands of years as a remedy for stomach and liver ailments  as well as topically to heal sores  basically for its supposed antimicrobial property  In the Siddha system  since around 1900 BCE  turmeric was a medicine for a range of diseases and conditions  including those of the skin  pulmonary  and gastrointestinal systems  aches  pains  wounds  sprains  and liver disorders  A fresh juice is commonly used in many skin conditions  including eczema  chicken pox  shingles  allergy  and scabies   The active compound curcumin is believed to have a wide range of biological effects including anti inflammatory  antioxidant  antitumour  antibacterial  and antiviral activities  which indicate potential in clinical medicine   4 3  Preliminary medical research  According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine   there is little reliable evidence to support the use of turmeric for any health condition because few clinical trials have been conducted    Although trials are going on for the use of turmeric to treat cancer  doses needed for any effect are difficult to establish in humans   Some research shows compounds in turmeric to have antifungal and antibacterial properties  however  curcumin is not one of them   As of December 2013  turmeric is being evaluated for its potential efficacy against several human diseases in clinical trials  including kidney and cardiovascular diseases  arthritis  several types of cancer  and irritable bowel disease  Turmeric is also being investigated for potential treatment of Alzheimer s disease  diabetes  and other clinical disorders   4 4  Dye  Turmeric makes a poor fabric dye  as it is not very light fast  but is commonly used in Indian and Bangladeshi clothing  such as saris and Buddhist monks  robes  Turmeric  coded as E100 when used as a food additive  is used to protect food products from sunlight  The oleoresin is used for oil containing products  A curcumin and polysorbate solution or curcumin powder dissolved in alcohol is used for water containing products  Over coloring  such as in pickles  relishes  and mustard  is sometimes used to compensate for fading   In combination with annatto  E160b   turmeric has been used to color cheeses  yogurt  dry mixes  salad dressings  winter butter and margarine  Turmeric is also used to give a yellow color to some prepared mustards  canned chicken broths  and other foods  often as a much cheaper replacement for saffron    Turmeric paper  paper steeped in a tincture of turmeric and allowed to dry  is used in chemical analysis as an indicator for acidity and alkalinity   4 5  Ceremonial uses  Turmeric is considered highly auspicious and holy in India and has been used extensively in various Hindu ceremonies for centuries  Even today  it is used in every part of India during wedding ceremonies and religious ceremonies   Turmeric has played an important role in Hindu spiritualism  The robes of the Hindu monks were traditionally colored with a yellow dye made of turmeric  Because of its yellow orange coloring  turmeric was associated with the sun or the Thirumal in the mythology of ancient Tamil religion  Yellow is the color of the solar plexus chakra  which in traditional Tamil Siddha medicine is the energy center relating to the metabolic and digestive systems  Orange is the color of the sacral chakra  and tied to the reproductive system   The plant is used in poosai to represent a form of Kottravai  who is said to reside on this plant as herself  The plant is used as a component of navapatrika along with plantain  banana   taro  kachvi  kacci  or kochu  or barley  jayanti   wood apple  bilva   pomegranate  darimba   asoka  manaka  or manakochu and dhanya   It is used in poosai to make a form of Ganesha  Yaanaimugathaan  the remover of obstacles  is invoked at the beginning of almost any ceremony and a form of Yaanaimugathaan for this purpose is made by mixing turmeric with water and forming it into a cone like shape   Gaye holud  literally  yellow on the body   is a ceremony observed mostly in the region of Bengal  comprising Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal   The gaye holud takes place one or two days before the religious and legal Bengali wedding ceremonies  The turmeric paste is applied by friends to the bodies of the couple  This is said to soften the skin  but also colors them with the distinctive yellow hue that gives its name to this ceremony  It may be a joint event for the bride and groom s families  or it may consist of separate events for the bride s family and the groom s family   During the Tamil festival Pongal  a whole turmeric plant with fresh rhizomes is offered as a thanksgiving offering to Suryan  the sun god  Also  the fresh plant sometimes is tied around the sacred Pongal pot in which an offering of pongal is prepared   In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh  as a part of the Tamil Telugu marriage ritual  dried turmeric tuber tied with string is used temporarily or permanently as opposed to the Mangalasutra of Hindus in India   The Tamil marriage act recognizes this custom  Thali necklace is the equivalent of marriage rings in western cultures  In western and coastal India  during weddings of the Marathi and Konkani people  Kannada Brahmins turmeric tubers are tied with strings by the couple to their wrists during a ceremony called Kankanabandhana   Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind reported in 1896 that in Micronesia  the preparation of turmeric powder for embellishment of body  clothing  and utensils had a highly ceremonial character  He quotes an example of the roots being ground by four to six women in special public buildings and then allowed to stand in water  The following morning  three young coconuts and three old soma nuts are offered by a priestess with prayer  after which the dye which has settled down in the water is collected  baked into cakes in coconut molds  wrapped in banana leaves  and hung up in the huts till required for use   5  Possibility of lead contamination  As turmeric and other spices are commonly sold by weight  the potential exists in modern times for cutting with powders of toxic agents having similar color  such as lead oxide  giving turmeric an orange red color instead of its native gold yellow   6  See also  Alpinia zerumbet  Curcuma xanthorrhiza  Curcuma
