The term Third World arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non aligned with either NATO  or the Communist Bloc  The United States  Western European nations and their allies representing the First World  The Soviet Union  China  Cuba  and their allies representing the Second World  This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on social  political  cultural and economic divisions  The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa  Latin America  Oceania and Asia  It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the Non Aligned Movement  In the so called dependency theory of thinkers like Raul Prebisch  Walter Rodney  Theotonio dos Santos  and Andre Gunder Frank  the Third World has also been connected to the world economic division as  periphery  countries in the world system that is dominated by the  core  countries   Due to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts  there is no clear or agreed upon definition of the Third World  Some countries in the Communist Bloc  such as Cuba  were often regarded as  Third World   Because many Third World countries were extremely poor  and non industrialized  it became a stereotype to refer to poor countries as  third world countries   yet the  Third World  term is also often taken to include newly industrialized countries like Brazil or China  Historically  some European countries were part of the non aligned movement and a few were and are very prosperous  including Austria  Ireland and Switzerland   Over the last few decades since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War  the term Third World has been used interchangeably with the least developed countries  Global South and developing countries to describe poorer countries that have struggled to attain steady economic development  a term that often includes  Second World  countries like Laos  This usage  however  has become less preferred in recent years  Recently the term Majority World has come into use  since most people of the world live in poorer and less developed countries   1  Etymology  French demographer  anthropologist and historian Alfred Sauvy  in an article published in the French magazine L Observateur  August 14  1952  coined the term Third World  referring to countries that were unaligned with either the Communist Soviet bloc or the Capitalist NATO bloc during the Cold War  His usage was a reference to the Third Estate  the commoners of France who  before and during the French Revolution  opposed the clergy and nobles  who composed the First Estate and Second Estate  respectively  Sauvy wrote   This third world ignored  exploited  despised like the third estate also wants to be something   He conveyed the concept of political non alignment with either the capitalist or communist bloc   2  Third World vs  Three Worlds  The  Three Worlds Theory  developed by Mao Zedong is different from the Western theory of the Three Worlds or Third World  For example  in the Western theory  China and India belong respectively to the second and third worlds  but in Mao s theory both China and India are part of the Third World which he defined as consisting of exploited nations   3  Third Worldism  Third Worldism is a political movement that argues for the unity of third world nations against first world influence and the principle of non interference in other countries  domestic affairs  Groups most notable for expressing and exercising this idea are the Non Aligned Movement  NAM  and the Group of 77 which provide a base for relations and diplomacy between not just the third world countries  but between the third world and the first and second worlds  The notion has been criticized as providing a fig leaf for human rights violations and political repression by dictatorships   4  History  Most Third World countries were former colonies  Having gained independence many of these countries  especially smaller ones  were faced with the challenges of nation and institution building on their own for the first time  Due to this common background  many of these nations were  developing  in economic terms for most of the 20th century  and many still are  This term  used today  generally denotes countries that have not developed to the same levels as OECD countries  and are thus in the process of developing   In the 1980s  economist Peter Bauer offered a competing definition for the term  Third World   He claimed that the attachment of Third World status to a particular country was not based on any stable economic or political criteria  and was a mostly arbitrary process  The large diversity of countries considered part of the Third World—from Indonesia to Afghanistan—ranged widely from economically primitive to economically advanced and from politically non aligned to Soviet or Western leaning  An argument could also be made for how parts of the U S  are more like the Third World  The only characteristic that Bauer found common in all Third World countries was that their governments  demand and receive Western aid   the giving of which he strongly opposed  Thus  the aggregate term  Third World  was challenged as misleading even during the Cold War period because it had no consistent or collective identity among the countries it supposedly encompassed   5  Foreign aid and development  During the Cold War  unaligned countries of the Third World were seen as potential allies by both the First and Second World  Therefore  the United States and the Soviet Union went to great lengths to establish connections in these countries by offering economic and military support to gain strategically located alliances  e g   United States in Vietnam or Soviet Union in Cuba   By the end of the Cold War  many Third World countries had adopted capitalist or communist economic models and continued to receive support from the side they had chosen  Throughout the Cold War and beyond  the countries of the Third World have been the priority recipients of Western foreign aid and the focus of economic development through mainstream theories such as modernization theory and dependency theory   By the end of the 1960s  the idea of the Third World came to represent countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America that were considered underdeveloped by the West based on a variety of characteristics  low economic development  low life expectancy  high rates of poverty and disease  etc    These countries became the targets for aid and support from governments  NGOs and individuals from wealthier nations  One popular model  known as Rostow s stages of growth  argued that development took place in 5 stages  Traditional Society  Pre conditions for Take off  Take off  Drive to Maturity  Age of High Mass Consumption   W  W  Rostow argued that Take off was the critical stage that the Third World was missing or struggling with  Thus  foreign aid was needed to help kick start industrialization and economic growth in these countries   However  despite decades of receiving aid and experiencing different development models  which have had very little success   many Third World countries  economies are still dependent on developed countries and are deep in debt  There is now a growing debate about why Third World countries remain impoverished and underdeveloped after all this time  Many argue that current methods of aid are not working and are calling for reducing foreign aid  and therefore dependency  and utilizing different economic theories than the traditional mainstream theories from the West  Historically  development and aid have not accomplished the goals they were meant to and currently the global gap between the rich and poor is greater than ever  though not everybody agrees with this   Some scholars argue the problem of development amongst many third world states through socioeconomic perspectives which study how individuals form organizations amongst each other for all kinds of goals such as economic matters  Scholars like North and Weingast claim that modern states are composed of natural states and open access order states whereby open access order states have more positive development than natural states because in these states  legally binding institutions  rules of the game  customs  allow individuals to freely form impersonal organizations that can attract a large group of people who work or compete with each other economically  The more competition  the more wealth and growth is created  Examples of open access states are many Western countries like America and Germany  In contrast  a natural state  which compromises much of the third world  consists of political elites who try to protect their special privileges by restricting access to the ability to form organizations amongst individuals  These elites must rely on personal communication and the threat of violence to both maintain order and recruit  desirables  into the organizations  Such a set up not only weakens good governance  as leaders are less accountable  but also leads to weak institutions where peace is not always assured as those in control of the means to inflict violence simply restrain themselves out of trust or loyalty and can easily resort to violence as has happened in the past  e g   Biafra against the rest of Nigeria  Bangladesh against the rest of Pakistan    Over the last few decades  global population growth has largely been focused in Third World countries  which often have higher birth rates than developed countries   As populations expand in poorer countries  rural people are flocking to cities in an extensive urban migration that is resulting in the creation of massive shanty towns and slums  Many times there is a clear distinction between First and Third Worlds  When talking about the Global North and the Global South  the majority of the time the two go hand in hand  People refer to the two as  Third World South  and  First World North  because the Global North is more affluent and developed  whereas the Global South is less developed and often poorer  though after the late 1980s this started to be changed by the Great Convergence   6  See also  Fourth World  North–South divide  Third World Socialism
