According to the CIA World Factbook  as of July 2012  the global crude death rate is 7 99 deaths 1 000 population  The crude death rate represents the total number of deaths per year per thousand people  Comparatively  the crude death rate in the year 1900 was 17 2 deaths 1 000 population and 9 6 deaths 1 000 population in 1950 in America   1  Highest crude death rates worldwide  CIA  The World Fact book  2  Cause of death  Throughout the 20th century in the developed world  the leading causes of death transitioned from infectious diseases such as influenza  to degenerative diseases such as cancer or diabetes  In 1900  the leading cause of death in the United States was influenza with 202 2 deaths per 100 000 people followed by tuberculosis with 194 4  which is a curable illness today  In the middle of 20th century America  the leading cause of death was heart disease with an impressive 355 5 deaths per 100 000 followed by cancer at 139 8 deaths per 100 000  Although death rates dropped significantly in the latter part of the 20th century  the leading killers are still constant  The United States saw 192 9 people per 100 000 die from heart disease in 2010 followed by cancer with 185 9 people per 100 000   The world population in the 20th century experienced a large amount of death due to two major world wars  World War II was responsible for the most war related deaths in the 1900s with a death toll between 40 000 000 and 72 000 000 deaths  Other predominate wars in the 1900s include World War I with up to 65 000 000 deaths  the Russian Civil War with up to 9 000 000 deaths  the Afghan Civil War with up to 2 000 000 deaths  and the Mexican Revolution with up to 2 000 000 deaths  Several other major wars took place in the 20th century  such as the Iran Iraq war  the Soviet War in Afghanistan  the second Sudanese civil war  the Korean War and the Vietnam war   It is estimated that car accidents caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century   3  Aging population  A natural population increase occurs when birth rates are higher than death rates  Recently and most notably  the years immediately after World War II saw an explosion in birth rates called the Baby Boom as returning soldiers and displaced people started new families  Death rates were significantly lower during the baby boom and thus populations increased substantially  Today these baby boomers are approaching old age and driving up the average age of the overall population  The World Bank predicts a dramatic decrease in population size from the increase in death rates over the next decade or so   Fertility rates and consequently live birth rates declined over the century  while age adjusted death rates fell more dramatically  Children in 1999 were 10 times less likely to die than children in 1900   For adults 24–65  death rates have been halved  The death rate for Americans aged 65 to 74 fell from nearly 7% per year to fewer than 2% per year   The introduction of vaccines for several diseases led to reduced mortality from them  Again developed countries felt the greatest benefit  In the 20th century  vaccines became available for many diseases which caused deaths  diphtheria  pertussis  tuberculosis  tetanus  yellow fever  polio  measles  hepatitis among others   However  war  genocide and Holocausts have led to many millions of deaths throughout the century  and late in the century AIDS had already killed millions  particularly in Africa and south east Asia  Cancer also killed millions via lifestyle and pollution generated by industrialisation   4  Improvements in public health  During the 20th century  an enormous improvement in public health led to an overall decrease in death rates  Infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates have dramatically decreased  In the early 1900s  6 9 women died in pregnancy related complications for every 1 000 births  while 100 infants died before they were 1 year old  In 1999  at the end of the century  the infant mortality rate in the United States declined more than 90% to 7 2 deaths per 1 000 live births  Similarly  maternal mortality rates declined almost 99% to less than 0 1 reported deaths per 1 000 live births   There are a variety of causes for this steep decline in death rates in the 20th century   • Environmental interventions  • Improvement in nutrition  • Advances in clinical medicine  sulfonamide in 1937  penicillin in the 1940s   • Improved access to health care  • Improvements in surveillance and monitoring disease  • Increases in education levels  • Improvement in standards of living   Despite these tremendous decreases in infant mortality and maternal mortality  the 20th century experienced significant disparities between minority death rates compared to death rates for white mothers  In the 1900s  black women were twice as likely to die while giving birth compared to white women  Towards the end of the 20th century  black women are three times as likely to die while giving birth  This disparity is often cited as a lack in stronger Health care in the United States   5  See also  List of countries by death rate
