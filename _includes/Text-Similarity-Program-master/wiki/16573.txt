James Robert Flynn PhD FRSNZ  born 1934   aka Jim Flynn  Emeritus Professor of Political Studies at the University of Otago in Dunedin  New Zealand  researches intelligence and is famous for his publications about the continued year after year increase of IQ scores throughout the world  which is now referred to as the Flynn effect  The Flynn Effect is the subject of a multiple author monograph published by the American Psychological Association in 1998  Originally from Washington DC and educated in Chicago  Flynn emigrated to New Zealand in 1963   Flynn s son Victor is a mathematics professor at New College  Oxford   1  Academic work  Flynn has written a variety of books  His research interests include humane ideals and ideological debate  classics of political philosophy  and race  class and IQ  see race and intelligence   His books combine political and moral philosophy with psychology to examine problems such as justifying humane ideals and whether it makes sense to rank races and classes by merit  He is currently a member of the editorial board of Intelligence and on the Honorary International Advisory Editorial Board of the Mens Sana Monographs   Flynn defines intelligence to be independent of culture  emphasising that the style of thought required to deal with problems of survival in a desert  mapping  tracking     is different from that required to do well in the modern West  academic achievement etc    but that both undoubtedly require intelligence   In 1987  Arthur Jensen praised Flynn s criticism of Jensen s own work in a chapter summarizing a festschrift about Jensen s research on human intelligence   Now and then I am asked by colleagues  students  and journalists  who  in my opinion  are the most respectable critics of my position on the race IQ issue  The name James R  Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind  His book  Race  IQ and Jensen  1980   is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic  and  among the critiques I have seen of my position  is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity  thoroughness  and scholarly integrity  A 1999 article published in American Psychologist  summarises much of his research  On the alleged genetic inferiority of Blacks on IQ tests  he lays out the argument and evidence for such a belief  and then contests each point  He interprets the direct evidence—when Blacks are raised in settings that are less disadvantageous—as suggesting that environmental factors explain genetic differences  And yet  he argues that the environmental explanation gained force after the discovery that IQ scores were rising over time  Inter generational IQ differences among Whites and across nations were larger than the Black White IQ Gap and could not be accounted for by genetic factors  which  if anything  should have reduced IQ  according to scholars he references  He posits that the Black White IQ score gap can be entirely explained by environmental factors if  the average environment for Blacks in 1995 matches the quality of the average environment for Whites in 1945   However in more recent work  Flynn moves away from this latter claim  stating  American blacks are not in a time warp so that the environmental causes of their IQ gap with whites are identical to the environmental causes of the IQ gap between the generations   and  The Flynn Effect is irrelevant to showing that the racial IQ gap is environmental   Flynn s 2007 book What Is Intelligence  impressed Charles Murray  a co author of the book The Bell Curve  who wrote in a statement published on the book s back cover   This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work  much of which was new to me  All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt    Flynn is transparent about his belief in racial equality in his work  but he advocates for open scientific debate about controversial social science claims and is critical of the suppression of research into race and intelligence  where  courses are taught on the The Bell Curve that do not assign the Bell Curve  where courses on intelligence are not offered simply because some student might raise the question of racial differences  where someone taking IQ seriously would be ostracized in an education or gender studies department  where the history of the black family is distorted for political purposes  where scholars rise in wrath when a speaker details obvious ethnic differences   He only urges those with related beliefs to refrain from advancing them without solid evidence   Flynn s 2010 book The Torchlight List proposes the controversial idea that a person can learn more from reading great works of literature than they can from going to university   2  Flynn effect  The Flynn effect is the name given to a substantial and long sustained increase in intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world  When intelligence quotient  IQ  tests are initially standardised using a sample of test takers  by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 IQ points  When IQ tests are revised they are again standardised using a new sample of test takers  usually born more recently than the first  Again  the average result is set to 100  However  when the new test subjects take the older tests  in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100   Test score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present  For the Raven s Progressive Matrices test  subjects born over a 100 year period were compared in Des Moines  Iowa  and separately in Dumfries  Scotland  Improvements were remarkably consistent across the whole period  in both countries  This effect of an apparent increase in IQ has also been observed in various other parts of the world  though the rates of increase vary   There are numerous proposed explanations of the Flynn effect  as well as some scepticism about its implications  Similar improvements have been reported for other cognitions such as semantic and episodic memory  Recent research suggests that the Flynn effect may have ended in at least a few developed nations  possibly allowing national differences in IQ scores to diminish if the Flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national IQs   3  Political activities  In 1967  Flynn served as a chairperson for the Congress of Racial Equality  CORE   a civil rights organisation in the US South   Flynn campaigns passionately for left wing causes  and became an initiating member of both the NewLabour Party and of the Alliance  He also advised Labour Prime Minister Norman Kirk on foreign policy  He has stood as a parliamentary candidate in general elections on several occasions  for example in the electorate in the and s on the Alliance list  and most recently in again as an Alliance list candidate  In 2008 he acted as the Alliance spokesperson for finance and taxation   4  Controversial remarks  During 2007  new research from the 2006 New Zealand census showed that women without a tertiary  college  education had produced 2 57 babies each  compared to 1 85 babies for those women with a higher education  During July 2007  The Sunday Star Times quoted Flynn as saying that New Zealand risked having a less intelligent population and that a  persistent genetic trend which lowered the genetic quality for brain physiology would have some effect eventually   He referred to hypothetical eugenicists  suggestions for reversing the trend  including some sort of oral contraceptive  in the water supply and     an antidote  to conceive   Flynn later articulated his own views on the Close Up television program in an interview with Paul Henry  suggesting that the Sunday Star Times had grossly misrepresented his opinions  In the article  Flynn argued that he never intended for his suggestion to be taken seriously  as he only said this to illustrate a particular point   In July 2012  several media outlets reported Flynn as claiming that women had  for the first time in a century  surpassed men on IQ tests based on a study he conducted in 2010  However  Flynn announced that the media had seriously distorted his results and went beyond his claims  revealing that he had instead discovered that the differences between men and women on one particular test  the Raven s Progressive Matrices  had become minimal in five modernised nations  whereas before 1982 women had scored significantly lower   Women  he argued  caught up to men in these nations as a result of exposure to modernity by entering the professions and being allowed greater educational access  Therefore  he claimed  when a total account of the Flynn Effect is considered  women s closing the gap had moved them up in IQ slightly faster than men as a result  Flynn had previously documented this same trend among ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups  According to Flynn  the sexes are  dead equal on cognitive factors       in their ability to deal with using logic on the abstract problems of Raven s   but that temperamental differences in the way boys and girls take the tests likely account for the tiny variations in mean scores  rather than any difference in intellectual ability   5  Partial bibliography    Reviews the debate  as of 1980  about the research of Arthur Jensen and his critics   6  Further reading  7  Notes  8  External
