The flowering plants  angiosperms   also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta  are the most diverse group of land plants  Angiosperms are seed producing plants like the gymnosperms and can be distinguished from the gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers  endosperm within the seeds  and the production of fruits that contain the seeds  Etymologically  angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure  in other words  a fruiting plant   The ancestors of flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms around 245–202 million years ago  and the first flowering plants known to exist are from 160 million years ago  They diversified enormously during the Lower Cretaceous and became widespread around 120 million years ago  but replaced conifers as the dominant trees only around 60–100 million years ago   1  Angiosperm derived characteristics  Flowers The flowers  which are the reproductive organs of flowering plants  are the most remarkable feature distinguishing them from the other seed plants  Flowers provided angiosperms with the means to have a more species specific breeding system  and hence a way to evolve more readily into different species without the risk of crossing back with related species  Faster speciation enabled the Angiosperms to adapt to a wider range of ecological niches  This has allowed flowering plants to largely dominate terrestrial ecosystems   Stamens with two pairs of pollen sacs Stamens are much lighter than the corresponding organs of gymnosperms and have contributed to the diversification of angiosperms through time with adaptations to specialized pollination syndromes  such as particular pollinators  Stamens have also become modified through time to prevent self fertilization  which has permitted further diversification  allowing angiosperms eventually to fill more niches   Reduced male parts  three cells The male gametophyte in angiosperms is significantly reduced in size compared to those of gymnosperm seed plants  The smaller size of the pollen reduces the amount of time between pollination — the pollen grain reaching the female plant — and fertilization  In gymnosperms  fertilization can occur up to a year after pollination  whereas in angiosperms  fertilization begins very soon after pollination  The shorter amount of time between pollination and fertilization allows angiosperms to produce seeds earlier after pollination than gymnosperms  providing angiosperms a distinct evolutionary advantage   Closed carpel enclosing the ovules  carpel or carpels and accessory parts may become the fruit  The closed carpel of angiosperms also allows adaptations to specialized pollination syndromes and controls  This helps to prevent self fertilization  thereby maintaining increased diversity  Once the ovary is fertilized  the carpel and some surrounding tissues develop into a fruit  This fruit often serves as an attractant to seed dispersing animals  The resulting cooperative relationship presents another advantage to angiosperms in the process of dispersal   Reduced female gametophyte  seven cells with eight nuclei The reduced female gametophyte  like the reduced male gametophyte  may be an adaptation allowing for more rapid seed set  eventually leading to such flowering plant adaptations as annual herbaceous life cycles  allowing the flowering plants to fill even more niches   Endosperm In general  endosperm formation begins after fertilization and before the first division of the zygote  Endosperm is a highly nutritive tissue that can provide food for the developing embryo  the cotyledons  and sometimes the seedling when it first appears  These distinguishing characteristics taken together have made the angiosperms the most diverse and numerous land plants and the most commercially important group to humans  The major exception to the dominance of terrestrial ecosystems by flowering plants is the coniferous forest   2  Evolution  Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants  embryophytes  have lived on land for at least 475 million years  Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated  swimming sperm  like the green algae from which they evolved  An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats  This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives  the Charophycean green algae  A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate  avascular sexual stage  the gametophyte  within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte  This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release  as in non seed plants  A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella  the spike moss  The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case  the seed  The first seed bearing plants  like the ginkgo  and conifers  such as pines and firs   did not produce flowers  The pollen grains  males  of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated  mobile sperm cells that  swim  down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs   The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an  abominable mystery  by Charles Darwin  However  the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin  and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus  along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms  suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps  Several groups of extinct gymnosperms  in particular seed ferns  have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants  but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved  Some older fossils  such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia  have been suggested  Based on current evidence  some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms during the late Triassic  245–202 million years ago   Fossil angiosperm like pollen from the Middle Triassic   247 2–242 0 Ma  suggests an older date for their origin  A close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes  proposed on the basis of morphological evidence  has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms   The evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events  These occurred at and   Another possible whole genome duplication event at perhaps created the ancestral line that led to all modern flowering plants  That event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant  Amborella trichopoda  and directly addresses Darwin s  abominable mystery    The earliest known macrofossil confidently identified as an angiosperm  Archaefructus liaoningensis  is dated to about 125 million years BP  the Cretaceous period   whereas pollen considered to be of angiosperm origin takes the fossil record back to about 130 million years BP  However  one study has suggested that the early middle Jurassic plant Schmeissneria  traditionally considered a type of ginkgo  may be the earliest known angiosperm  or at least a close relative  In addition  circumstantial chemical evidence has been found for the existence of angiosperms as early as 250 million years ago  Oleanane  a secondary metabolite produced by many flowering plants  has been found in Permian deposits of that age together with fossils of gigantopterids  Gigantopterids are a group of extinct seed plants that share many morphological traits with flowering plants  although they are not known to have been flowering plants themselves   In 2013 flowers encased in amber were found and dated 100 million years before present  The amber had frozen the act of sexual reproduction in the process of taking place  Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower s stigma  The pollen was sticky  suggesting it was carried by insects   Recent DNA analysis based on molecular systematics showed that Amborella trichopoda  found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia  belongs to a sister group of the other flowering plants  and morphological studies suggest that it has features that may have been characteristic of the earliest flowering plants   The orders Amborellales  Nymphaeales  and Austrobaileyales diverged as separate lineages from the remaining angiosperm clade at a very early stage in flowering plant evolution   The great angiosperm radiation  when a great diversity of angiosperms appears in the fossil record  occurred in the mid Cretaceous  approximately 100 million years ago   However  a study in 2007 estimated that the division of the five most recent  the genus Ceratophyllum  the family Chloranthaceae  the eudicots  the magnoliids  and the monocots  of the eight main groups occurred around 140 million years ago  By the late Cretaceous  angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes  but large canopy forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later  at the beginning of the Tertiary  The radiation of herbaceous angiosperms occurred much later  Yet  many fossil plants recognizable as belonging to modern families  including beech  oak  maple  and magnolia  had already appeared by the late Cretaceous   It is generally assumed that the function of flowers  from the start  was to involve mobile animals in their reproduction processes  That is  pollen can be scattered even if the flower is not brightly colored or oddly shaped in a way that attracts animals  however  by expending the energy required to create such traits  angiosperms can enlist the aid of animals and  thus  reproduce more efficiently   Island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden  fully developed appearance of flowering plants  Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general  especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms  Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain  where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal  a wasp  for example   Such a relationship  with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today  could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant s  and their partners  Note that the wasp example is not incidental  bees  which  it is postulated  evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships  are descended from wasps   Animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds  Fruit  which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts  is frequently a seed dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it  incidentally scattering the seeds it contains  see frugivory   Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely  flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction  spreading  whatever its origin  to become the dominant form of land plant life   Flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots  The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts  often separate from  but in contact with  each other  The flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern  to be bisexual  in plants  this means both male and female parts on the same flower   and to be dominated by the ovary  female part   As flowers evolved  some variations developed parts fused together  with a much more specific number and design  and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least  ovary inferior    Flower evolution continues to the present day  modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be pollinated in nature  Many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds  which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed  Some of them tended to grow with human crops  perhaps already having symbiotic companion plant relationships with them  and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty  developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection   A few paleontologists have also proposed that flowering plants  or angiosperms  might have evolved due to interactions with dinosaurs  One of the idea s strongest proponents is Robert T  Bakker  He proposes that herbivorous dinosaurs  with their eating habits  provided a selective pressure on plants  for which adaptations either succeeded in deterring or coping with predation by herbivores   3  Classification  There are eight groups of living angiosperms   Amborella  a single species of shrub from New Caledonia   Nymphaeales  about 80 species  water lilies and Hydatellaceae   Austrobaileyales  about 100 species of woody plants from various parts of the world   Chloranthales  several dozen species of aromatic plants with toothed leaves   Magnoliids  about 9 000 species  characterized by trimerous flowers  pollen with one pore  and usually branching veined leaves—for example magnolias  bay laurel  and black pepper   Monocots  about 70 000 species  characterized by trimerous flowers  a single cotyledon  pollen with one pore  and usually parallel veined leaves—for example grasses  orchids  and palms   Ceratophyllum  about 6 species of aquatic plants  perhaps most familiar as aquarium plants   Eudicots  about 175 000 species  characterized by 4  or 5 merous flowers  pollen with three pores  and usually branching veined leaves—for example sunflowers  petunia  buttercup  apples  and oaks  The exact relationship between these eight groups is not yet clear  although there is agreement that the first three groups to diverge from the ancestral angiosperm were Amborellales  Nymphaeales  and Austrobaileyales  The term basal angiosperms refers to these three groups  Among the rest  the relationship between the three broadest of these groups  magnoliids  monocots  and eudicots  remains unclear  Some analyses make the magnoliids the first to diverge  others the monocots  Ceratophyllum seems to group with the eudicots rather than with the monocots   3 1  History of classification  The botanical term  Angiosperm   from the Ancient Greek αγγείον  angeíon  bottle  vessel  and σπέρμα   seed   was coined in the form Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690  as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom  This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules  distinguished from his Gymnospermae  or flowering plants with achenial or schizo carpic fruits  the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked  The term and its antonym were maintained by Carolus Linnaeus with the same sense  but with restricted application  in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia  Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827  when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae  and applied to them the name Gymnosperms  From that time onward  as long as these Gymnosperms were  as was usual  reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants  the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers  with varying scope  as a group name for other dicotyledonous plants   In 1851  Hofmeister discovered the changes occurring in the embryo sac of flowering plants  and determined the correct relationships of these to the Cryptogamia  This fixed the position of Gymnosperms as a class distinct from Dicotyledons  and the term Angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than Gymnosperms  including the classes of Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons  This is the sense in which the term is used today   In most taxonomies  the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group  The most popular descriptive name has been Angiospermae  Angiosperms   with Anthophyta   flowering plants   a second choice  These names are not linked to any rank  The Wettstein system and the Engler system use the name Angiospermae  at the assigned rank of subdivision  The Reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision Magnoliophytina  Frohne & U  Jensen ex Reveal  Phytologia 79  70 1996   but later split it to Magnoliopsida  Liliopsida  and Rosopsida  The Takhtajan system and Cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division  leading to the name Magnoliophyta  from the family name Magnoliaceae   The Dahlgren system and Thorne system  1992  treat this group at the rank of class  leading to the name Magnoliopsida  The APG system of 1998  and the later 2003 and 2009 revisions  treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name  However  a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the Subclass Magnoliidae   The internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision  The Cronquist system  proposed by Arthur Cronquist in 1968 and published in its full form in 1981  is still widely used but is no longer believed to accurately reflect phylogeny  A consensus about how the flowering plants should be arranged has recently begun to emerge through the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group  APG   which published an influential reclassification of the angiosperms in 1998  Updates incorporating more recent research were published as APG II in 2003 and as APG III in 2009   Traditionally  the flowering plants are divided into two groups  which in the Cronquist system are called Magnoliopsida  at the rank of class  formed from the family name Magnoliaceae  and Liliopsida  at the rank of class  formed from the family name Liliaceae   Other descriptive names allowed by Article 16 of the ICBN include Dicotyledones or Dicotyledoneae  and Monocotyledones or Monocotyledoneae  which have a long history of use  In English a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon  plural dicotyledons  and monocotyledon  plural monocotyledons   or abbreviated  as dicot  plural dicots  and monocot  plural monocots   These names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two cotyledons  or embryonic leaves  within each seed  The monocots usually have only one  but the rule is not absolute either way  From a diagnostic point of view  the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly handy nor a reliable character   Recent studies  as by the APG  show that the monocots form a monophyletic group  clade  but that the dicots do not  they are paraphyletic   Nevertheless  the majority of dicot species do form a monophyletic group  called the eudicots or tricolpates  Of the remaining dicot species  most belong to a third major clade known as the magnoliids  containing about 9 000 species  The rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms  plus the families Ceratophyllaceae and Chloranthaceae   3 2  Flowering plant diversity  The number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250 000 to 400 000  This compares to around 12 000 species of moss or 11 000 species of pteridophytes  showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse  The number of families in APG  1998  was 462  In APG II  2003  it is not settled  at maximum it is 457  but within this number there are 55 optional segregates  so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402  In APG III  2009  there are 415 families   The diversity of flowering plants is not evenly distributed  Nearly all species belong to the eudicot  75%   monocot  23%   and magnoliid  2%  clades  The remaining 5 clades contain a little over 250 species in total  i e  less than 0 1% of flowering plant diversity  divided among 9 families  The 42 most diverse of 443 families of flowering plants by species  in their APG circumscriptions  are  Asteraceae or Compositae  daisy family   22 750 species   Orchidaceae  orchid

others are eudicot   4  Vascular anatomy  The amount and complexity of tissue formation in flowering plants exceeds that of gymnosperms  The vascular bundles of the stem are arranged such that the xylem and phloem form concentric rings   In the dicotyledons  the bundles in the very young stem are arranged in an open ring  separating a central pith from an outer cortex  In each bundle  separating the xylem and phloem  is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium  By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles  interfascicular cambium   a complete ring is formed  and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside  The soft phloem becomes crushed  but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial  Owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season  the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings  one for each season of growth  called annual rings   Among the monocotyledons  the bundles are more numerous in the young stem and are scattered through the ground tissue  They contain no cambium and once formed the stem increases in diameter only in exceptional cases   5  The flower  fruit  and seed  5 1  Flowers  The characteristic feature of angiosperms is the flower  Flowers show remarkable variation in form and elaboration  and provide the most trustworthy external characteristics for establishing relationships among angiosperm species  The function of the flower is to ensure fertilization of the ovule and development of fruit containing seeds  The floral apparatus may arise terminally on a shoot or from the axil of a leaf  where the petiole attaches to the stem   Occasionally  as in violets  a flower arises singly in the axil of an ordinary foliage leaf  More typically  the flower bearing portion of the plant is sharply distinguished from the foliage bearing or vegetative portion  and forms a more or less elaborate branch system called an inflorescence   There are two kinds of reproductive cells produced by flowers  Microspores  which will divide to become pollen grains  are the  male  cells and are borne in the stamens  or microsporophylls   The  female  cells called megaspores  which will divide to become the egg cell  megagametogenesis   are contained in the ovule and enclosed in the carpel  or megasporophyll    The flower may consist only of these parts  as in willow  where each flower comprises only a few stamens or two carpels  Usually  other structures are present and serve to protect the sporophylls and to form an envelope attractive to pollinators  The individual members of these surrounding structures are known as sepals and petals  or tepals in flowers such as Magnolia where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other   The outer series  calyx of sepals  is usually green and leaf like  and functions to protect the rest of the flower  especially the bud  The inner series  corolla of petals  is  in general  white or brightly colored  and is more delicate in structure  It functions to attract insect or bird pollinators  Attraction is effected by color  scent  and nectar  which may be secreted in some part of the flower  The characteristics that attract pollinators account for the popularity of flowers and flowering plants among humans   While the majority of flowers are perfect or hermaphrodite  having both pollen and ovule producing parts in the same flower structure   flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self fertilization  Heteromorphic flowers have short carpels and long stamens  or vice versa  so animal pollinators cannot easily transfer pollen to the pistil  receptive part of the carpel   Homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical  physiological  mechanism called self incompatibility to discriminate between self and non self pollen grains  In other species  the male and female parts are morphologically separated  developing on different flowers   5 2  Fertilization and embryogenesis  Double fertilization refers to a process in which two sperm cells fertilize cells in the ovary  This process begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the pistil  female reproductive structure   germinates  and grows a long pollen tube  While this pollen tube is growing  a haploid generative cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus  The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid  n  sperm cells  As the pollen tube grows  it makes its way from the stigma  down the style and into the ovary  Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into one of the synergids  releasing its contents  which include the sperm cells   The synergid that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell  producing a diploid  2n  zygote  The second sperm cell fuses with both central cell nuclei  producing a triploid  3n  cell  As the zygote develops into an embryo  the triploid cell develops into the endosperm  which serves as the embryo s food supply  The ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed   5 3  Fruit and seed  As the development of embryo and endosperm proceeds within the embryo sac  the sac wall enlarges and combines with the nucellus  which is likewise enlarging  and the integument to form the seed coat  The ovary wall develops to form the fruit or pericarp  whose form is closely associated with the manner of distribution of the seed   Frequently  the influence of fertilization is felt beyond the ovary  and other parts of the flower take part in the formation of the fruit  e g   the floral receptacle in the apple  strawberry  and others   The character of the seed coat bears a definite relation to that of the fruit  They protect the embryo and aid in dissemination  they may also directly promote germination  Among plants with indehiscent fruits  in general  the fruit provides protection for the embryo and secures dissemination  In this case  the seed coat is only slightly developed  If the fruit is dehiscent and the seed is exposed  in general  the seed coat is well developed  and must discharge the functions otherwise executed by the fruit   6  Economic importance  Agriculture is almost entirely dependent on angiosperms  which provide virtually all plant based food  and also provide a significant amount of livestock feed  Of all the families of plants  the Poaceae  or grass family  grains   is by far the most important  providing the bulk of all feedstocks  rice  corn — maize  wheat  barley  rye  oats  pearl millet  sugar cane  sorghum   The Fabaceae  or legume family  comes in second place  Also of high importance are the Solanaceae  or nightshade family  potatoes  tomatoes  and peppers  among others   the Cucurbitaceae  or gourd family  also including pumpkins and melons   the Brassicaceae  or mustard plant family  including rapeseed and the innumerable varieties of the cabbage species Brassica oleracea   and the Apiaceae  or parsley family  Many of our fruits come from the Rutaceae  or rue family  including oranges  lemons  grapefruits  etc    and the Rosaceae  or rose family  including apples  pears  cherries  apricots  plums  etc     In some parts of the world  certain single species assume paramount importance because of their variety of uses  for example the coconut  Cocos nucifera  on Pacific atolls  and the olive  Olea europaea  in the Mediterranean region   Flowering plants also provide economic resources in the form of wood  paper  fiber  cotton  flax  and hemp  among others   medicines  digitalis  camphor   decorative and landscaping plants  and many other uses  The main area in which they are surpassed by other plants — namely  coniferous trees  Pinales   which are non flowering  gymnosperms  — is timber and paper production   7  See also  List of garden plants  List of plant orders  List of plants by common name
