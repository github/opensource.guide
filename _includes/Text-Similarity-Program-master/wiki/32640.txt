Vector calculus  or vector analysis  is a branch of mathematics concerned with differentiation and integration of vector fields  primarily in 3 dimensional Euclidean space The term  vector calculus  is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus  which includes vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration  Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations  It is used extensively in physics and engineering  especially in the description of electromagnetic fields  gravitational fields and fluid flow   Vector calculus was developed from quaternion analysis by J  Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside near the end of the 19th century  and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and Edwin Bidwell Wilson in their 1901 book  Vector Analysis  In the conventional form using cross products  vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions  while the alternative approach of geometric algebra  which uses exterior products does generalize  as discussed below   1  Basic objects  1 1  Scalar fields  A scalar field associates a scalar value to every point in a space  The scalar may either be a mathematical number or a physical quantity Examples of scalar fields in applications include the temperature distribution throughout space  the pressure distribution in a fluid  and spin zero quantum fields  such as the Higgs field  These fields are the subject of scalar field theory   1 2  Vector fields  A vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of space  A vector field in the plane  for instance  can be visualized as a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction each attached to a point in the plane  Vector fields are often used to model  for example  the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space  or the strength and direction of some force  such as the magnetic or gravitational force  as it changes from point to point   1 3  Vectors and pseudovectors  In more advanced treatments  one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields  which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields except that they change sign under an orientation reversing map  for example  the curl of a vector field is a pseudovector field  and if one reflects a vector field  the curl points in the opposite direction  This distinction is clarified and elaborated in geometric algebra  as described below   2  Vector operations  2 1  Algebraic operations  The basic algebraic  non differential  operations in vector calculus are referred to as vector algebra  being defined for a vector space and then globally applied to a vector field  and consist of   scalar multiplication  multiplication of a scalar field and a vector field  yielding a vector field     vector addition  addition of two vector fields  yielding a vector field     dot product  multiplication of two vector fields  yielding a scalar field     cross product  multiplication of two vector fields  yielding a vector field     There are also two triple products   scalar triple product  the dot product of a vector and a cross product of two vectors     vector triple product  the cross product of a vector and a cross product of two vectors  or   although these are less often used as basic operations  as they can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products   2 2  Differential operations  Vector calculus studies various differential operators defined on scalar or vector fields  which are typically expressed in terms of the del operator     also known as  nabla   The five most important differential operations in vector calculus are   where the curl and divergence differ because the former uses a cross product and the latter a dot product  denotes a scalar field and denotes a vector field  A quantity called the Jacobian is useful for studying functions when both the domain and range of the function are multivariable  such as a change of variables during integration   3  Theorems  Likewise  there are several important theorems related to these operators which generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions   4  Applications  4 1  Linear approximations  Linear approximations are used to replace complicated functions with linear functions that are almost the same  Given a differentiable function with real values  one can approximate for close to by the formula  The right hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of at  4 2  Optimization  For a continuously differentiable function of several real variables  a point P  that is a set of values for the input variables  which is viewed as a point in Rn  is critical if all of the partial derivatives of the function are zero at P  or  equivalently  if its gradient is zero  The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points   If the function is smooth  or  at least twice continuously differentiable  a critical point may be either a local maximum  a local minimum or a saddle point  The different cases may be distinguished by considering the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives   By Fermat s theorem  all local maxima and minima of a differentiable function occur at critical points  Therefore  to find the local maxima and minima  it suffices  theoretically  to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros   4 3  Physics and engineering  Vector calculus is particularly useful in studying   Center of mass  Field theory  Kinematics  5  Generalizations  5 1  Different 3 manifolds  Vector calculus is initially defined for Euclidean 3 space  which has additional structure beyond simply being a 3 dimensional real vector space  namely  an inner product  the dot product   which gives a notion of length  and hence angle   and an orientation  which gives a notion of left handed and right handed  These structures give rise to a volume form  and also the cross product  which is used pervasively in vector calculus   The gradient and divergence require only the inner product  while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness of the coordinate system to be taken into account  see cross product and handedness for more detail    Vector calculus can be defined on other 3 dimensional real vector spaces if they have an inner product  or more generally a symmetric nondegenerate form  and an orientation  note that this is less data than an isomorphism to Euclidean space  as it does not require a set of coordinates  a frame of reference   which reflects the fact that vector calculus is invariant under rotations  the special orthogonal group SO 3     More generally  vector calculus can be defined on any 3 dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold  or more generally pseudo Riemannian manifold  This structure simply means that the tangent space at each point has an inner product  more generally  a symmetric nondegenerate form  and an orientation  or more globally that there is a symmetric nondegenerate metric tensor and an orientation  and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point   5 2  Other dimensions  Most of the analytic results are easily understood  in a more general form  using the machinery of differential geometry  of which vector calculus forms a subset  Grad and div generalize immediately to other dimensions  as do the gradient theorem  divergence theorem  and Laplacian  yielding harmonic analysis   while curl and cross product do not generalize as directly   From a general point of view  the various fields in  3 dimensional  vector calculus are uniformly seen as being k vector fields  scalar fields are 0 vector fields  vector fields are 1 vector fields  pseudovector fields are 2 vector fields  and pseudoscalar fields are 3 vector fields  In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields  scalar vector pseudovector pseudoscalar corresponding to 0 1 n蜢1 n dimensions  which is exhaustive in dimension 3   so one cannot only work with  pseudo scalars and  pseudo vectors   In any dimension  assuming a nondegenerate form  grad of a scalar function is a vector field  and div of a vector field is a scalar function  but only in dimension 3 and 7  and  trivially  dimension 0  is the curl of a vector field a vector field  and only in 3 or 7 dimensions can a cross product be defined  generalizations in other dimensionalities either require vectors to yield 1 vector  or are alternative Lie algebras  which are more general antisymmetric bilinear products   The generalization of grad and div  and how curl may be generalized is elaborated at Curl  Generalizations  in brief  the curl of a vector field is a bivector field  which may be interpreted as the special orthogonal Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations  however  this cannot be identified with a vector field because the dimensions differ   there are 3 dimensions of rotations in 3 dimensions  but 6 dimensions of rotations in 4 dimensions  and more generally dimensions of rotations in n dimensions    There are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus  The first  geometric algebra  uses k vector fields instead of vector fields  in 3 or fewer dimensions  every k vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field  but this is not true in higher dimensions   This replaces the cross product  which is specific to 3 dimensions  taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field  with the exterior product  which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields  giving as output a bivector  2 vector  field  This product yields Clifford algebras as the algebraic structure on vector spaces  with an orientation and nondegenerate form   Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions   The second generalization uses differential forms  k covector fields  instead of vector fields or k vector fields  and is widely used in mathematics  particularly in differential geometry  geometric topology  and harmonic analysis  in particular yielding Hodge theory on oriented pseudo Riemannian manifolds  From this point of view  grad  curl  and div correspond to the exterior derivative of 0 forms  1 forms  and 2 forms  respectively  and the key theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the general form of Stokes  theorem   From the point of view of both of these generalizations  vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct objects  which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less clear  From the point of view of geometric algebra  vector calculus implicitly identifies k vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions  0 vectors and 3 vectors with scalars  1 vectors and 2 vectors with vectors  From the point of view of differential forms  vector calculus implicitly identifies k forms with scalar fields or vector fields  0 forms and 3 forms with scalar fields  1 forms and 2 forms with vector fields  Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field  but naturally has as output a 2 vector field or 2 form  hence pseudovector field   which is then interpreted as a vector field  rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field  this is reflected in the curl of a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field   6  See also  Real valued function  Function of a real variable  Real multivariable function  Vector calculus identities  Del in cylindrical
