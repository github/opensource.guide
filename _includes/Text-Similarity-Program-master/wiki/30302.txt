The TARDIS    Time and Relative Dimension in Space  is a time machine and spacecraft in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who and its associated spin offs The Sarah Jane Adventures  Torchwood and more   A TARDIS is a product of the advanced technology of the Time Lords  an extraterrestrial civilisation to which the programme s central character  the Doctor  belongs  A properly maintained and piloted TARDIS can transport its occupants to any point in time and any place in the universe  The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior  which can blend in with its surroundings using the ship s  chameleon circuit   TARDISes also possess a degree of sentience  which has been expressed in a variety of ways ranging from implied machine personality and free will through to the use of a conversant avatar  and provide their users with additional tools and abilities including a telepathically based universal translation system   In the series  the Doctor pilots an apparently unreliable  obsolete Type 40  Mark 1 TARDIS  Its chameleon circuit is broken  leaving it stuck in the shape of a 1960s style London police box after a visit to London in 1963  The Doctor s TARDIS was for most of the series  history said to have been stolen from the Time Lords  home planet  Gallifrey  where it was old  decommissioned and derelict  However  during the events of  The Doctor s Wife   2011   the ship s consciousness briefly inhabits a human body named Idris  and she reveals that far from being stolen  she left of her own free will  During this episode  she flirtatiously implies that she  stole  the Doctor rather than the other way around  although she does also refer to him as her  thief  in the same episode   The unpredictability of the TARDIS s short range guidance  relative to the size of the Universe  has often been a plot point in the Doctor s travels  Also in  The Doctor s Wife   the TARDIS reveals that much of this  unpredictability  was actually intentional on its part in order to get the Doctor  where  he  needed to go  as opposed to where he  wanted to go    Although  TARDIS  is a type of craft rather than a specific one  the Doctor s TARDIS is usually referred to as  the  TARDIS or  in some of the earlier serials  just as  the ship    the blue box    the capsule  or  the police box    Doctor Who has become so much a part of British popular culture that not only has the shape of the police box become more immediately associated with the TARDIS than with its real world inspiration  the term  TARDIS like  has been used to describe anything that seems to be bigger on the inside than on the outside  The name TARDIS is a registered trademark of the British Broadcasting Corporation   1  Conceptual history  When Doctor Who was being developed in 1963  the production staff discussed what the Doctor s time machine would look like  To keep the design within budget  it was decided to make it resemble a police telephone box  This was explained in the context of the series as a disguise created by the ship s  chameleon circuit   a mechanism which is responsible for changing the outside appearance of the ship the millisecond it lands in order to fit in with its environment  The Ninth Doctor explains that if  for example  a TARDIS  with a working chameleon circuit  were to materialise in ancient Rome it might disguise itself as a statue on a plinth  The First Doctor explained that if it were to land in the middle of the Indian Mutiny  it might take on the appearance of a howdah  the carrier on the back of an elephant   A further premise was that the circuit was broken  explaining why it was  stuck  in that form   The idea for the police box disguise came from BBC staff writer Anthony Coburn  who rewrote the programme s first episode from a draft by C  E  Webber  In the first episode   An Unearthly Child   the TARDIS is first seen in a 1963 junkyard  It subsequently malfunctions  retaining the police box shape in a prehistoric landscape   At the time of the series  debut in 1963  the police box was still a common fixture in British cities  It provided a direct telephone link to the local police station  the telephone was located behind a small  hinged door  making it possible to use it from the outside  while the box itself was used as a temporary office containing a desk  In  The Empty Child   2005   the Doctor stated that the telephone is not connected to a telephone line  and in Logopolis  1981   the Master materialised his TARDIS around a normal police box while a police officer was using the telephone  causing the line to go dead  However  in  The Day of the Doctor   the Doctor successfully used the telephone   The first police box prop to be built for the programme was designed by Peter Brachacki  who worked as designer on the first episode  Nevertheless  one story has it the box came from Z Cars  while Doctor Who producer Steven Moffat has said that the original TARDIS prop was reused from Dixon of Dock Green  although this is explicitly contradicted by the research cited on the BBC s own website  Despite changes in the prop  the TARDIS has become the show s most consistently recognisable visual element   The dimensions and colour of the TARDIS props used in the series have changed many times  as a result of damage and the needs of the show  and none of the BBC props has been a faithful replica of the original MacKenzie Trench model  This was referenced on screen in the episode  Blink   2007   when the character Detective Inspector Shipton says the TARDIS  isn t a real  police box   The phone s just a dummy  and the windows are the wrong size    The production team conceived of the TARDIS travelling by dematerialising at one point and rematerialising elsewhere  although sometimes in the series it is shown also to be capable of conventional space travel  In the 2006 Christmas special   The Runaway Bride   the Doctor remarks that for a spaceship  the TARDIS does remarkably little flying  The ability to travel simply by fading into and out of different locations became one of the trademarks of the show  allowing for a great deal of versatility in setting and storytelling without a large expense in special effects  The distinctive accompanying sound effect – a cyclic wheezing  groaning noise – was originally created in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop by Brian Hodgson  He produced the effect by dragging a set of house keys along the strings of an old  gutted piano  The resulting sound was recorded and electronically processed with echo and reverb  When employed in the series  the sound is usually synchronised with the flashing light on top of the police box  or the fade in and fade out effects of a TARDIS  see  Controls  below   The comic strip feature of Doctor Who Magazine traditionally represents the ship s distinctive dematerialisation sound with the onomatopoeic phrase  vworp vworp vworp   The sound itself was heard during a segment of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London as rock band Queen s Bohemian Rhapsody was played to the stadium   In 1996  the BBC applied to the UK Patent Office to register the TARDIS as a trademark  This was challenged by the Metropolitan Police  who felt that they owned the rights to the police box image  However  the Patent Office found that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police – or any other police force – had ever registered the image as a trademark  In addition  the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police  The Patent Office issued a ruling in favour of the BBC in 2002   2  General characteristics  TARDISes are bioships that are grown from a species of coral presumably indigenous to Gallifrey  as stated in  The Impossible Planet   2006   and it can take years to complete one  They draw their power from several sources  but primarily from the Eye of Harmony  an exploding star in the process of becoming a black hole suspended in a permanent state of decay  In The Edge of Destruction  1964   the power source of the TARDIS  referred to as the  heart of the TARDIS   is said to be beneath the central column of the console  They are also said to draw power from the entire universe as revealed in the episode  Rise of the Cybermen   2006   in which the TARDIS is brought to a parallel universe and cannot function without the use of a crystal power source from within the TARDIS  charged by the Doctor s life force   Other elements needed for the proper functioning of the TARDIS and requiring occasional replenishment include mercury  used in its fluid links   the rare ore Zeiton 7  Vengeance on Varos  1985   a trachoid time crystal  The Hand of Fear  1976  and  artron energy   Artron energy is said to be the  residue of TARDIS engines   and is also found in Time Lord brains and bodies of other time travellers  The Deadly Assassin  1976  Four to Doomsday  1982  The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith  2009  Death of the Doctor  2010   The Doctor s Wife   2011   The Power of Three   2012   Another form of energy   huon energy   is found in the heart of the TARDIS and  apart from the activities of the Torchwood Institute  nowhere else in the universe   The Runaway Bride     Before a TARDIS becomes fully functional  it must be primed with the biological imprint of a Time Lord  normally done by simply having a Time Lord operate the TARDIS for the first time  This imprint comes from the Rassilon Imprimatur  part of the biological make up of Time Lords  which gives them both a symbiotic link to their TARDISes and the ability to withstand the physical stresses of time travel  The Two Doctors  1985   Without the Imprimatur  molecular disintegration would result  this serves as a safeguard against misuse of time travel even if the TARDIS technology were copied  Once a time machine is properly primed  however  with the imprint stored on a device called a  briode nebuliser   it can be used safely by any species  According to Time Lord law  unauthorised use of a TARDIS carries  only one penalty   implied to be death   The Invasion of Time     A TARDIS usually travels by dematerialising in one spot  traversing the time vortex  and then rematerialising at its destination  without physically travelling through the intervening space  However  the Doctor s TARDIS has been seen to be able to fly through physical space  first in Fury from the Deep  1968  and at repeated times throughout the revived series  most notably in  The Runaway Bride   2006   in which the TARDIS is shown launching into space  most previous incidents show the TARDIS flying only after it has dematerialised from a location   In  The Runaway Bride   extended flight of this nature puts a strain on the TARDIS s systems  While a TARDIS can materialise inside another  if both TARDISes occupy exactly the same space and time  a Time Ram will occur  resulting in their mutual annihilation  The Time Monster   In Logopolis  the Master tricked the Doctor into materialising his TARDIS around the Master s  creating a dimensionally recursive loop  each TARDIS appearing inside the other s console room  In the mini episodes  Space  and  Time   2011   an accident results in the TARDIS automatically materialising in  the safest spot available   which turns out to be inside its own control room   Apart from the ability to travel in space and time  and  on occasion  to other dimensions   the most remarkable characteristic of a TARDIS is that its interior is much larger than it appears from the outside  The explanation is that a TARDIS is  dimensionally transcendental   meaning that its exterior and interior exist in separate dimensions  In The Robots of Death  1977   the Fourth Doctor tried to explain this to his companion Leela  using the analogy of how a larger cube can appear to be able to fit inside a smaller one if the larger cube is farther away  yet immediately accessible at the same time  see Tesseract   According to the Doctor  transdimensional engineering was  a key Time Lord discovery   To those unfamiliar with this aspect of a TARDIS  stepping inside the ship for the first time usually results in a reaction of shocked disbelief as they see the interior dimensions   It s bigger on the inside     The Eleventh Doctor is particularly fond of this reaction  and is surprised and confused when Clara Oswald  in  The Snowmen   inverts the usual response by saying  It s smaller on the outside    Susan Foreman  the Doctor s granddaughter  claimed to have coined the acronym TARDIS   I made  it  up from the initials   The word TARDIS is used to describe other Time Lords  travel capsules as well  The Discontinuity Guide  written by Paul Cornell  Keith Topping  and Martin Day  suggests that   she  was a precocious young Time Lady  and her name for travel capsules caught on   The Virgin New Adventures novel Lungbarrow by Marc Platt records Susan telling the First Doctor that she gave him the idea when he was  implicitly  the  Other    As seen in The Trial of a Time Lord  1986   the experiences of the TARDIS and its crew can be recorded and played back from the Matrix  the Time Lord computer network that is the repository of all their knowledge  as well as the memories and experiences of deceased Time Lords  The Doctor implies in this serial  with his protestations of being  bugged   that the TARDIS is not normally connected to the Matrix in this manner   The TARDIS has been shown to be incredibly rugged  withstanding gunfire  the 1996 television movie  Doctor Who   The Runaway Bride    temperatures of 3000 degrees without even scorching   42    atmospheric re entry   Voyage of the Damned    falls of several miles   The Satan Pit   and sinking into pooling acid   The Almost People    In The Curse of Peladon  after the TARDIS falls down the side of a cliff  the Third Doctor remarks that it  may have its faults  but it is indestructible   This does not apply when facing certain extremely advanced weaponry  often created after the Doctor s Type 40 TARDIS  such as Dalek missiles   The Parting of the Ways    for which the TARDIS requires additional shielding  Another piece of advanced Dalek technology which comes near to destroying the TARDIS is the power source of the  Crucible  in  Journey s End   2008   In Frontios  1984   the Fifth Doctor believes the TARDIS to have been destroyed in a meteorite bombardment  apparently contradicting the earlier claim of indestructibility  It explodes in The Mind Robber  1968  and the crew end up  out of the time space dimension  Out of reality   In 2007 s Christmas special  Voyage of the Damned   the TARDIS is hit in mid flight  creating a large hole in the interior wall  although its shields are down at the time  The Doctor later activates some controls and the TARDIS again becomes able to withstand an atmospheric re entry  Also in the 2013 episode  The Name of the Doctor  the TARDIS is shown to be able to withstand immense speeds  pressure and heat by being pulled into Trenzalore s atmosphere without any functioning systems  The only noticeable damage caused was to the exterior of the TARDIS  in which a small crack is shown on the glass  In  Robot of Sherwood   Robin Hood s wooden arrow easily pierces the TARDIS s wooden frame  However  once the Twelfth Doctor removes it  the hole immediately seals itself   3  The Doctor s TARDIS  In the programme  the Doctor s TARDIS is an obsolete  Type 40 TT capsule  that he unofficially  borrowed  from the repair shop when he departed his home planet of Gallifrey  That incident was referred to as early as 1969  but not shown on screen for another 44 years  in a scene where future companion Clara Oswald advised him the specific capsule to take  although the navigation systems were malfunctioning it would be much more fun   The TARDIS was already old when the Doctor first took it  but its actual age is not specified  In the unfinished TV serial Shada  fellow Time Lord Professor Chronotis said that the Type 40 models came out when he was a boy  There were originally 305 registered Type 40s  but all the others had been decommissioned and replaced by new  improved models  According to the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Gallifrey Chronicles by Lance Parkin  the Doctor s TARDIS previously belonged to a Time Lord named Marnal  who was  like the Doctor  something of a renegade  The spin off media have  on a number of occasions  had the TARDIS wait around for the Doctor for decades and even centuries in relative time  By the time of The Pirate Planet  the Doctor had been travelling on board in time and space for 523 years  by the time of  The Doctor s Wife   he had been travelling in it for 700 years  and in  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS  he had been travelling for 900 years  In  The Empty Child   2005   the Ninth Doctor claimed that he has had  900 years of phone box travel    The appearance of the primary console room has changed over the years  sometimes in minor ways and sometimes drastically when the set has had to be moved or rebuilt  This has often been rationalised in the scripts as redecoration  the ship s own ability to reconfigure or repair itself  or even a change of  desktop theme   In  The Doctor s Wife  the TARDIS says she has thirty desktops archived  although the Doctor has only changed it a dozen times  yet    In the 2011 episode  The Doctor s Wife  the  soul  of the ship is transferred into the body of a humanoid female called Idris  enabling the Doctor to have a conversation with his craft  The TARDIS says that she deliberately allowed the Doctor to  steal  her  as she wanted to see the universe itself  in a reversal of the traditional view  the TARDIS claims to have stolen the Doctor  When he accuses the TARDIS of being unreliable  she defends herself by saying that she has always taken him where he  needed to go   as opposed to where he  wanted to go   During their brief opportunity to converse  the TARDIS expresses both affection and frustration with the Doctor  including annoyance that he pushes her doors open rather than pulls them open as the instructional sign on the outside indicates   When asked by the Doctor if she actually has a name  she self identifies with the name  Sexy   based upon what the Doctor calls her when he s alone in the ship  she later introduces herself to the Doctor s companions using this name   Eventually  the Idris  avatar  dies  and the last words uttered by the TARDIS to the Doctor using this interface are  I love you   Two additional pieces of information confirmed by the TARDIS during this incident are that TARDIS consciousnesses are female and that she and the Doctor have been travelling for approximately 700 years   In a later episode   Let s Kill Hitler   2011   the Doctor speaks to the TARDIS by way of a holographic voice interface  In this instance  after providing options including an image of himself and former companions  the TARDIS manifests as an image of Amelia Pond as a child  In  Hide   2013   companion Clara Oswald interacts with a similar interface outside the TARDIS  doors when it refuses to open for her  In a subsequent mini episode entitled  Clara and the TARDIS   further animosity between Clara and the ship s consciousness is indicated when the TARDIS reconfigures her internal layout to prevent Clara from finding her bedroom  However  following  The Name of the Doctor    in which her leap into the Doctor s time stream is what facilitated the Doctor and Susan to steal that TARDIS instead of the adjacent one that they had intended to take   the TARDIS s animosity appears to have disappeared as Clara is now shown as able to close the TARDIS doors with a click of her fingers   The episode  Hide  revealed that the Doctor s TARDIS is capable of operating autonomously  in the storyline  Clara convinces the ship  simply by speaking to her  to enter a pocket universe to rescue the imperiled Doctor   3 1  Exterior  The undisguised appearance of a Type 40 TARDIS  exterior is a silver grey cylinder only slightly larger than a police box  Its door is recessed and slides to open  This default state has appeared only in 2013 s  The Name of the Doctor   which depicts the TARDIS s original theft by the Doctor  Although a TARDIS is supposed to blend inconspicuously into whatever environment it turns up in  the Doctor s TARDIS retains the shape of a police box because of a fault that occurred in the first Doctor Who serial  An Unearthly Child  The ability to alter its appearance was first mentioned in the second episode of the series  where the First Doctor and Susan noted the unit was malfunctioning    It s still a police box  Why hasn t it changed    It was first given a general term of a  camouflage unit  in The Time Meddler  1965   The name  chameleon circuit  was first used in the 1975 Target Books novelisation of The Terror of the Autons  and eventually mentioned on screen in Logopolis  1981   The circuit was called a  cloaking device  by the Eighth Doctor in the Doctor Who television movie  and again a  chameleon circuit  in the 2005 series episode  Boom Town    The Doctor attempts to repair the circuit in Logopolis  to disastrous results  He tries again in Attack of the Cybermen  but the successful transformations of the TARDIS into the shape of a pipe organ  a painted Welsh dresser  much to the amusement of Perpurgilliam  Peri  Brown and the Sixth Doctor s annoyance  and an elaborate gateway ended with a return to the police box shape  The circuit was also repaired during the Virgin New Adventures novels  but again the TARDIS s shape was eventually restored to a police box shape  In  Boom Town   2005   the Ninth Doctor implied that he had stopped trying to fix the circuit quite some time ago because he had become rather fond of the police box shape – a claim the Eighth Doctor made in the 1996 television movie   Cosmetically  the police box exterior of the TARDIS has remained virtually unchanged  although there have been slight modifications over the years  For example  the sign on the door concealing the police telephone has been black letters on a white background  An Unearthly Child   white on blue  The Seeds of Death  and white on black  The Curse of Peladon   Other modifications include different wordings on the phone panel  for example   Urgent Calls   An Unearthly Child  as opposed to  All Calls   Castrovalva publicity photos   The  POLICE BOX  sign was wider from Season 18  1980  onwards and for the 2005 series  but not for the television movie  From An Unearthly Child  1963  to The War Machines  1966   the TARDIS also had a St  John Ambulance badge on the main doors  as did real police boxes  this has been reinstated and the window frame colour has returned to white for Matt Smith s first season as the Doctor  shown in 2010   The Empty Child  showed that the telephone cupboard could be opened and the telephone accessed from the exterior  but this device was then non functional  The telephone can however be called from across space and time  Because of the St  John Ambulance badge  11th century monks considered the telephone s ring to be  the bells of Saint John    Despite the anachronistic police box shape  the TARDIS s presence is rarely questioned when it materialises in the present day United Kingdom  In  Boom Town   the Doctor simply noted that humans do not notice odd things like the TARDIS  echoing a similar sentiment expressed by the Seventh Doctor in Remembrance of the Daleks  1988   that humans have an  amazing capacity for self deception   while in The Fires of Pompeii it is mistaken for an objet d art by a merchant  played by future Doctor Peter Capaldi   who purchases it and moves it into his home  Various episodes  notably  The Sound of Drums   also note that the TARDIS generates a perception filter to reinforce the idea that it is perfectly ordinary   When the TARDIS  died  with the Doctor in battle in an alternate timeline  it became his tomb on the grave fields of the planet Trenzalore  Although the tomb retains its police box exterior appearance  its interior volume begins to  leak   growing the exterior to hundreds of feet in height   3 1 1  Doors and lock  For most of the series  run  the exterior doors of the police box operated separately from the heavier interior doors  although sometimes the two sets could open simultaneously to allow the ship s passengers to look directly outside and vice versa  The revived series  TARDIS features no such secondary doors  the police box doors open directly into the console room  The entrance to the TARDIS is capable of being locked and unlocked from the outside with a key  which the Doctor keeps on his person and occasionally gives copies of to his companions  In the 1996 television movie  the Doctor kept a spare key  in a cubbyhole behind the  P    of the POLICE BOX sign   In The Invasion of Time  a Citadel Guard on Gallifrey is initially baffled by the archaic lock when attempting to open the Doctor s TARDIS   The Doctor almost always opens the doors inwards  despite the fact that a real police box door opened outwards  in  The Doctor s Wife   it is revealed that the TARDIS is aware of this and finds it annoying  After crash landing on its back in Amelia Pond s garden in  The Eleventh Hour   the doors uncharacteristically open outward  as they had previously done when the TARDIS was also on its back in The Ice Warriors  additionally  the left door opened in tandem with the usual right door in these instances  When hovering against a building in the same  doors up  horizontal orientation in  Day of the Moon   however  the doors opened inward as usual to receive River Song   In the 2005 series  the keys are also remotely linked to the TARDIS  capable of signalling its presence or impending arrival by heating up and glowing  The TARDIS keys have varied in design from an ordinary Yale key to an ankh like key embossed with an alien pattern  identified in Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke s 1972 book The Making of Doctor Who as the constellation of Kasterborous  Gallifrey s home system  from seasons 11 to 13  after which it reverted to the Yale key design  The ankh like key was also used in the 1996 television movie  In Ghost Light and Survival  a different design  featuring the Seal of Rassilon  was used  The revived series uses the Yale key version  most notably shown in  Blink   2007   when the Weeping Angels attempt to gain access to the TARDIS using a stolen key   The key is also able to repair temporal anomalies and paradoxes  including death aversion  through its link to the TARDIS   The TARDIS lock s security level has varied from story to story  Originally  it was said to have 21 different  combinations  and would melt if the key was placed in the wrong one  The Daleks  1963   The First Doctor was also able to unlock it with his ring  The Web Planet  1965  and repair it by using the light of an alien sun refracted through the ring s jewel  The Daleks  Master Plan   In The Dalek Invasion of Earth  1964  and  Utopia   2007   the TARDIS was shown to have an internal deadlock  once thrown  it would prevent entry even for authorised users with authorised keys  In The Dalek Invasion of Earth  this was known as  double locking   In The Sensorites  1964   the entire lock mechanism was removed from the TARDIS door via a hand held Sensorite device   The lock itself has been shown with different capabilities  In Spearhead from Space  1970   the Third Doctor said that the lock had a metabolism detector  so that even if an unauthorised person had a key  the doors would remain locked  This security measure was also seen in the New Series Adventures novel Only Human by Gareth Roberts  which called it an  advanced meson recognition system   The Ninth Doctor claimed that when the doors were shut  even  the assembled hordes of Genghis Khan  could not enter   believe me  they ve tried     Rose    In  Doomsday   when the TARDIS is confiscated  the Doctor claims   You ll never get inside it   Several people have managed to just wander into the TARDIS without any problem over the years  including some who became companions  since the TARDIS uses keys  it could easily have been left unlocked  Despite the TARDIS s apparent infallibility in its security  some of the instruments inside or the interior itself have been breached and remote controlled  In the serial The War Games  the Time Lords manage to breach the inside of the TARDIS while in mid flight and landing in order to erect something similar to a force field  In  Utopia   the Doctor is able to lock the TARDIS to the coordinates it had previously visited from outside using the sonic screwdriver  In the episode  The Rings of Akhaten   Clara Oswald cannot get into the TARDIS and says   I don t think it likes me    In the 2008 episode  Forest of the Dead   River Song  a character whose timeline intersects with the Doctor s in non linear order  says to the Doctor that she knows he would be able to open the TARDIS doors with a snap of his fingers  Although the Doctor dismisses this as impossible  at the conclusion of the episode  he opens and closes the doors by doing just that  eschewing the need for a key  He is later shown doing the same in  The Eleventh Hour  and  Day of the Moon   and  in  The Day of the Doctor   2013   despite the previous animosity the TARDIS displayed towards her  Clara Oswald is also shown as able to shut the doors with a snap of her fingers   In the 2009 Christmas episode  part one of The End of Time  the Doctor uses a remote locking system to lock the TARDIS  similar to the remote control locking system used on modern cars  Upon pointing his key fob at the TARDIS  the TARDIS makes a distinctive chirp and the light on top of the TARDIS flashes  Later in the same episode  the key fob  when again used by the Doctor  shifts the TARDIS  just a second out of sync   one second into the future   rendering it invisible and so hiding it from the Master   The doors are supposed to be closed while materialising  in Planet of Giants  1964   the opening of the doors during a materialisation sequence caused the ship and its occupants to shrink to doll size  In The Enemy of the World  1967   taking off while the doors were still open results in an uncontrolled decompression  causing the villainous Salamander to be blown out of the TARDIS  In Warriors  Gate  1981   the doors open during flight between two universes  admitting a Tharil named Biroc  and allowing the time winds to burn the Doctor s hand and seriously damage K 9  In  The Runaway Bride   2006    The Stolen Earth   2008  and subsequent stories  the doors can be opened safely while the ship is in a vacuum  as the TARDIS protects its occupants  see the  Defences  section below   in The Horns of Nimon  1979   the Doctor deliberately extrudes the  defence shield  to dock with a spacecraft   There is evidence that objects clinging to the outside of the TARDIS may be carried with it as it dematerialises  In Silver Nemesis  1988   an arrow is fired at the TARDIS and is embedded in its door  The arrow remains in the door throughout the serial and through several dematerialisations before being removed at the story s conclusion  this is repeated in  The Shakespeare Code   2007   and the arrow is removed in the following episode   Gridlock    Utopia  presents  for the first time on screen  a circumstance in which a character travels on the exterior of the TARDIS during a flight  when Jack Harkness grabs hold of the TARDIS as it began to dematerialise and hold on until it reaches its destination  the episode does establish  however  that a normal person would not have survived the trip  as Jack is  killed  by the experience  but due to his immortality  soon revives  This concept was altered for The Time of the Doctor where Clara also travels with the TARDIS by holding on to its exterior  To prevent Clara from dying the TARDIS has to drastically slow down its time travel  arriving 300 years too late with a visibly aged Doctor shouting where has it been all this time  In  Vincent and the Doctor   2010   some advertisements are attached to the TARDIS  After materialisation  they are shown to be burning   In the Seventh Doctor audio drama Colditz  a character was killed by being halfway inside the TARDIS when it dematerialised   3 1 2  Exterior influence  The Time Lords are able to divert the TARDIS s flight path  The Ribos Operation  1978    or have the ability to totally override and recall any TARDIS by the order of the Council  Arc of Infinity  1983    Alien influences have also  for example  trapped the Doctor s TARDIS and drained its power in The Web Planet  1965  and Death to the Daleks  1974   while its course has been diverted by The Keeper of Traken  1981   the Mandragora Helix  1976  and by the Daleks   time corridor  in Resurrection of the Daleks  1984   In The Mark of the Rani  1985   the Rani used a Stattenheim remote control to summon her TARDIS  In The Two Doctors  1985   the Second Doctor also used a portable Stattenheim  The Doctor used his sonic screwdriver to trigger remotely  Emergency Programme One   sending his human companion Rose Tyler to safety  while he stayed behind for a battle against the Daleks  The Parting of the Ways  2005    The Doctor also manipulated the TARDIS by utilising the self attracting nature of huon particles  causing the TARDIS to materialise around both Donna Noble and himself  in order to escape into the past  However  this trick was used in turn by the Empress of the Racnoss  which pulled the TARDIS from the creation of the Earth to only a few minutes after its initial departure   In  The Pandorica Opens   2010   the TARDIS is drawn to a specific date  26 June 2010  and then caused to explode by an outside influence   The exterior dimensions can be severed from the interior dimensions under extraordinary circumstances  In Frontios  1984   when the TARDIS was destroyed in a Tractator induced meteor storm  the interior ended up outside the police box shell with various bits embedded in the surrounding rock  The Doctor eventually tricked the Gravis  leader of the Tractators  into reassembling the ship  In  Father s Day   2005   a temporal paradox resulting in a wound in time threw the interior of the ship out of the wound  leaving the TARDIS an empty shell of a police box  The Doctor attempted to use the TARDIS key in conjunction with a small electrical charge to recover the ship  but the process was interrupted and the TARDIS was only restored after the paradox was resolved   In  Turn Left   2008   the  Police Box  sign and all other text on the TARDIS is shown as replaced with the words  Bad Wolf   as is all text in the universe  this is interpreted by the Doctor as an urgent warning concerning the end of the universe  The words  Bad Wolf  have also been spray painted on and around the TARDIS in previous episodes  The TARDIS has the ability to turn invisible  allowing it to avoid the detection by President Nixon  Canton Everett Delaware III and Area 51 operatives   The Impossible Astronaut    Day of the Moon   2011     3 2  Interior  The TARDIS interior has an unknown number of rooms and corridors  and the dimensions of the interior have not been specified  In  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS   2013   the Doctor states that the TARDIS is actually infinite in size  Apart from living quarters  the interior includes a well organised study  TARDIS  2010   a swimming pool and bathroom  a sick bay  an ancillary power station disguised as an art gallery  and several brick walled storage areas  all seen in The Invasion of Time  1978   a  cloister room   an observatory  a library  a greenhouse  a baby room  a toy room and several squash courts  There is also a wooden panelled secondary control room  and numerous other rooms have been only mentioned in dialogue or in spin off media  see below   The Doctor flippantly mentions a karaoke bar in  The Girl Who Waited   2011   Portions of the TARDIS can also be reconfigured or  deleted   the Doctor was able to jettison 25% of the TARDIS s structure in Castrovalva to provide additional  thrust   In  The Doctor s Wife   2011   a fail safe transfers any living creatures in  deleted  rooms to the main control room  and old  and future  control rooms can be  archived  by the TARDIS without the Doctor s knowledge  Rooms within the TARDIS can be re arranged to suit the Doctor s needs  as when the Eleventh Doctor hastily moved the swimming pool beneath the TARDIS entrance in order to catch River Song in  Day of the Moon   alternatively he may have moved the door   In Full Circle  1980   Romana stated that the weight of the TARDIS was 5 × 106 kilograms in Alzarius s Earth like gravity  about 5 × 107 Newtons  or the weight of 5 000 tonnes   It has been speculated that this was a mistake by the character and referred to its internal weight  as the external part of the TARDIS is at other times light enough for it to be lifted or otherwise moved with relative ease  although most real police boxes were concrete and hence quite difficult to move   several men lift it up in Marco Polo  it is transported by truck and installed indoors by hand  all off screen  in Spearhead From Space  it requires a fork lift truck in Time Flight and is lifted in the cargo hold of a Concorde in the same serial  a group of small blue maintenance workers on Platform One push it along the ground in  The End of the World   and a quartet of Weeping Angels are able to rock it back and forth in  Blink   to name a few  In  The Day of the Doctor   2013  it is lifted by a helicopter using a steel cable  The TARDIS floats in Fury from the Deep but  conversely  remains stationary despite the tides in The Time Meddler  If the solid exterior of the TARDIS is moved or shaken after materialisation  the movement is usually transmitted to its interior   The Impossible Astronaut   2011   although there is a manual control to separate the internal gravity from the exterior s orientation  Time Flight  1982   The Twelfth Doctor states in  Flatline  that the TARDIS s weight is always adjusted  if it were not  its weight would shatter the Earth s surface   In the tie in novels  the interior of the TARDIS has been known to contain an entire city  Cat s Cradle  Time s Crucible   used to encompass an entire parallel Earth  Blood Heat   and is big enough to dwarf Gallifrey itself when turned inside out  The Ancestor Cell   It is also seen to exist in multiple timelines  In  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS  the TARDIS is shown to contain the Eye of Harmony  an exploding star in the process of becoming a black hole   A distinctive architectural feature of the TARDIS interior is the roundel  In the context of the TARDIS  a roundel is a circular decoration that adorns the walls of the rooms and corridors of the TARDIS  including the console room  Some roundels conceal TARDIS circuitry and devices  as seen in the serials The Wheel in Space  1968   Logopolis  Castrovalva  1981   Arc of Infinity  1983   Terminus  1983   and Attack of the Cybermen  1985   The design of the roundels has varied throughout the show s history  from a basic circular cut out with black background to a photographic image printed on wall board  to translucent illuminated discs in later serials  In the secondary console room  most of the roundels were executed in recessed wood panelling  with a few decorative ones in what appeared to be stained glass  In the TARDIS design from 2005 – January 2010  the roundels are built into hexagonal recesses in the walls  Ever since the TARDIS was redesigned at the beginning of the 2010 series  there have been a range of different roundel designs around the console room  These include circular holes that are recessed deep into the walls  hexagonal holes that are lit from behind each face  round indents with brass rings around the outside  and a glass centre that is illuminated blue   Other rooms seen include living quarters for many of the Doctor s companions  The TARDIS also had a  Zero Room   a chamber that was shielded from the rest of the universe and provided a restful environment for the Fifth Doctor to recover from his regeneration in Castrovalva  which was among the 25% jettisoned   However  the Seventh Doctor spin off novel Deceit indicated that the Doctor rebuilt the Zero Room shortly before the events of that novel  In some of the First Doctor serials  a nearby room contains a machine that dispenses food or nutrition bars to the Doctor and his companions  This machine disappears after the first few serials  although mention is occasionally made of the TARDIS kitchen  In The One Doctor  Mel mentions that the Doctor used the TARDIS s laundromat   Although the interior corridors were not initially seen in the 2005 series  the fact that they still exist was established in  The Unquiet Dead   when the Doctor gives Rose some very complicated directions to the TARDIS wardrobe  The wardrobe is mentioned several times in the original series and spin off fiction  and seen in The Androids of Tara  1978   The Twin Dilemma  1984  and Time and the Rani  1987   The redesigned version  from which the Tenth Doctor chooses his new clothes  was seen in  The Christmas Invasion   2005  as a large multi levelled room with a helical staircase  Designer Ed Thomas has suggested that more rooms may be seen in coming episodes  The corridors were eventually seen in the episode  The Doctor s Wife   and are currently standing sets for use in future episodes  The Doctor also mentions in  The Shakespeare Code  that the TARDIS has an attic   In  The Eleventh Hour   the Doctor mentions that the TARDIS has a library and a swimming pool  He tells Captain Avery that there are several bathrooms available in  The Curse of the Black Spot   2011   The swimming pool has been seen on screen in The Invasion of Time  1978   and the Doctor later used it to catch River Song as she plummeted from a skyscraper  The swimming pool  the scullery  squash court 7  the archived Ninth and Tenth Doctor s console room  and Amy and Rory s quarters were ejected in the episode  The Doctor s Wife   The Doctor reconstructed Amy and Rory s bedroom but replaced the bunk beds with a normal bed at their insistence  The swimming pool was seen again briefly in  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS  indicating it was later rebuilt as well   In the  Doctor Who  Adventure Games   the TARDIS has a  drawing room  containing items that the Doctor has used in past episodes  like the long scarf the Fourth Doctor used  the Second Doctor s recorder and items like the Fob Watch used to change the Doctor s Time Lord biology to human in the episode  Human Nature   The Drawing Room is the Doctor s private study  and the Doctor advised Amy Pond not to mess around with anything  and no one is allowed to sit in his chair   3 2 1  Console room  The most often seen room of the TARDIS is its console room  where its flight controls are housed  The console room was designed by Peter Brachacki and was the only set he designed for the show  It was built on a shoestring budget and a tight schedule  which led to Brachacki leaving the show due to disagreements with the production team and possibly a feeling that he had been given an impossible task  Despite his leaving the show and mixed reactions as to how the set looked  producer Verity Lambert liked it but director Waris Hussein did not   the basic design of the hexagonal console and wall roundels has persisted to the present day   The TARDIS has at least two console rooms  the primary one most used throughout the programme s history  and the secondary console room used during Season 14 in 1976 77  which has wood panelling and a more antique feel to it  It had been designed to make shooting more comfortable for the camera crew  Putting the console on a dais meant the cameramen no longer had to crouch for eye level shots  However the set walls warped after it was put into storage at the end of production and had to be discarded   In addition  a cavernous  steampunk inspired console room was used in the television movie and may have been a reconfiguration of either of the previously mentioned console rooms  as first suggested in New Adventures novels  most specifically the Lungbarrow by Marc Platt  where the TARDIS reconfigures the console room to reflect the interior of the Doctor s former home and later in the Big Finish Productions audio plays   In the Third Doctor serial The Time Monster  1972   the console room of the TARDIS was dramatically altered  including the wall roundels  This new set  designed by Tim Gleeson  was disliked by producer Barry Letts  who felt that the new roundels resembled washing up bowls stuck to the wall  As it turned out  the set was damaged in storage between production blocks and had to be rebuilt  so this particular design only saw service in the one serial   In the 2005 series  the console room became a dome shaped chamber with organic looking support columns  and the interior doors were removed  The change in configuration is explained in  Time Crash  by the Fifth Doctor as a mere changing of  the desktop theme  to  Coral   he also indicates that a  Leopard Skin  theme is also available  but he dislikes it   Other preceding theories involve the fact that the TARDIS interior was severely damaged by a cold fusion explosion in The Gallifrey Chronicles  Several episodes of the revived series  such as  Army of Ghosts  and the end of  The Unicorn and the Wasp   reveal that there is storage space directly underneath the console room  the Doctor is shown periodically obtaining equipment from this area via a panel in the floor  The 2005 console room was destroyed by the regeneration energy of the Tenth Doctor in the final scene of The End of Time and cold open of  The Eleventh Hour   although it made a reappearance in the 2011 episode  The Doctor s Wife  as well as the 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor  This console room has made the most appearances in the revived series  and is the most well known one  As of 2014 every Doctor and companion of the revived series has set foot in this console room  The console room is currently stored at the Doctor Who experience in Cardiff  A new console room  along with a new police box exterior  made its debut in the Eleventh Doctor s first episode  which aired on 3 April 2010  It was revealed in  The Doctor s Wife  that the older TARDIS interior designs are not destroyed or remodelled  but  archived  off the official schematic without the Doctor s knowledge  The TARDIS reveals that she has around thirty console rooms archived  even those that the Doctor has yet to use  These archived console rooms are still capable of controlling TARDIS functions as shown when Amy and Rory are able to lower the TARDIS shields from an archived control room  The active console room at a given time will be the one connected to the exterior doors for ingress and egress   A third console room design was unveiled in the 2012 Christmas special  The Snowmen   As opposed to the more open  unpredictable nature of the previous design  this set echoes the machine like 1980s TARDIS console  but is coloured in the more shadowy blues  greens and purples of the 1996 TV movie  Though the central pillar is still connected to the ceiling – a design element introduced in the 1996 movie  and continued in the 2005 series – it is now joined to three circular connectors marked with Gallifreyan symbols that twist clockwise and anticlockwise when the TARDIS is in flight   Showrunner Steven Moffat stated that the new design was meant to be more  scary  and machine like than the previous bright orange design  which was more  whimsical  to reflect upon the light hearted and fairy tale like nature of the episodes following its introduction in  The Eleventh Hour   The seventh series  darker  more adult tone necessitated a more menacing and mysterious console   also reflecting the implications that the TARDIS is distrustful of the Doctor s companion  Clara  For instance  in  Hide   Clara s statement that the TARDIS actively dislikes her is intercut with footage of its circular connectors spinning from the ceiling  For the eighth series  Peter Capaldi s first as the Doctor  this console was still used but was tweaked and altered slightly  including the addition of a blackboard and bookshelves and the time rotor was changed to an orange colour replacing the blue   A previously unseen version of the console room made an appearance in the 2013 serial The Day of the Doctor and is associated with the War Doctor portrayed by John Hurt  This console room has walls that are similar in design to those first seen in 1963  with multiple roundels illuminated from behind   The console room is the  safest place on the ship   and so when its occupants are in danger the TARDIS will reinvent its architecture so as to allow them to enter the console room  This can also result in the TARDIS materialising itself within its own console room when in grave danger  as it did in  Space  and  Time   As seen in  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS   the console room is able to be replicated any number of times to create  echo rooms   occupants in each of the different echo rooms will be able to feel the presence of the others in the forms of shadows and sounds  as the rooms are together for a brief second  with the rooms rapidly alternating between each other   like a light switch     flickering at super infinite speeds    The Virgin novels introduced a tertiary console room  which was described as resembling a Gothic cathedral  Nightshade by Mark Gatiss   Another novel  Death and Diplomacy by Dave Stone  suggested that the native configuration is so complex and irrational that most non Time Lords who witness it are driven mad from the experience   Throughout the programme s history there have been various attempts at humanising the console room by adding various accoutrements  For example  a hatstand has often been located somewhere in the room  and the first episodes featured an ormolu clock  In the series from 2005 onwards  the TARDIS console included a bench sitting area for the Doctor and or his companions to relax during extended flight  In The Androids of Tara  1978  a cupboard containing fishing gear is shown nearby  In  The Rebel Flesh   2011   a dartboard is seen installed in the console room  and it is revealed in the episode  Vincent and the Doctor  that the console is capable of playing recorded music  In keeping with the darker and more machine like setting of the 2012 redesign of the console room  there is no hat stand or bench  in  Hide   the Doctor and Clara both note that there is no longer anywhere in the room on which to hang Clara s umbrella   3 3  TARDIS console  The main feature of the console rooms  in any of the known configurations  is the TARDIS console that holds the instruments that control the ship s functions  The appearance of the primary TARDIS consoles has varied widely but shares common details  hexagonal pedestals with controls around the periphery  and a moveable column  or time rotor as it has been called in the original series and the 2011 episode  The Doctor s Wife   in the centre that bobs rhythmically up and down when the TARDIS is in flight  like a pump or a piston   The arrangement of the controls implies that the console was designed to be manned by more than one person  One piece of fan continuity  used in the spin off media  and also mentioned by the current production team  is that the intended number of operators is somewhere between three and six  In  Journey s End   the Doctor confirms that the intended number is six  Rose Tyler  Martha Jones  Sarah Jane Smith  Mickey Smith  Jack Harkness and the Doctor man the controls  and the TARDIS runs far more smoothly during that brief period than it normally does  This also explains why the Doctor tends to do a lot of manic running around the console while he is piloting the TARDIS  as well as the occasional difficulty he has in controlling it  although Romana  the Doctor s one time Time Lord companion  is able to pilot the TARDIS successfully by herself  Companion Professor River Song  herself a de facto Time Lord who was conceived aboard the TARDIS while transiting the time vortex  was also shown to pilot the TARDIS smoothly and easily without help   The Time of Angels    The Pandorica Opens    Let s Kill Hitler    The Angels Take Manhattan     The console can be operated independently of the TARDIS  During the Third Doctor s era  he occasionally detaches the console from the TARDIS to perform repairs on it  In Inferno  1970  the Doctor accidentally rides a detached console into a parallel universe  The eleventh doctor  Matt Smith  and Idris  the human body in whom his TARDIS   soul  was placed  flew a detached console to the Doctor s TARDIS in  The Doctor s Wife    The central column is often referred to as the  time rotor   although when the term was first used in The Chase  1965  it referred to a different instrument on the TARDIS console  However  the use of this term to describe the central column was common in fan literature  and was finally used on screen to refer to the central column in Arc of Infinity  1983  and Terminus  1983   The current production team uses the term in the same way  It was also referred to as the  time column  in Logopolis  1981    The secondary console was smaller  with the controls hidden behind wooden panels  and had no central column  The 1996 television movie console also appeared to be made of wood and the central column connected to the ceiling of the console room  The new series  console is circular in shape and divided into six segments  with both the control panels and the central column glowing green  the latter once again connected to the ceiling   The 2005 console has a much more thrown together appearance than previous consoles  with bits of junk from various eras substituting as makeshift controls  including a glass paperweight  a locomotive style water sight glass and protector  a small bell  and a bicycle pump  the latter identified in the Tenth Doctor interactive mini episode  Attack of the Graske  as the vortex loop control  Three other controls—the dimensional stabiliser  vector tracker  and the handbrake—were also identified  but although the stabiliser had been mentioned before in the series  the canonicity of the mini episode is also unclear  As seen in  World War Three   there is also a working telephone attached to the console  In the 2010 series  the new console includes items such as a washer fluid bottle from a car and a typewriter keyboard   Precisely how much control the Doctor has in directing the TARDIS has varied over the course of the series  The First Doctor did not initially seem to be able to steer it accurately  making only one intended landing to the planet Kembel in The Daleks  Master Plan  1965–6  by using the directional unit taken from another TARDIS before the unit burns out  During the Third Doctor s exile on Earth  the TARDIS s course is shown as controlled successfully by the Time Lords  and from the point the Time Lords unblock his memory of time travel mechanics in The Three Doctors  1972–3   the Doctor seems able to navigate correctly when needed   Over time the Doctor seemed to be able to pilot the TARDIS with more precision  In The Seeds of Death  the Second Doctor explains to Zoe Heriot that it would be impossible to use the TARDIS to fly from Earth to the Moon because it would likely  overshoot by a few million years  or a few million miles   However  in Logopolis  the Fourth Doctor is able to make a  short hop  to the exact coordinates when he initially lands the TARDIS 1 6 metres off target   Following the Key to Time season  1978–79   the Doctor installed a randomiser to the console which prevented the Doctor  and by extension the evil and powerful Black Guardian  from knowing where the TARDIS would land next  This device was eventually removed in The Leisure Hive  1980    In the 2005 and later series  the Doctor is shown piloting the TARDIS at will  although writers continue to use the plot device of having the TARDIS randomly land somewhere  or imply that the TARDIS is  temperamental  in its courses through time and space  such as missing his intended mark by a century  1879 instead of 1979  in  Tooth and Claw   2006   making the mistake of 12 months instead of 12 hours in  Aliens of London   2005   or getting the correct time but landing on the wrong continent  London instead of New York  in  The Idiot s Lantern   2006   He can also choose to  set the controls to random  as in  Planet of the Ood   2008   Although The Doctor s spacial accuracy in  The Eleventh Hour  was spot on  the TARDIS  malfunctioning Helmic regulator prevents him from controlling the exact time he arrives at  first promising a young Amelia that he would be gone for only five minutes  but taking 12 years to return  and again when he intended to leave Amy for a short while to give the newly regenerated TARDIS a brief shakedown cruise  and ends up returning another two years in the future  In  The Doctor s Wife  the reason why the Doctor seems to lack control over the TARDIS at times is explained  the TARDIS  soul  in the body of a humanoid named Idris  explained that while the TARDIS may not always take the Doctor where he wants to go  it always takes him where he needs to go   The Doctor in his eleventh incarnation was generally able to land the TARDIS with significantly superior accuracy to that of his predecessors  he returned four times to the same spot in Amy Pond s garden where he had crash landed and originally met her   2nd & 3rd arrivals  The Eleventh Hour    The Big Bang    The Angels Take Manhattan    he routinely materialised in front of the London house which he had given to her and her husband   The God Complex    The Doctor  the Widow and the Wardrobe    Pond Life  August    The Power of Three    or within her homes   Flesh and Stone    Pond Life  May    Dinosaurs on a Spaceship    The Power of Three    He delivered himself to the precise space time location where the pair  and  unbeknownst to them  their daughter River Song  had summoned him    Let s Kill Hitler   and his pin point accurate landings repeatedly allowed him to catch River and save her life   The Time of Angels    Day of the Moon    In  Asylum of the Daleks   2012  the Doctor is able to land with  pinpoint accuracy  in the Dalek ship  but he is surprised that he can  and boasts to the Daleks and his companions that he is able to   In  Boom Town   a portion of the TARDIS console opens to reveal a luminescent vapour within  described by the Doctor as the  heart of the TARDIS   harking back to the description in  The Edge of Destruction   In  The Parting of the Ways   2005  it was shown that this is connected to the powerful energies of the time vortex   The 1996 television movie was the first appearance of the central column being attached to the ceiling  However  a new design for the TARDIS console room was conceived after season 26  which featured the console being suspended from the ceiling via the central column  this design was never built because the show was cancelled before a 27th season was produced  however  the set was used in a Doctor Who night presented by Sylvester McCoy  where a miniature was built and McCoy was superimposed into it   4  TARDIS systems  Due to the age of the TARDIS  it is inclined to break down  The Doctor is often seen with his head stuck in a panel carrying out maintenance of some kind or another  and he occasionally has to give it  percussive maintenance   a good thump on the console  to get it to start working properly  Efforts to repair  control  and maintain the TARDIS have been frequent plot devices throughout the show s run  creating the amusing irony of a highly advanced time machine which  at the same time  is an obsolete and unreliable piece of junk  Additionally  the TARDIS was designed to be flown by six experienced Time Lords  as opposed to the one Doctor piloting  and  often  not very well    4 1  Controls  The TARDIS possesses telepathic circuits  although the Doctor prefers to pilot her manually  In Pyramids of Mars  1975   the Fourth Doctor told Sutekh that the TARDIS controls were  isomorphic   meaning only the Doctor could operate them  However  this characteristic seems to appear and disappear when dramatically convenient  and various companions have been seen to be able to operate the TARDIS and even fly it  In  Blink   the TARDIS was  pre programmed  to travel to a specific time  1969  and place by inserting a DVD into the console  The DVD was one of the 17 owned by Sally Sparrow on which the Doctor appeared as an  Easter egg   In this situation  however  the TARDIS dematerialised without transporting its occupants  Despite the changes in the layout of the console controls  the Doctor seems to have no difficulty in operating the ship  In  Time Crash   the Fifth Doctor is able to fly the TARDIS despite the layout being radically different from the one he was used to  at first without even noticing that the machine had changed  In the episode  Utopia   the TARDIS is taken by the Master and the Doctor is only able to use his sonic screwdriver to restrict the destination times to the last two previous selected destinations  In the Big Finish Productions audio play Other Lives  2005   the Eighth Doctor deactivates the isomorphism of the controls to allow his companion C rizz to operate the console   Apart from the sound that accompanies dematerialisation  in The Web of Fear  1968   the TARDIS console was also seen to have a light that winked on and off during landing  although the more usual indicator of flight is the movement of the central column  The TARDIS also possesses a scanner so that its crew may examine the exterior environment before exiting the ship  In the 2005 series the scanner display is attached to the console and is able to display television signals as well as various computing functions and occasionally what the production team has stated are Gallifreyan numbers and text   The 2005 series also sees the addition of the tribophysical waveform macro kinetic extrapolator to the TARDIS in the episode  Boom Town   This control was originally a pan dimensional  surf board  taken from the Slitheen  In  The Parting of the Ways   Captain Jack Harkness uses it to rig up a force field that defends the ship from Dalek missiles  The Doctor uses it again in the Christmas 2006 episode  The Runaway Bride   to jar it a few hundred metres off course when being dragged back to the Empress of Racnoss  in a similar manoeuvre to that used in The Web of Fear with another extra device he plugged into the console  In the last appearance  the TARDIS coral has begun to grow over the extrapolator   In the television movie  access to the Eye of Harmony is controlled by means of a device that requires a human eye to open  Why the Doctor would programme such a requirement is retroactively explained in the Big Finish Productions audio play The Apocalypse Element  where a Dalek invasion of Gallifrey prompts the Time Lords to code their security locks to the retinal patterns of the Sixth Doctor s companion Evelyn Smythe   The TARDIS came with an instruction manual that the Sixth Doctor claims in Vengeance on Varos to have started reading but never finished  Tegan Jovanka is unable to make sense of its contents  and Peri Brown later finds it propping open a vent  The usual function of the manual is to hold up a short leg on the Doctor s hat rack  though  Amy s Choice  features the Doctor revealing to have thrown it into a supernova  ostensibly due to disagreeing with it  Despite its complexity  some companions with exceptional intelligence  such as Nyssa  or familiarity with technology  such as Turlough and Jack Harkness  have been depicted as assisting the Doctor with TARDIS operations  In  The Sontaran Stratagem   Donna Noble displays an aptitude for piloting the TARDIS under the Doctor s guidance  much to the Doctor s apparent surprise  The Doctor s companion River Song claims to have been taught to pilot the TARDIS by  the very best    The Time of Angels    this turns out to have in fact been the TARDIS herself  rather than the Doctor   Let s Kill Hitler     In  Journey s End   the TARDIS is shown to ideally require six pilots positioned at various stations around the central console to be piloted properly  On that occasion  the six pilots were Rose Tyler  Martha Jones  Sarah Jane Smith  Mickey Smith  Jack Harkness  and the Doctor  However  the ending of the 2011 episode  The Doctor s Wife  reveals that the TARDIS is actually capable of manipulating the controls herself  which is consistent with stories in which the TARDIS is summoned or otherwise travels by herself without the input of a pilot  such as  The Two Doctors   1985  and  Hide   2013    In  The Time of Angels   2010   River Song reveals that the TARDIS has a  stabilisation  and  brake  option  The  stabilisation  prevents the TARDIS from moving violently in flight  River Song claimed that leaving the  brakes  on is the cause of the  de materialisation noise  However  other TARDISes have usually made the same sound when dematerialising and materialising  and it has even been identified as a particular component of every TARDIS  In  The Time of the Doctor   2013   the Doctor is able to  turn the engines on silent   The consciousness of the Doctor s TARDIS  when briefly transposed into the body of a humanoid woman in the  The Doctor s Wife   makes the sound in order to identify herself to the Doctor and is used when the TARDIS consciousness is transferred to and from the woman   4 2  Defences  If required  the TARDIS can become temporarily invisible  but this is a significant power drain  as seen in  The Impossible Astronaut   when the Doctor lands the TARDIS in the middle of the Oval Office in the White House   Despite its outside appearance  the TARDIS seems to be virtually impenetrable  When being chased by an Auton in  Rose   the Doctor reassures future companion Rose Tyler that  the assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn t break through those doors  and believe me  they ve tried    When fully active  the TARDIS s outer defences are  nearly  impenetrable  This is demonstrated in the last episode of The Armageddon Factor  In this episode  the Black Guardian is unable to enter the TARDIS after the Doctor activates     all of the TARDIS s defences     The result is that the Black Guardian is unable to obtain the much desired Key to Time  However  in  Journey s End  the Tenth Doctor states that the Daleks  created and led by Davros  would have no problem breaching the TARDIS defences   They re experts at fighting TARDISes  they can do anything  Right now  that wooden door is just wood    Some of the TARDIS s other functions include a force field and the Hostile Action Displacement System  HADS   which can  if switched on by the ship s operator  teleport the ship away if it is attacked  The Krotons  1968  or in great danger  Cold War  2013   The force field is seen in use in  The Runaway Bride   when the Tenth Doctor and the Bride  Donna Noble  are trying to escape the Empress of the Racnoss and in  The Beast Below   when the Doctor is showing Amy Pond the wonders of the universe  In  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS   the Eleventh Doctor turns off the shields by putting the TARDIS on  basic mode  for his companion  Clara  to operate  Another device  a tribophysical waveform macro kinetic extrapolator  is installed to generate a force field in the episode  Boom Town  and is later used to protect the ship from Dalek missiles in  The Parting of the Ways    The TARDIS s cloister bell is a signal used in the event of  wild catastrophes and sudden calls to man the battle stations   Logopolis    The interior of the TARDIS was described as being in a state of  temporal grace   The Hand of Fear  1976   The Fourth Doctor explains that  in a sense  things do not exist while inside the TARDIS  This had the practical effect of ensuring that no weapons can be used inside its environs  Since then weapons have been fired in the console room in Earthshock  1982   Attack of the Cybermen   The Parting of the Ways   and  Last of the Time Lords   among others  When confronted by Nyssa on this contradiction in Arc of Infinity  the Doctor responded   Yes  well  nobody s perfect   In The Invasion of Time  a guard s patrol staser will not function  even though K9 s nose laser does  The Doctor explains on this occasion that the staser will not work within the field of a relative dimensional stabiliser  such as that found in the TARDIS  In the audio story Human Resources  when a character mentions the temporal grace function  the Eighth Doctor  says that his TARDIS  hasn t done that in years   In  Let s Kill Hitler  the Doctor tells the  Mels  incarnation of River Song about the temporal grace system and she shoots something in the TARDIS as a result  causing it to crash  The Doctor then admits that temporal grace is actually just a  clever lie    The TARDIS can also use its living metal circuitry to continue to expand and change when required  as seen in  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS   when the TARDIS creates a continuing  labyrinth  around the occupants of the TARDIS  to stop the theft of a circuit  The layout of a room can also be changed  as when the door was removed in the room housing the Architectural Reconfiguration System  in an attempt to stop Gregor Van Baalen leaving with the circuit   The TARDIS also has another shield which keeps it from interacting with other objects in the time vortex  namely other TARDISes  When the Doctor forgets to restore these shields after the events of  Last of the Time Lords   he ends up merging his TARDIS with that of his fifth incarnation in the mini episode  Time Crash   After successfully separating the two  the bow of the alien spaceship called Titanic  designed to look like the ship of the same name  smashes through the inside wall of the TARDIS before he can raise it again  The damage is repaired  however  when the Doctor reverses time  pulling the Titanic back so the breach never occurred  Despite the shield being designed to keep the TARDIS from interacting with itself  its own interior is considered the safest place  and the ship will thus effect an emergency materialisation within itself under certain circumstances  This occurred in the mini episodes Space and Time  when Rory Williams  accidental dropping of a thermal coupling prompts the TARDIS  exterior to materialise within its interior  thereby trapping the ship and its occupants in a space loop  In  The Doctor s Wife   the Doctor s makeshift TARDIS materialises within the Doctor s own TARDIS  but only after Idris telepathically instructs the Doctor s companions  trapped aboard by the House entity  to deactivate the TARDIS s defences from an  archived  control room   4 3  Programming  The TARDIS can be programmed to execute automatic functions based on certain conditions  The Ninth Doctor used Emergency Programme One to send Rose home in  The Parting of the Ways   It was programmed to return to the Doctor upon the detection of the presence of one of Sally Sparrow s DVDs in  Blink   Emergency Programme One will also send Donna Noble back to her own time period if she is left alone in the TARDIS for more than five hours  In  Voyage of the Damned   the TARDIS will lock on to the nearest planetary body to land there when it becomes adrift in space  The TARDIS automatically repairs after too much damage  as in  Voyage of the Damned  when it repairs itself after the spaceship Titanic crashes through its walls   4 4  Other systems  The TARDIS also grants its passengers the ability to understand and speak other languages  This was previously described in The Masque of Mandragora  1976  as a  Time Lord gift  I allow you to share   which the Doctor shared with his companions  but was ultimately attributed to the TARDIS s telepathic field in  The End of the World   2005   In  The Christmas Invasion   it was revealed that the Doctor himself is an integral element of this capability  Rose is unable to understand the alien Sycorax whilst the Doctor is in a regenerative crisis  In  The Impossible Planet   2006   it is said that the TARDIS normally even translates writing  in that episode  the TARDIS is unable to translate an alien script  which the Doctor claims makes the language  impossibly old   However  the TARDIS does not translate Gallifreyan  as seen in  Utopia   when the Doctor was reading Gallifreyan numbers from the console monitor to tell where the TARDIS was going  and again in  A Good Man Goes to War   in which the Gallifreyan script on the Doctor s crib remains unintelligible to the audience and the Ponds  River Song also explains in  A Good Man Goes to War  that the TARDIS  translation matrix can take  a while to kick in  for the written word  actually coming into effect after the departure of the Doctor and the TARDIS  In the Ninth Doctor Adventures novel Only Human  the telepathic field includes a filter that replaces foul or undesirable language with more acceptable terms  In  The Fires of Pompeii   it is shown that if a TARDIS traveller speaks in a hearer s own language  the translation circuit renders these words appropriately as foreign to the listener s ear  for example  if an English speaking TARDIS traveller speaks Latin to an ancient Roman  the Roman hears that Latin as  Celtic  or Welsh   It also affects the translation of accents  in  Vincent and the Doctor   a translated Scottish accent is heard by a Dutchman and understood as a Dutch accent  though that accent translation was also an outside reference to the speaker and hearer both being played by actors whose native accent was Scottish   The translation circuit does not always function  even for the Doctor  In Four to Doomsday  the Doctor is unable to understand the Aboriginal dialect spoken by a tribesman and the Doctor s companion Tegan  Similarly  Martha Jones is initially unable to understand the Hath in the episode  The Doctor s Daughter  and although she is eventually able to communicate with them  the audience is never allowed to understand their words   The TARDIS is able to tow other objects  a neutron star in the The Creature from the Pit  1979  a ship in  The Satan Pit   2006   or follow a ship or a transmission through space and time   The Empty Child   2005  and  The Stolen Earth   2008   In  Journey s End   the TARDIS  assisted by the Rift Manipulator situated at Torchwood Three in Cardiff and the supercomputer Mr Smith  is able to tow the Earth across space   At times the TARDIS is shown to have a mind of its own  It is heavily implied in the television series that the TARDIS is  alive  and intelligent to a degree  first in The Edge of Destruction   and shares a bond with those who travel in it  in the television movie  the Doctor calls the TARDIS  sentimental   In  The Parting of the Ways   the Doctor leaves a message for Rose when he believes he will never return  asking her to let the TARDIS die  In the same episode  Rose claims that the TARDIS is alive  echoing the Doctor s earlier statement in  Boom Town   The Doctor s TARDIS is also explicitly said to have died in the episode  Rise of the Cybermen   though the Doctor is able to revive it by giving up some of his life energy  reducing his life expectancy by a decade in the process   Other abilities the TARDIS displays include creating snow via  atmospheric excitation    The Runaway Bride   and  through a  chameleon arch   engineering an almost witness protection style relocation by making its Time Lord another species and placing him her in a newly fabricated identity with new memories somewhere else in space and time   Human Nature    The Family of Blood    Utopia    In  The Doctor s Wife   the TARDIS s intelligence is temporarily transferred to a humanoid body  during which time it is shown to possess a degree of precognition as well as limited telepathic abilities and a genuine fondness for the Doctor and his companions  This episode also demonstrates that certain capabilities of the physical TARDIS are operable independently of its intelligence  in particular the physical TARDIS s internal password security system  which is language independent  relying on meanings rather than the words themselves  and ability to travel between  bubble universes   In  The Name of the Doctor   the TARDIS actively resists traveling to the planet Trenzalore  the site of the Doctor s grave  and once there  forces the Doctor to crash land it on the planet s surface   The TARDIS is also able to place particular areas of the ship in  time stasis   as is in  Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS  where the engine had exploded and the TARDIS  wrapped around the force  of the explosion as a temporary safety measure   In the novels  a portion of the TARDIS could be separated and used for independent travel  This was featured in two Virgin novels  Iceberg by Davis Banks and Sanctuary by David A  McIntee  This subset of the TARDIS  resembling a small pagoda fashioned out of jade  had limited range and functionality  but was used occasionally when the main TARDIS was incapacitated  The sentient characteristics of the TARDIS have been made more explicit in the spin off novels and audio plays  In the Big Finish audio play Omega  the Doctor meets a TARDIS which  dies  after its Time Lord master s demise   5  Other TARDISes  Other TARDISes have appeared in the television series  The first was that of the Meddling Monk  another Time Lord  in the 1965 serial The Time Meddler  The Master had at least two TARDISes of his own  each a more advanced model than the Doctor s  The chameleon circuits on these were fully functional  and his TARDISes have been seen in various forms  including a fully functional spacecraft  a Concorde aircraft  a grandfather clock  a computer  a fireplace  a Doric pillar  a lorry  a statue  able to move and walk around   a laurel tree  and an iron maiden  In the reconstructed Shada  the Time Lord known as Professor Chronotis has a TARDIS disguised as his quarters at Cambridge University   Another renegade Time Lord  the Rani  appears with her TARDIS  In The Armageddon Factor  the Time Lord Drax has a TARDIS  but it is in need of repair  The War Chief provided dimensionally transcendent time machines named SIDRATs to the alien race known as the  War Lords   In the script for The Chase  Dalek time machines are known as DARDISes   In the spin off media  Gallifreyan Battle TARDISes have appeared in the comic books  novels and audio plays  which fire  time torpedoes  that freeze the target in time  The renegade Time Lady Iris Wildthyme s own TARDIS was disguised as a No  22 London bus  but was slightly smaller on the inside than it is on the outside  The Eighth Doctor Adventures novels have stated that future model Type 102 TARDISes will be fully sentient  and able to take on humanoid form  The Eighth Doctor s companion Compassion was the first Type 102 TARDIS  and she was seen to have enough firepower to annihilate other TARDISes  Compassion and other humanoid time ships appear in the Faction Paradox spin off material   The  unofficial  Ninth Doctor from the 40th anniversary animated webcast Scream of the Shalka had a TARDIS console room that looked similar to the Eighth Doctor s version  This console was covered in an array of clock like dials  featured a long spiral staircase leading far above the console  and connected to a nearby room resembling a Victorian library and study  Due to the freedom afforded by the medium of animation  this TARDIS is the first and only to feature an interior with no walls   In the Big Finish audio play The One Doctor  confidence trickster Banto Zame impersonated the Doctor  However  due to incomplete information  his copy of the TARDIS  a short range transporter  was called a  Stardis   resembled a portaloo rather than a police box  and was not dimensionally transcendental  In Unregenerate   the Seventh Doctor and Mel stopped a secret Time Lord project to download TARDIS minds into bodies of various alien species  This would have created living TARDIS pilots loyal to the Time Lords and ensuring that they would have ultimate control over any use of time travel technology by other races  Those created before the project was shut down departed on their own to explore the universe   Since the destruction of Gallifrey and the Time Lords shown in the 2005 series  the Doctor believes that his TARDIS is the last in the universe  The removal of Gallifrey – and by implication the Eye of Harmony – may also be why the TARDIS in  Boom Town  needed to refuel using radiation from a space time rift  although the Doctor was able to utilise a  subset of the Eye of Harmony  in the episode  Hide   2013   In  Rise of the Cybermen  the Doctor states that the TARDIS draws power from  the universe   but is unable to do so while in an alternative reality   The 28 October 2006 Radio Times  in an image of the Torchwood Three headquarters  identified a piece of large coral on Captain Jack Harkness s desk as the beginnings of a TARDIS  John Barrowman  who plays Jack  said that  Jack s growing a TARDIS    It s probably been there for 30 years  I suppose in 500 years he ll be able to begin the carving process    In the 2008 Christmas Special edition   The Next Doctor   Jackson Lake  David Morrissey   while under the delusion that he is the Doctor  has a blue gas balloon which he identifies as his TARDIS  which he explains stands for  Tethered Aerial Release Developed In Style   It is not capable of time travel   In a deleted scene from the series 4 finale  Journey s End   the Doctor gave a piece of the TARDIS to the half human Doctor clone so that the latter could grow his own  When the clone remarked that growing a TARDIS would take hundreds of years  Donna Noble provided him with a method of speeding up the process   In  The Lodger  a vessel  which the Doctor identifies as a somebody s attempt to build a TARDIS  lures in unsuspecting people to pilot its controls  all of whom die due to humans being incompatible with the process  The same interior was used by the Silence in  Day of the Moon   and the similarity commented on by the Doctor as he enters   but the intended connections between the two are still mostly unknown   In  The Doctor s Wife   the Doctor and the human avatar of his TARDIS  matrix  aka Idris  view a valley filled with parts of  half eaten TARDISes   which upsets Idris  Later  the Doctor builds a makeshift TARDIS out of components of the dead TARDISes to be able to save Rory and Amy who are trapped inside his TARDIS  which is now under the control of a malevolent entity  But he still requires energy from Idris in order to make it work  The console used for this episode was designed by the winner of a Blue Peter competition in 2010   6  Other appearances  6 1  Spin offs  The sound of the Doctor s TARDIS featured in the final scene of the Torchwood episode  End of Days   As Torchwood Three s hub is situated at a rift of temporal energy  the Doctor often appears on Roald Dahl Plass directly above it in order to recharge the TARDIS  In the episode  Jack Harkness hears the tell tale sound of the engines  smiles and afterwards is nowhere to be found  the scene picks up in the cold open of the Doctor Who episode  Utopia  in which Jack runs to and holds onto the TARDIS just before it disappears   Former and recurring companion  Sarah Jane Smith  has a diagram of the TARDIS in her attic  as shown in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode  Invasion of the Bane   In the episode The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith  Sarah Jane becomes trapped in 1951 and briefly mistakes an actual police public call box for the Doctor s TARDIS  the moment is even heralded by the Doctor s musical cue  frequently used in the revived series   It makes a full appearance in The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith  in which the Doctor briefly welcomes Sarah Jane s three adolescent companions into the control room  It then serves as a backdrop for the farewell scene between Sarah Jane and the Tenth Doctor  which echoed nearly word for word her final exchange with the Fourth Doctor aboard the TARDIS in 1976  During the Eleventh Doctor era it reappears in Death of the Doctor  is stolen by the Shansheeth who try to use it as an immortality machine  and transports Sarah Jane  Jo Grant and their adolescent companions  Rani Chandra  Clyde Langer and Santiago Jones    6 2  Merchandising  As one of the most recognisable images connected with Doctor Who  the TARDIS has appeared on numerous items of merchandise associated with the programme  TARDIS scale models of various sizes have been manufactured to accompany other Doctor Who dolls and action figures  some with sound effects included  Fan built full size models of the police box are also common  There have been TARDIS shaped video games  play
