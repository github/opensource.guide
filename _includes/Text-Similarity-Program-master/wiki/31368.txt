Terence Hanbury  Tim  White  29 May 1906 – 17 January 1964  was an English author best known for his sequence of Arthurian novels  The Once and Future King  first published together in 1958  One of his most memorable stories is the first of that series   The Sword in the Stone   published as a stand alone book in 1938   1  Biography  White was born in Bombay  British India  to English parents  Garrick Hanbury White who was an Indian police superintendent  and Constance White  Terence White had a discordant childhood  with an alcoholic father and an emotionally cold mother  and his parents separated when Terence was fourteen   1 1  Education and teaching  White went to Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire  a public school  and Queens  College  Cambridge  where he was tutored by the scholar and occasional author L  J  Potts  Potts became a lifelong friend and correspondent  and White later referred to him as  the great literary influence in my life   While at Queens  College  White wrote a thesis on Thomas Malory s Le Morte d Arthur  and graduated in 1928 with a first class degree in English   White then taught at Stowe School  Buckinghamshire  for four years  In 1936 he published England Have My Bones  a well received memoir about a year spent in England  The same year  he left Stowe and lived in a workman s cottage  where he wrote and  revert ed  to a feral state   engaging in falconry  hunting  and fishing  White also became interested in aviation  partly to conquer his fear of heights   1 2  Novelist  White s novel Earth Stopped  1934  and its sequel Gone to Ground  1935  are science fiction novels about a disaster which devastates the world  Gone to Ground contains several fantasy stories told by the survivors  these stories were later reprinted in The Maharajah and Other Stories   White wrote to a friend that in autumn 1937   I got desperate among my books and picked  Malory  up in lack of anything else  Then I was thrilled and astonished to find that  a  The thing was a perfect tragedy  with a beginning  a middle and an end implicit in the beginning and  b  the characters were real people with recognizable reactions which could be forecast      Anyway  I somehow started writing a book    The novel  which White described as  a preface to Malory   was titled The Sword in the Stone  Published in 1938 it told the story of the boyhood of King Arthur  White was also influenced by Freudian psychology and his lifelong involvement in natural history  The Sword in the Stone was well reviewed and was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1939   In February 1939  White moved to Doolistown  County Meath  Ireland  where he lived out the international crisis and the Second World War itself as a de facto conscientious objector  It was in Ireland that he wrote most of what would later become The Once and Future King  two sequels to The Sword in the Stone were published during this time  The Witch in the Wood  later cut and rewritten as The Queen of Air and Darkness  in 1939  and The Ill Made Knight in 1940  The version of The Sword in the Stone included in The Once and Future King differs in several respects from the earlier version  It is darker  and some critics prefer the earlier version  White s indirect experience of the war had a profound effect on these tales of King Arthur  which include commentaries on war and human nature in the form of a heroic narrative   1 3  Alderney  later work  and death  In 1946  White settled in Alderney  third largest of the Channel Islands  where he lived for the rest of his life  The same year  White published Mistress Masham s Repose  a children s book in which a young girl discovers a group of Lilliputians  the tiny people in Swift s Gulliver s Travels  living near her house  Mistress Masham s Repose was influenced by John Masefield s book The Midnight Folk   In 1947  he published The Elephant and the Kangaroo  in which a repetition of Noah s Flood occurs in Ireland  In the early 1950s White published two non fiction books  The Age of Scandal  1950   a collection of essays about 18th century England  and The Goshawk  1951   an account of White s attempt to train a Northern Goshawk using traditional  rather than modern  falconry techniques  Written while at his cottage in the mid 1930s  it was only published after its chance discovery by  and at the insistence of  White s agent  David Garnett  In 1954 White translated and edited The Book of Beasts  an English translation of a medieval bestiary originally written in Latin   In 1958 White completed the fourth book of The Once and Future King sequence  The Candle in the Wind  though it was first published with the other three parts and has never been published separately  White lived to see his work adapted as the Broadway musical Camelot  1960  and the animated film The Sword in the Stone  1963   both based on The Once and Future King   White died of heart failure on 17 January 1964 aboard ship in Piraeus  Athens  Greece   en route to Alderney from a lecture tour in the United States  He is buried in First Cemetery of Athens  In 1977 The Book of Merlyn  a conclusion to The Once and Future King  was published posthumously  His papers are held by the University of Texas at Austin   1 4  Personal life  According to Sylvia Townsend Warner s 1967 biography  White was  a homosexual and a sado masochist   He came close to marrying several times but had no enduring romantic relationships  and wrote in his diaries of Zed  a young boy   I have fallen in love with Zed       the whole situation is an impossible one  All I can do is behave like a gentleman  It has been my hideous fate to be born with an infinite capacity for love and joy with no hope of using them    Broadcaster Robert Robinson published an account of a bizarre conversation with White  in which he claimed to be attracted to small girls  Robinson concluded that this was really a cover for homosexuality  Julie Andrews wrote in her autobiography   I believe Tim may have been an unfulfilled homosexual  and he suffered a lot because of it    However  White s long time friend and literary agent  David Higham  wrote   Tim was no homosexual  though I think at one time he had feared he was  and in his ethos fear would have been the word    Higham gave Warner the address of one of White s lovers  so that she could get in touch with someone so important in Tim s story  But she never  the girl told me  took that step  So she was able to present Tim in such a light that a reviewer could call him a raging homosexual  Perhaps a heterosexual affair would have made her blush    Lin Carter in his book Imaginary Worlds portrayed White as a man who felt deeply but was unable to form close human relationships due to his unfortunate childhood   He was a man with an enormous capacity for loving  It shows in his prodigious correspondence and in his affection for dogs and in the bewildered and inarticulate loves his characters experience in his books  but he had few close friends  and no genuine relationship with a woman    White was agnostic  and towards the end of his life a heavy drinker  Warner wrote of him   Notably free from fearing God  he was basically afraid of the human race    2  Influence  Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock enjoyed White s The Once and Future King  and was especially influenced by the underpinnings of realism in his work  Moorcock eventually engaged in a  wonderful correspondence  with White  and later recalled that  White  gave  me some very good advice on how to write    J  K  Rowling has said that T  H  White s writing strongly influenced the Harry Potter books  several critics have compared Rowling s character Albus Dumbledore to White s absent minded Merlyn  and Rowling herself has described White s Wart as  Harry s spiritual ancestor   Author Neil Gaiman was asked about the similarities between Harry Potter and Gaiman s character Timothy Hunter  and he stated that he did not think Rowling had based her character on Hunter   I said to  the reporter  that I thought we were both just stealing from T  H  White  very straightforward    Gregory Maguire was influenced by  White s ability to be intellectually broadminded  to be comic  to be poetic  and to be fantastic  in the writing of his 1995 novel Wicked  and crime fiction writer Ed McBain also cited White as an influence   T  H  White features in the 2014 prize winning book H is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald  One of the components of the book is a biographical account of White and also The Goshawk  an account of his own failed attempt to train a hawk   3  Selected bibliography  Loved Helen  1929   The Green Bay Tree  1929   First Lesson  1932   as James Aston   They Winter Abroad  1932   as James Aston
