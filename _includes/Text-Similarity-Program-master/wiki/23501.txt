The potato is a starchy  tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum L  The word  potato  may refer either to the plant itself or the edible tuber  In the Andes  where the species is indigenous  there are some other closely related cultivated potato species  Potatoes were introduced outside the Andes region approximately four centuries ago  and have since become an integral part of much of the world s food supply  It is the world s fourth largest food crop  following maize  wheat  and rice   Wild potato species occur throughout the Americas from the United States to southern Chile  The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations  but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia  from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex   where they were domesticated approximately 7 000–10 000 years ago  Following centuries of selective breeding  there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes  Over 99% of the presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south central Chile  which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andean highlands   However  the local importance of potato is extremely variable and rapidly changing  It remains an essential crop in Europe  especially eastern and central Europe   where per capita production is still the highest in the world  but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia  As of 2007 China led the world in potato production  and nearly a third of the world s potatoes were harvested in China and India   1  Etymology  The English word potato comes from Spanish patata  the name used in Spain   The Spanish Royal Academy says the Spanish word is a compound of the Taino batata  sweet potato  and the Quechua papa  potato   The name potato originally referred to a type of sweet potato rather than the other way around  although the two plants are not closely related  in many of the chronicles detailing agriculture and plants  no distinction is made between the two  The 16th century English herbalist John Gerard used the terms  bastard potatoes  and  Virginia potatoes  for this species  and referred to sweet potatoes as  common potatoes   Potatoes are occasionally referred to as  Irish potatoes  or  white potatoes  in the United States  to distinguish them from sweet potatoes   The name spud for a small potato comes from the digging of soil  or a hole  prior to the planting of potatoes  The word has an unknown origin and was originally  c  1440  used as a term for a short knife or dagger  probably related to Dutch spyd or the Latin  spad   root meaning  sword   cf  Spanish  espada   English  spade  and  spadroon   The word spud traces back to the 16th century  It subsequently transferred over to a variety of digging tools  Around 1845  the name transferred to the tuber itself  The origin of the word  spud  has erroneously been attributed to a 19th century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out of Britain  calling itself The Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet  It was Mario Pei s 1949 The Story of Language that can be blamed for the word s false origin  Pei writes   the potato  for its part  was in disrepute some centuries ago  Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes formed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet  The initials of the main words in this title gave rise to spud   Like most other pre 20th century acronymic origins  this is false   2  Characteristics  Potato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow about 60 cm  24 in  high  depending on variety  with the culms dying back after flowering  fruiting and tuber formation  They bear white  pink  red  blue  or purple flowers with yellow stamens  In general  the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins  while those of varieties with colored flowers tend to have pinkish skins  Potatoes are mostly cross pollinated by insects such as bumblebees  which carry pollen from other potato plants  though a substantial amount of self fertilizing occurs as well  Tubers form in response to decreasing day length  although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties  After flowering  potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes  each containing about 300 seeds  Like all parts of the plant except the tubers  the fruit contain the toxic alkaloid solanine and are therefore unsuitable for consumption  All new potato varieties are grown from seeds  also called  true potato seed    TPS  or  botanical seed  to distinguish it from seed tubers  New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers  pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes  or cuttings  a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers  Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent  whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties   3  Genetics  There are about 5 000 potato varieties worldwide  Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone  mainly in Peru  Bolivia  Ecuador  Chile  and Colombia  They belong to eight or nine species  depending on the taxonomic school  Apart from the 5 000 cultivated varieties  there are about 200 wild species and subspecies  many of which can be cross bred with cultivated varieties  Cross breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species  Genetically modified varieties have met public resistance in the United States and in the European Union   The major species grown worldwide is Solanum tuberosum  a tetraploid with 48 chromosomes   and modern varieties of this species are the most widely cultivated  There are also four diploid species  with 24 chromosomes   S  stenotomum  S  phureja  S  goniocalyx  and S  ajanhuiri  There are two triploid species  with 36 chromosomes   S  chaucha and S  juzepczukii  There is one pentaploid cultivated species  with 60 chromosomes   S  curtilobum  There are two major subspecies of Solanum tuberosum  andigena  or Andean  and tuberosum  or Chilean  The Andean potato is adapted to the short day conditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated  the Chilean potato  however  native to the Chiloé Archipelago  is adapted to the long day conditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile   The International Potato Center  based in Lima  Peru  holds an ISO accredited collection of potato germplasm  The international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium announced in 2009 that they had achieved a draft sequence of the potato genome  The potato genome contains 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs  making it a medium sized plant genome  More than 99 percent of all current varieties of potatoes currently grown are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands of south central Chile  Nonetheless  genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species affirms that all potato subspecies derive from a single origin in the area of present day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia  from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex    Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources  however  at least one wild potato species  Solanum fendleri  is found as far north as Texas and is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes  A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico  where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found  such as the hexaploid Solanum demissum  as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease  Another relative native to this region  Solanum bulbocastanum  has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight   Potatoes yield abundantly with little effort  and adapt readily to diverse climates as long as the climate is cool and moist enough for the plants to gather sufficient water from the soil to form the starchy tubers  Potatoes do not keep very well in storage and are vulnerable to molds that feed on the stored tubers and quickly turn them rotten  however  crops such as grain can be stored for several years with a low risk of rot   4  History  The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia between 8000 and 5000 BC  It has since spread around the world and become a staple crop in many countries   According to conservative estimates  the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900  Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire  the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century  The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world  The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers  but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom  However  lack of genetic diversity  due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced  left the crop vulnerable to disease  In 1845  a plant disease known as late blight  caused by the fungus like oomycete Phytophthora infestans  spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland  resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine  Thousands of varieties still persist in the Andes however  where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley  and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household   5  Role in world food supply  The United Nations FAO reports that the world production of potatoes in 2010 was about 324 million tonnes  Just over two thirds of the global production is eaten directly by humans with the rest being fed to animals or used to produce starch  This means that the annual diet of an average global citizen in the first decade of the 21st century included about 33 kg  or 73 lb  of potato  However  the local importance of potato is extremely variable and rapidly changing  It remains an essential crop in Europe  especially eastern and central Europe   where per capita production is still the highest in the world  but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia  As of 2007  China led the world in potato production  and nearly a third of the world s potatoes were harvested in China and India  The geographic shift of potato production has been away from wealthier countries toward lower income areas of the world  although the degree of this trend is ambiguous   In 2008  several international organizations highlighted the potato s role in world food production  in the face of developing economic problems  They cited its potential derived from its status as a cheap and plentiful crop that grows in a wide variety of climates and locales  Due to perishability  only about 5% of the world s potato crop is traded internationally  its minimal presence in world financial markets contributed to its stable pricing during the 2007–2008 world food price crisis  Thus  the United Nations officially declared 2008 as the International Year of the Potato  to raise its profile in developing nations  calling the crop a  hidden treasure   This followed the International Rice Year in 2004   6  Nutrition  The potato contains vitamins and minerals  as well as an assortment of phytochemicals  such as carotenoids and natural phenols  Chlorogenic acid constitutes up to 90% of the potato tuber natural phenols  Others found in potatoes are 4 O caffeoylquinic acid  crypto chlorogenic acid   5 O caffeoylquinic  neo chlorogenic acid   3 4 dicaffeoylquinic and 3 5 dicaffeoylquinic acids  A medium size 150 g  5 3 oz  potato with the skin provides 27 mg of vitamin C  45% of the Daily Value  DV    620 mg of potassium  18% of DV   0 2 mg vitamin B6  10% of DV  and trace amounts of thiamin  riboflavin  folate  niacin  magnesium  phosphorus  iron  and zinc   The potato is best known for its carbohydrate content  approximately 26 grams in a medium potato   The predominant form of this carbohydrate is starch  A small but significant portion of this starch is resistant to digestion by enzymes in the stomach and small intestine  and so reaches the large intestine essentially intact  This resistant starch is considered to have similar physiological effects and health benefits as fiber  It provides bulk  offers protection against colon cancer  improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity  lowers plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations  increases satiety  and possibly even reduces fat storage  The amount of resistant starch in potatoes depends much on preparation methods  Cooking and then cooling potatoes significantly increases resistant starch  For example  cooked potato starch contains about 7% resistant starch  which increases to about 13% upon cooling   The storage and cooking method used can significantly affect the nutrient availability of the potato   Potatoes are often broadly classified as high on the glycemic index  GI  and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low GI diet  In fact  the GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on type  such as red  russet  white  or Prince Edward   origin  where it was grown   preparation methods  i e   cooking method  whether it is eaten hot or cold  whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole  etc    and with what it is consumed  i e   the addition of various high fat or high protein toppings    In the UK  potatoes are not considered by the NHS as counting towards the five portions of fruit and vegetables diet   6 1  Comparison to other major staple foods  The following table shows the nutrient content of potato and other major staple foods  each in respective raw form  Staple foods are not commonly eaten raw and are usually sprouted or cooked before eating  In sprouted and cooked form  the relative nutritional and anti nutritional contents of each of these grains may be different from the values reported in this table   6 2  Toxicity  Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as glycoalkaloids  of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine  Solanine is also found in other plants in the family Solanaceae  which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade  Atropa belladonna   henbane  Hyoscyamus niger   tobacco  Nicotiana   as well as eggplant and tomato   These compounds  which protect the plant from its predators  are  in general  concentrated in its leaves  stems  sprouts  and fruits  In a summary of several studies  the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh  in order from highest to lowest content  generally  flowers  sprouts  leaves  skin  roots  berries  peel  skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh   stems  and tuber flesh   Exposure to light  physical damage  and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber  Cooking at high temperatures —over 170 °C  340 °F  — partly destroys these  The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans  Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches  diarrhea  cramps  and in severe cases coma and death  however  poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely  Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis  thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic  however  this does not provide a definitive guide  as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other  Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others  breeders developing new varieties test for this  and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar  Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200 mg kg  200 ppmw   However  when these commercial varieties turn green  even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000 mg kg  1000 ppmw   In normal potatoes  analysis has shown solanine levels may be as little as 3 5% of the breeders  maximum  with 7–187 mg kg being found  While a normal potato has 12–20 mg kg of glycoalkaloid content  a green tuber contains 250–280 mg kg  and green skin 1500–2200 mg kg   The U S  National Toxicology Program suggests that the average American consume at most 12 5 mg day of solanine from potatoes  the toxic dose is actually several times this  depending on body weight   Douglas L  Holt  the State Extension Specialist for Food Safety at the University of Missouri  notes that no reported cases of potato source solanine poisoning have occurred in the U S  in the last 50 years  and most cases involved eating green potatoes or drinking potato leaf tea   7  Growth and cultivation  Potatoes are generally grown from seed potatoes – these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants  To be disease free  the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care  In the USA this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of the 50 states that grow potatoes  These locations are selected for their cold hard winters that kill pests and long sunshine hours in the summer for optimum growth  In the UK  most seed potatoes originate in Scotland in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus pathogens  Potato growth has been divided into five phases  During the first phase  sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins  During the second  photosynthesis begins as the plant develops leaves and branches  In the third phase stolons develop from lower leaf axils on the stem and grow downwards into the ground and on these stolons new tubers develop as swellings of the stolon  This phase is often  but not always  associated with flowering  Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures reach   hence potatoes are considered a cool season crop  Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase  when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers  At this stage  several factors are critical to yield  optimal soil moisture and temperature  soil nutrient availability and balance  and resistance to pest attacks  The final phase is maturation  The plant canopy dies back  the tuber skins harden  and their sugars convert to starches   New tubers may arise at the soil surface  Since exposure to light leads to greening of the skins and the development of solanine  growers are interested in covering such tubers  Commercial growers usually address this problem by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows   hilling   or in British English  earthing up    An alternative method used by home gardeners and smaller scale growers involves covering the growing area with organic mulches such as straw or with plastic sheets   Correct potato husbandry can be an arduous task in some circumstances  Good ground preparation  harrowing  plowing  and rolling are always needed  along with a little grace from the weather and a good source of water  Three successive plowings  with associated harrowing and rolling  are desirable before planting  Eliminating all root weeds is desirable in potato cultivation  In general  the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed  Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil  Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers  young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row  Seed potato crops are  rogued  in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop   Potatoes are sensitive to heavy frosts  which damage them in the ground  Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting  which can quickly ruin a large stored crop   At harvest time  gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long handled  three prong  grape   or graip   i e   a spading fork  or a potato hook  which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90° angle to the handle  In larger plots  the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes  Commercial harvesting is typically done with large potato harvesters  which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth  This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide  which separates some of the dirt  The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs  Different designs use different systems at this point  The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers  along with a blower system or  Flying Willard  to separate the potatoes from the plant  The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material  stones  and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck  Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage   Immature potatoes may be sold as  new potatoes  and are particularly valued for taste  These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by  grabbling   i e  pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place   Potatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin set  Skin set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage  Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations  Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal  Wound healing prevents infection and water loss from the tubers during storage  Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures with high humidity and good gas exchange if at all possible   7 1  Storage  Storage facilities need to be carefully designed to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural process of decomposition  which involves the breakdown of starch  It is crucial that the storage area is dark  well ventilated and for long term storage maintained at temperatures near   For short term storage before cooking  temperatures of about are preferred   On the other hand  temperatures below convert potatoes  starch into sugar  which alters their taste and cooking qualities and leads to higher acrylamide levels in the cooked product  especially in deep fried dishesthe discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods in 2002 has led to many international health concerns as they are believed to be possible carcinogens and their occurrence in cooked foods is currently under study as a possible influence in potential health problems   Under optimum conditions possible in commercial warehouses  potatoes can be stored for up to ten to twelve months  When stored in homes  the shelf life is usually only a few weeks  If potatoes develop green areas or start to sprout  these areas should be trimmed before using  Trimming or peeling green areas are inadequate to remove copresent toxins  and such potatoes are no longer suitable as animal food   Commercial storage of potatoes involves several phases  drying of surface moisture  a wound healing phase at 85% to 95% relative humidity and temperatures below   a staged cooling phase  a holding phase  and a reconditioning phase  during which the tubers are slowly warmed  Mechanical ventilation is used at various points during the process to prevent condensation and accumulation of carbon dioxide   7 2  Yield  The world dedicated 18 6 million hectares in 2010 for potato cultivation  The average world farm yield for potato was 17 4 tonnes per hectare  in 2010  Potato farms in the United States were the most productive in 2010  with a nationwide average of 44 3 tonnes per hectare  United Kingdom was a close second   New Zealand farmers have demonstrated some of the best commercial yields in the world  ranging between 60 to 80 tonnes per hectare  some reporting yields of 88 tonnes potatoes per hectare   There is a big gap among various countries between high and low yields  even with the same variety of potato  Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38–44 tonnes per hectare  China and India accounted for over a third of world s production in 2010  and had yields of 14 7 and 19 9 tonnes per hectare respectively  The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato  or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production  Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed  seed age and quality  crop management practices and the plant environment  Improvements in one or more of these yield determinants  and a closure of the yield gap  can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world   7 3  Varieties  While there are close to 4000 different varieties of potato  it has been bred into many standard or well known varieties  each of which has particular agricultural or culinary attributes  In general  varieties are categorized into a few main groups  such as russets  reds  whites  yellows  also called Yukons  and purples—based on common characteristics  Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK  For culinary purposes  varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness  Floury  or mealy  baking  potatoes have more starch  20–22%  than waxy  boiling  potatoes  16–18%   The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds  amylose and amylopectin  Amylose  a long chain molecule  diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water  and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed  Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content  a highly branched molecule  help the potato retain its shape when boiled   The European Cultivated Potato Database  ECPD  is an online collaborative database of potato variety descriptions  updated and maintained by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency within the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks  ECP GR —which is run by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute  IPGRI    Popular varieties  cultivars  include

slight whitish scab that seems to be present in all samples  The variety  called  Cream of the Crop   has been introduced into Ireland and has proved popular   A mutation in the varieties  P locus causes production of the antioxidant anthocyanin   8  Genetically modified potatoes  Genetic research has produced several genetically modified varieties   New Leaf   owned by Monsanto Company  incorporates genes from Bacillus thuringiensis  which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle   New Leaf Plus  and  New Leaf Y   approved by US regulatory agencies during the 1990s  also include resistance to viruses  McDonald s  Burger King  Frito Lay  and Procter & Gamble announced they would not use genetically modified potatoes  and Monsanto published its intent to discontinue the line in March 2001   Waxy potato varieties produce two main kinds of potato starch  amylose and amylopectin  the latter of which is most industrially useful  The German chemical company BASF created the Amflora potato  which has been modified to contain antisense against the enzyme that drives synthesis of amylose  namely granule bound starch synthase  This resulting potato almost exclusively produces amylopectin  and thus is more useful for the starch industry  In 2010  the European Commission cleared the way for  Amflora  to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only—not for food  Nevertheless  under EU rules  individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory  Commercial planting of  Amflora  was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010  and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years  Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is  Fortuna  which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes  blb1 and blb2  which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum  In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA  In 2012  GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF   In November 2014  the USDA approved a genetically modified potato developed by J R  Simplot Company  which contains genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce less acrylamide when fried than conventional potatoes  the modifications do not cause new proteins to be made  but rather prevent proteins from being made via RNA interference   9  Pests  The historically significant Phytophthora infestans  late blight  remains an ongoing problem in Europe and the United States  Other potato diseases include Rhizoctonia  Sclerotinia  black leg  powdery mildew  powdery scab and leafroll virus   Insects that commonly transmit potato diseases or damage the plants include the Colorado potato beetle  the potato tuber moth  the green peach aphid  Myzus persicae   the potato aphid  beet leafhoppers  thrips  and mites  The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots  thus causing the potato plants to wilt  Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years  crop rotation is recommended   9 1  Pesticides  During the crop year 2008  many of the certified organic potatoes produced in the United Kingdom and certified by the Soil Association as organic were sprayed with a copper pesticide to control potato blight  Phytophthora infestans   According to the Soil Association  the total copper that can be applied to organic land is 6 kg ha year   According to an Environmental Working Group analysis of USDA and FDA pesticide residue tests performed from 2000 through 2008  84% of the 2 216 tested potato samples contained detectable traces of at least one pesticide  A total of 36 unique pesticides were detected on potatoes over the 2 216 samples  though no individual sample contained more than 6 unique pesticide traces  and the average was 1 29 detectable unique pesticide traces per sample  The average quantity of all pesticide traces found in the 2 216 samples was 1 602 ppm  While this was a very low value of pesticide residue  it was the highest amongst the 50 vegetables analyzed   10  Uses  Potatoes are used to brew alcoholic beverages such as vodka  potcheen  or akvavit   They are also used as food for domestic animals   Potato starch is used in the food industry as  for example  thickeners and binders of soups and sauces  in the textile industry  as adhesives  and for the manufacturing of papers and boards   Maine companies are exploring the possibilities of using waste potatoes to obtain polylactic acid for use in plastic products  other research projects seek ways to use the starch as a base for biodegradable packaging   Potato skins  along with honey  are a folk remedy for burns in India  Burn centers in India have experimented with the use of the thin outer skin layer to protect burns while healing   Potatoes  mainly Russets  are commonly used in plant research  The consistent parenchyma tissue  the clonal nature of the plant and the low metabolic activity provide a very nice  model tissue  for experimentation  Wound response studies are often done on potato tuber tissue  as are electron transport experiments  In this respect  potato tuber tissue is similar to Drosophila melanogaster  Caenorhabditis elegans and Escherichia coli  they are all  standard  research organisms   10 1  Culinary uses  Potatoes are prepared in many ways  skin on or peeled  whole or cut up  with seasonings or without  The only requirement involves cooking to swell the starch granules  Most potato dishes are served hot  but some are first cooked  then served cold  notably potato salad and potato chips crisps   Common dishes are  mashed potatoes  which are first boiled  usually peeled   and then mashed with milk or yogurt and butter  whole baked potatoes  boiled or steamed potatoes  French fried potatoes or chips  cut into cubes and roasted  scalloped  diced  or sliced and fried  home fries   grated into small thin strips and fried  hash browns   grated and formed into dumplings  Rösti or potato pancakes  Unlike many foods  potatoes can also be easily cooked in a microwave oven and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value  provided they are covered in ventilated plastic wrap to prevent moisture from escaping  this method produces a meal very similar to a steamed potato  while retaining the appearance of a conventionally baked potato  Potato chunks also commonly appear as a stew ingredient   Potatoes are boiled between 10 and 25 minutes  depending on size and type  to become soft   10 1 1  Grading  In the U S   potato grading for Idaho potatoes is performed in which No  1 potatoes are the highest quality and No  2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance  e g  blemishes or bruises  pointy ends   Potato density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines  High density potatoes are desirable in the production of dehydrated mashed potatoes  potato crisps and french fries   10 1 2  Latin America  Peruvian cuisine naturally contains the potato as a primary ingredient in many dishes  as around 3 000 varieties of this tuber are grown there  Some of the more notable dishes include boiled potato as a base for several dishes or with ají based sauces like in Papa a la Huancaína or ocopa  diced potato for its use in soups like in cau cau  or in Carapulca with dried potato  papa seca   Smashed condimented potato is used in causa Limeña and papa rellena  French fried potatoes are a typical ingredient in Peruvian stir fries  including the classic dish lomo saltado   Chuño is a freeze dried potato product traditionally made by Quechua and Aymara communities of Peru and Bolivia  and is known in various countries of South America  including Peru  Bolivia  Argentina  and Chile  In Chile s Chiloé Archipelago  potatoes are the main ingredient of many dishes  including milcaos  chapaleles  curanto and chochoca  In Ecuador  the potato  as well as being a staple with most dishes  is featured in the hearty locro de papas  a thick soup of potato  squash  and cheese   10 1 3  European cuisine  In the UK  potatoes form part of the traditional staple fish and chips  Roast potatoes are commonly served with a Sunday roast  and mashed potatoes form a major component of several other traditional dishes such as shepherd s pie  bubble and squeak  and bangers and mash  New potatoes are often cooked with mint and served with a little melted butter   The Tattie scone is a popular Scottish dish containing potatoes  Colcannon is
