A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power  It is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit  A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor s terminals changes the current through another pair of terminals  Because the controlled  output  power can be higher than the controlling  input  power  a transistor can amplify a signal  Today  some transistors are packaged individually  but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits   The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices  and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems  Following its development in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen  Walter Brattain  and William Shockley  the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics  and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios  calculators  and computers  among other things  The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics  and the inventors were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement   1  History  The thermionic triode  a vacuum tube invented in 1907  propelled the electronics age forward  enabling amplified radio technology and long distance telephony  The triode  however  was a fragile device that consumed a lot of power  Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field effect transistor  FET  in Canada in 1925  which was intended to be a solid state replacement for the triode  Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928  However  Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype  Because the production of high quality semiconductor materials was still decades away  Lilienfeld s solid state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s  even if such a device had been built  In 1934  German inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device  From November 17  1947 to December 23  1947  John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&T s Bell Labs in the United States  performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium  a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input  Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this  and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors  The term transistor was coined by John R  Pierce as a portmanteau of the term transresistance  According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch  authors of a biography of John Bardeen  Shockley had proposed that Bell Labs  first patent for a transistor should be based on the field effect and that he be named as the inventor  Having unearthed Lilienfeld’s patents that went into obscurity years earlier  lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley s proposal because the idea of a field effect transistor that used an electric field as a  grid  was not new  Instead  what Bardeen  Brattain  and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point contact transistor  In acknowledgement of this accomplishment  Shockley  Bardeen  and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics  for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect    In 1948  the point contact transistor was independently invented by German physicists Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker while working at the Compagnie des Freins et Signaux  a Westinghouse subsidiary located in Paris  Mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the German radar effort during World War II  Using this knowledge  he began researching the phenomenon of  interference  in 1947  By June 1948  witnessing currents flowing through point contacts  Mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker  similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947  Realizing that Bell Labs  scientists had already invented the transistor before them  the company rushed to get its  transistron  into production for amplified use in France s telephone network   The first high frequency transistor was the surface barrier germanium transistor developed by Philco in 1953  capable of operating up to   These were made by etching depressions into an N type germanium base from both sides with jets of Indium III  sulfate until it was a few ten thousandths of an inch thick  Indium electroplated into the depressions formed the collector and emitter  The first all transistor car radio  which was produced in 1955 by Chrysler and Philco  used these transistors in its circuitry and also they were the first suitable for high speed computers   The first working silicon transistor was developed at Bell Labs on January 26  1954 by Morris Tanenbaum  The first commercial silicon transistor was produced by Texas Instruments in 1954  This was the work of Gordon Teal  an expert in growing crystals of high purity  who had previously worked at Bell Labs  The first MOS transistor actually built was by Kahng and Atalla at Bell Labs in 1960   2  Importance  The transistor is the key active component in practically all modern electronics  Many consider it to be one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century  Its importance in today s society rests on its ability to be mass produced using a highly automated process  semiconductor device fabrication  that achieves astonishingly low per transistor costs  The invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009   Although several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged  known as discrete  transistors every year  the vast majority of transistors are now produced in integrated circuits  often shortened to IC  microchips or simply chips   along with diodes  resistors  capacitors and other electronic components  to produce complete electronic circuits  A logic gate consists of up to about twenty transistors whereas an advanced microprocessor  as of 2009  can use as many as 3 billion transistors  MOSFETs    About 60 million transistors were built in 2002     for  each  man  woman  and child on Earth    The transistor s low cost  flexibility  and reliability have made it a ubiquitous device  Transistorized mechatronic circuits have replaced electromechanical devices in controlling appliances and machinery  It is often easier and cheaper to use a standard microcontroller and write a computer program to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical control function   3  Simplified operation  The essential usefulness of a transistor comes from its ability to use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals  This property is called gain  It can produce a stronger output signal  a voltage or current  that is proportional to a weaker input signal  that is  it can act as an amplifier  Alternatively  the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled switch  where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements   There are two types of transistors  which have slight differences in how they are used in a circuit  A bipolar transistor has terminals labeled base  collector  and emitter  A small current at the base terminal  that is  flowing between the base and the emitter  can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals  For a field effect transistor  the terminals are labeled gate  source  and drain  and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain   The image to the right represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit  Charge will flow between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base  Because internally the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode  a voltage drop develops between base and emitter while the base current exists  The amount of this voltage depends on the material the transistor is made from  and is referred to as VBE   3 1  Transistor as a switch  Transistors are commonly used as electronic switches  both for high power applications such as switched mode power supplies and for low power applications such as logic gates   In a grounded emitter transistor circuit  such as the light switch circuit shown  as the base voltage rises  the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially  The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter  If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero  or near zero   the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance  light bulb  and the supply voltage  This is called saturation because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely  When saturated  the switch is said to be on   Providing sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches  The transistor provides current gain  allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal  The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor  and even for a particular type  varies depending on the collector current  In the example light switch circuit shown  the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated   In any switching circuit  values of input voltage would be chosen such that the output is either completely off  or completely on  The transistor is acting as a switch  and this type of operation is common in digital circuits where only  on  and  off  values are relevant   3 2  Transistor as an amplifier  The common emitter amplifier is designed so that a small change in voltage  Vin  changes the small current through the base of the transistor  the transistor s current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit mean that small swings in Vin produce large changes in Vout   Various configurations of single transistor amplifier are possible  with some providing current gain  some voltage gain  and some both   From mobile phones to televisions  vast numbers of products include amplifiers for sound reproduction  radio transmission  and signal processing  The first discrete transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts  but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved   Modern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred watts are common and relatively inexpensive   4  Comparison with vacuum tubes  Prior to the development of transistors  vacuum  electron  tubes  or in the UK  thermionic valves  or just  valves   were the main active components in electronic equipment   4 1  Advantages  The key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace their vacuum tube predecessors in most applications are  No power consumption by a cathode heater  the characteristic orange glow of vacuum tubes is due to a simple electrical heating element  much like a light bulb filament   Small size and minimal weight  allowing the development of miniaturized electronic devices   Low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells   No warm up period for cathode heaters required after power application   Lower power dissipation and generally greater energy efficiency   Higher reliability and greater physical ruggedness   Extremely long life  Some transistorized devices have been in service for more than 50 years   Complementary devices available  facilitating the design of complementary symmetry circuits  something not possible with vacuum tubes   Greatly reduced sensitivity to mechanical shock and vibration  thus reducing the problem of microphonics in sensitive applications  such as audio   4 2  Limitations  Silicon transistors can age and fail   High power  high frequency operation  such as that used in over the air television broadcasting  is better achieved in vacuum tubes due to improved electron mobility in a vacuum   Solid state devices are more vulnerable to electrostatic discharge in handling and operation  A vacuum tube momentarily overloaded will just get a little hotter  solid state devices have less mass to absorb the heat due to overloads  in proportion to their rating  Sensitivity to radiation and cosmic rays  special radiation hardened chips are used for spacecraft devices    Vacuum tubes create a distortion  the so called tube sound  that some people find to be more tolerable to the ear   5  Types     style  text align center      PNP    P channel    style  text align center      NPN    N channel    style  text align center    BJT    JFET       style

and minority carriers  The bipolar junction transistor  the first type of transistor to be mass produced  is a combination of two junction diodes  and is formed of either a thin layer of p type semiconductor sandwiched between two n type semiconductors  an n–p–n transistor   or a thin layer of n type semiconductor sandwiched between two p type semiconductors  a p–n–p transistor   This construction produces two p–n junctions  a base–emitter junction and a base–collector junction  separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region  two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor    BJTs have three terminals  corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor—an emitter  a base  and a collector  They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current   In an n–p–n transistor operating in the active region  the emitter–base junction is forward biased  electrons and holes recombine at the junction   and electrons are injected into the base region  Because the base is narrow  most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse biased  electrons and holes are formed at  and move away from the junction  base–collector junction and be swept into the collector  perhaps one hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base  which is the dominant mechanism in the base current  By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base  the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled  Collector current is approximately β  common emitter current gain  times the base current  It is typically greater than 100 for small signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high power applications   Unlike the field effect transistor  see below   the BJT is a low–input impedance device  Also  as the base–emitter voltage  Vbe  is increased the base–emitter current and hence the collector–emitter current  Ice  increase exponentially according to the Shockley diode model and the Ebers Moll model  Because of this exponential relationship  the BJT has a higher transconductance than the FET   Bipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light  because absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current  the collector current is approximately β times the photocurrent  Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called phototransistors   5 2  Field effect transistor  FET   The field effect transistor  sometimes called a unipolar transistor  uses either electrons  in n channel FET  or holes  in p channel FET  for conduction  The four terminals of the FET are named source  gate  drain  and body  substrate   On most FETs  the body is connected to the source inside the package  and this will be assumed for the following description   In a FET  the drain to source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the source region to the drain region  The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals  hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source  As the gate–source voltage  Vgs  is increased  the drain–source current  Ids  increases exponentially for Vgs below threshold  and then at a roughly quadratic rate     where VT is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins  in the  space charge limited  region above threshold  A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices  for example  at the 65 nm technology node   For low noise at narrow bandwidth the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous   FETs are divided into two families  junction FET  JFET  and insulated gate FET  IGFET   The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal–oxide–semiconductor FET  MOSFET   reflecting its original construction from layers of metal  the gate   oxide  the insulation   and semiconductor  Unlike IGFETs  the JFET gate forms a p–n diode with the channel which lies between the source and drain  Functionally  this makes the n channel JFET the solid state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which  similarly  forms a diode between its grid and cathode  Also  both devices operate in the depletion mode  they both have a high input impedance  and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage   Metal–semiconductor FETs  MESFETs  are JFETs in which the reverse biased p–n junction is replaced by a metal–semiconductor junction  These  and the HEMTs  high electron mobility transistors  or HFETs   in which a two dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport  are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies  microwave frequencies  several GHz    FETs are further divided into depletion mode and enhancement mode types  depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate to source voltage  For enhancement mode  the channel is off at zero bias  and a gate potential can  enhance  the conduction  For the depletion mode  the channel is on at zero bias  and a gate potential  of the opposite polarity  can  deplete  the channel  reducing conduction  For either mode  a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n channel devices and a lower current for p channel devices  Nearly all JFETs are depletion mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement mode devices  most IGFETs are enhancement mode types   5 3  Usage of bipolar and field effect transistors  The bipolar junction transistor  BJT  was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s  Even after MOSFETs became widely available  the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity and ease of manufacture  In integrated circuits  the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits  Discrete MOSFETs can be applied in transistor applications  including analog circuits  voltage regulators  amplifiers  power transmitters and motor drivers   5 4  Other transistor types  Bipolar junction transistor  Heterojunction bipolar transistor  up to several hundred GHz  common in modern ultrafast and RF circuits  Schottky transistor  Avalanche transistor  Darlington transistors are two BJTs connected together to provide a high current gain equal to the product of the current gains of the two transistors   Insulated gate bipolar transistors  IGBTs  use a medium power IGFET  similarly connected to a power BJT  to give a high input impedance  Power diodes are often connected between certain terminals depending on specific use  IGBTs are particularly suitable for heavy duty industrial applications  The Asea Brown Boveri  ABB  5SNA2400E170100 illustrates just how far power semiconductor technology has advanced  Intended for three phase power supplies  this device houses three n–p–n IGBTs in a case measuring 38 by 140 by 190 mm and weighing 1 5 kg  Each IGBT is rated at 1 700 volts and can handle 2 400 amperes   Photo transistor  Multiple emitter transistor  used in transistor–transistor logic  Multiple base transistor  used to amplify very low level signals in noisy environments such as the pickup of a record player or radio front ends  Effectively  it is a very large number of transistors in parallel where  at the output  the signal is added constructively  but random noise is added only stochastically   Field effect transistor  Carbon nanotube field effect transistor  CNFET   JFET  where the gate is insulated by a reverse biased p–n junction  MESFET  similar to JFET with a Schottky junction instead of a p–n junction  High electron mobility transistor  HEMT  HFET

Floating gate transistor  for non volatile storage   FETs used to sense environment  Ion sensitive field effect transistor  IFSET   to measure ion concentrations in solution   EOSFET  electrolyte oxide semiconductor field effect transistor  Neurochip   DNAFET  deoxyribonucleic acid field effect transistor  Diffusion transistor  formed by diffusing dopants into semiconductor substrate  can be both BJT and FET  Unijunction transistors can be used as simple pulse generators  They comprise a main body of either P type or N type semiconductor with ohmic contacts at each end  terminals Base1 and Base2   A junction with the opposite semiconductor type is formed at a point along the length of the body for the third terminal  Emitter    Single electron transistors  SET  consist of a gate island between two tunneling junctions  The tunneling current is controlled by a voltage applied to the gate through a capacitor   Nanofluidic transistor  controls the movement of ions through sub microscopic  water filled channels   Multigate devices  Tetrode transistor  Pentode transistor  Trigate transistors  Prototype by Intel   Dual gate FETs have a single channel with two gates in cascode  a configuration optimized for high frequency amplifiers  mixers  and oscillators   Junctionless nanowire transistor  JNT   developed at Tyndall National Institute in Ireland  was the first transistor successfully fabricated without junctions   Even MOSFETs have junctions  although its gate is electrically insulated from the region the gate controls   Junctions are difficult and expensive to fabricate  and  because they are a significant source of current leakage  they waste significant power and generate significant waste heat  Eliminating them held the promise of cheaper and denser microchips  The JNT uses a simple nanowire of silicon surrounded by an electrically isolated  wedding ring  that acts to gate the flow of electrons through the wire  This method has been described as akin to squeezing a garden hose to gate the flow of water through the hose  The nanowire is heavily n doped  making it an excellent conductor  Crucially the gate  comprising silicon  is heavily p doped  and its presence depletes the underlying silicon nanowire thereby preventing carrier flow past the gate   Vacuum channel transistor  In 2012  NASA and the National Nanofab Center in South Korea were reported to have built a prototype vacuum channel transistor in only 150 nanometers in size  can be manufactured cheaply using standard silicon semiconductor processing  can operate at high speeds even in hostile environments  and could consume just as much power as a standard transistor   6  Part numbering standards   specifications  The types of some transistors can be parsed from the part number  There are three major semiconductor naming standards  in each the alphanumeric prefix provides clues to type of the device   6 1  Japanese Industrial Standard  JIS   The JIS C 7012 specification for transistor part numbers starts with  2S   e g  2SD965  but sometimes the  2S  prefix is not marked on the package – a 2SD965 might only be marked  D965   a 2SC1815 might be listed by a supplier as simply  C1815   This series sometimes has suffixes  such as  R    O    BL     standing for  Red    Orange    Blue  etc   to denote variants  such as tighter hFE  gain  groupings   6 2  European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association  EECA   The Pro Electron standard  the European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association part numbering scheme  begins with two letters  the first gives the semiconductor type  A for germanium  B for silicon  and C for materials like GaAs   the second letter denotes the intended use  A for diode  C for general purpose transistor  etc    A 3 digit sequence number  or one letter then 2 digits  for industrial types  follows  With early devices this indicated the case type  Suffixes may be used  with a letter  e g   C  often means high hFE  such as in  BC549C  or other codes may follow to show gain  e g  BC327 25  or voltage rating  e g  BUK854 800A   The more common prefixes are   6 3  Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council  JEDEC   The JEDEC EIA370 transistor device numbers usually start with  2N   indicating a three terminal device  dual gate field effect transistors are four terminal devices  so begin with 3N   then a 2  3 or 4 digit sequential number with no significance as to device properties  although early devices with low numbers tend to be germanium   For example 2N3055 is a silicon n–p–n power transistor  2N1301 is a p–n–p germanium switching transistor  A letter suffix  such as  A   is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant  but rarely gain groupings   6 4  Proprietary  Manufacturers of devices may have their own proprietary numbering system  for example CK722  Since devices are second sourced  a manufacturer s prefix  like  MPF  in MPF102  which originally would denote a Motorola FET  now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device  Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes  for example a PN2222A is a  possibly Fairchild Semiconductor  2N2222A in a plastic case  but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108  not a 2N108  while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices    Military part numbers sometimes are assigned their own codes  such as the British Military CV Naming System   Manufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with  house numbers   identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number  For example  an HP part 1854 0053 is a  JEDEC  2N2218 transistor which is also assigned the CV number  CV7763  6 5  Naming problems  With so many independent naming schemes  and the abbreviation of part numbers when printed on the devices  ambiguity sometimes occurs  For example two different devices may be marked  J176   one the J176 low power Junction FET  the other the higher powered MOSFET 2SJ176    As older  through hole  transistors are given surface mount packaged counterparts  they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their own systems to cope with the variety in pinout arrangements and options for dual or matched n–p–n+p–n–p devices in one pack  So even when the original device  such as a 2N3904  may have been assigned by a standards authority  and well known by engineers over the years  the new versions are far from standardized in their naming   7  Construction  7 1  Semiconductor material  The first BJTs were made from germanium  Ge   Silicon  Si  types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high performance versions now employ the compound semiconductor material gallium arsenide  GaAs  and the semiconductor alloy silicon germanium  SiGe   Single element semiconductor material  Ge and Si  is described as elemental   Rough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the table to the right  these parameters will vary with increase in temperature  electric field  impurity level  strain  and sundry other factors   The junction forward voltage is the voltage applied to the emitter–base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current  The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased  The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA  the same values apply to semiconductor diodes   The lower the junction forward voltage the better  as this means that less power is required to  drive  the transistor  The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature  For a typical silicon junction the change is −2 1 mV °C  In some circuits special compensating elements  sensistors  must be used to compensate for such changes   The density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel  Some impurities  called dopants  are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET  to control the MOSFET electrical behavior   The electron mobility and hole mobility columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an electric field of 1 volt per meter applied across the material  In general  the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate  The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect  However  Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide   Its maximum temperature is limited   it has relatively high leakage current   it cannot withstand high voltages   it is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits  Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials  a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor  GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors  It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high frequency applications  A relatively recent FET development  the high electron mobility transistor  HEMT   has a heterostructure  junction between different semiconductor materials  of aluminium gallium arsenide  AlGaAs  gallium arsenide  GaAs  which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs metal barrier junction  Because of their high speed and low noise  HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz  HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride  AlGaN GaN HEMTs  provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications   Max  junction temperature values represent a cross section taken from various manufacturers  data sheets  This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged   Al–Si junction refers to the high speed  aluminum–silicon  metal–semiconductor barrier diode  commonly known as a Schottky diode  This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a parasitic reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process  This diode can be a nuisance  but sometimes it is used in the circuit   7 2  Packaging  Discrete transistors are individually packaged transistors  Transistors come in many different semiconductor packages  see image   The two main categories are through hole  or leaded   and surface mount  also known as surface mount device  SMD   The ball grid array  BGA  is the latest surface mount package  currently only for large integrated circuits   It has solder  balls  on the underside in place of leads  Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections  SMDs have better high frequency characteristics but lower power rating   Transistor packages are made of glass  metal  ceramic  or plastic  The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics  Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to heat sinks for enhanced cooling  Additionally  most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure  At the other extreme  some surface mount microwave transistors are as small as grains of sand   Often a given transistor type is available in several packages  Transistor packages are mainly standardized  but the assignment of a transistor s functions to the terminals is not  other transistor types can assign other functions to the package s terminals  Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary  normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number  q e  BC212L and BC212K    Nowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages  in comparison the list of available through hole packages is relatively small  here is a short list of the most common through hole transistors packages in alphabetical order  ATV  E line  MRT  HRT  SC 43  SC 72  TO 3  TO 18  TO 39  TO 92  TO 126  TO220  TO247  TO251  TO262  ZTX851  7 2 1  Flexible transistors
