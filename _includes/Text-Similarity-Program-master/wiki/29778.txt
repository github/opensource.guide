Thomas Alva Edison  February 11  1847 – October 18  1931  was an American inventor and businessman  He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world  including the phonograph  the motion picture camera  and a long lasting  practical electric light bulb  Dubbed  The Wizard of Menlo Park   he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large scale teamwork to the process of invention  and because of that  he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory   Edison was a prolific inventor  holding 1 093 US patents in his name  as well as many patents in the United Kingdom  France  and Germany  More significant than the number of Edison s patents was the widespread impact of his inventions  electric light and power utilities  sound recording  and motion pictures all established major new industries world wide  Edison s inventions contributed to mass communication and  in particular  telecommunications  These included a stock ticker  a mechanical vote recorder  a battery for an electric car  electrical power  recorded music and motion pictures   His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator  Edison developed a system of electric power generation and distribution to homes  businesses  and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world  His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan  New York   1  Early life  Thomas Edison was born in Milan  Ohio  and grew up in Port Huron  Michigan  He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison  Jr   1804–1896  born in Marshalltown  Nova Scotia  Canada  and Nancy Matthews Elliott  1810–1871  born in Chenango County  New York   His father had to escape from Canada because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837  Edison reported being of Dutch ancestry   In school  the young Edison s mind often wandered  and his teacher  the Reverend Engle  was overheard calling him  addled   This ended Edison s three months of official schooling  Edison recalled later   My mother was the making of me  She was so true  so sure of me  and I felt I had something to live for  someone I must not disappoint   His mother taught him at home  Much of his education came from reading R G  Parker s School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union   Edison developed hearing problems at an early age  The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle ear infections  Around the middle of his career  Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek  Michigan  along with his apparatus and chemicals  In his later years  he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor  in helping him onto a moving train  lifted him by the ears   Edison s family moved to Port Huron  Michigan  after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and business declined  his life there was bittersweet  Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit  and sold vegetables to supplement his income  He also studied qualitative analysis  and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind   Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road  and  with the aid of four assistants  he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald  which he sold with his other papers  This began Edison s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures  as he discovered his talents as a businessman  These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies  including General Electric  which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world   2  Telegrapher  Edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three year old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train  Jimmie s father  station agent J U  MacKenzie of Mount Clemens  Michigan  was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator  Edison s first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction  Ontario  on the Grand Trunk Railway   In 1866  at the age of 19  Edison moved to Louisville  Kentucky  where  as an employee of Western Union  he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire  Edison requested the night shift  which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting  Eventually  the latter pre occupation cost him his job  One night in 1867  he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor  It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss s desk below  The next morning Edison was fired   One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope  who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth  New Jersey  home  Some of Edison s earliest inventions were related to telegraphy  including a stock ticker  His first patent was for the electric vote recorder   U S  Patent 90 646   which was granted on June 1  1869   3  Marriages and children  On December 25  1871  Edison married 16 year old Mary Stilwell  1855–1884   whom he had met two months earlier  she was an employee at one of his shops  They had three children   Marion Estelle Edison  1873–1965   nicknamed  Dot   Thomas Alva Edison  Jr   1876–1935   nicknamed  Dash   William Leslie Edison  1878–1937  Inventor  graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale  1900  Mary Edison died at age 29 on August 9  1884  of unknown causes  possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose  Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes  and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning  On February 24  1886  at the age of thirty nine  Edison married the 20 year old Mina Miller  1866–1947  in Akron  Ohio  She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller  co founder of the Chautauqua Institution and a benefactor of Methodist charities  They also had three children together   Madeleine Edison  1888–1979   who married John Eyre Sloane   Charles Edison  1890–1969   Governor of New Jersey  1941 – 1944   and took over his father s company and experimental laboratories upon his father s death   Theodore Edison  1898–1992    MIT Physics 1923   credited with more than 80 patents  Mina outlived Thomas Edison  dying on August 24  1947   4  Beginning his career  Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark  New Jersey  with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices  but the invention that first gained him notice was the phonograph in 1877  This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical  Edison became known as  The Wizard of Menlo Park   New Jersey   His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder  Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times  the phonograph made Edison a celebrity  Joseph Henry  president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US  described Edison as  the most ingenious inventor in this country    or in any other   In April 1878  Edison travelled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences  Congressmen  Senators and US President Hayes  The Washington Post described Edison as a  genius  and his presentation as  a scene    that will live in history   Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878  he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell  Chichester Bell  and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph like device in the 1880s that used wax coated cardboard cylinders   5  Menlo Park  Edison s major innovation was the first industrial research lab  which was built in Menlo Park  a part of Raritan Township  Middlesex County  New Jersey  today named Edison in his honor   It was built with the funds from the sale of Edison s quadruplex telegraph  After his demonstration of the telegraph  Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4 000 to $5 000 was right  so he asked Western Union to make a bid  He was surprised to hear them offer $10 000  $ in today s dollars    which he gratefully accepted  The quadruplex telegraph was Edison s first big financial success  and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement  Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there  though many employees carried out research and development under his direction  His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research  and he drove them hard to produce results   William Joseph Hammer  a consulting electrical engineer  began his duties as a laboratory assistant to Edison in December 1879  He assisted in experiments on the telephone  phonograph  electric railway  iron ore separator  electric lighting  and other developing inventions  However  Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device  In 1880  he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works  In his first year  the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50 000 lamps  According to Edison  Hammer was  a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting   Frank J  Sprague  a competent mathematician and former naval officer  was recruited by Edward H  Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883  One of Sprague s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison s mathematical methods  Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics  analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton  for example  determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm s Law  Joule s Law and economics   Nearly all of Edison s patents were utility patents  which were protected for a 17 year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical  mechanical  or chemical in nature  About a dozen were design patents  which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14 year period  As in most patents  the inventions he described were improvements over prior art  The phonograph patent  in contrast  was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds   In just over a decade  Edison s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks  Edison said he wanted the lab to have  a stock of almost every conceivable material   A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim  stating the lab contained  eight thousand kinds of chemicals  every kind of screw made  every size of needle  every kind of cord or wire  hair of humans  horses  hogs  cows  rabbits  goats  minx  camels     silk in every texture  cocoons  various kinds of hoofs  shark s teeth  deer horns  tortoise shell     cork  resin  varnish and oil  ostrich feathers  a peacock s tail  jet  amber  rubber  all ores      and the list goes on   Over his desk  Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds  famous quotation   There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking   This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility   With Menlo Park  Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application   5 1  Carbon telephone transmitter  In 1877–78  Edison invented and developed the carbon microphone used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s  After protracted patent litigation  in 1892 a federal court ruled that Edison and not Emile Berliner was the inventor of the carbon microphone  The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s   5 2  Electric light  Edison did not invent the first electric light bulb  but instead invented the first commercially practical incandescent light  Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps  including Alessandro Volta s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans  Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy  James Bowman Lindsay  Moses G  Farmer  William E  Sawyer  Joseph Swan and Heinrich Göbel  Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life  high expense to produce  and high electric current drawn  making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially   After many experiments  first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals  in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament  The first successful test was on October 22  1879  it lasted 13 5 hours  Edison continued to improve this design and by November 4  1879  filed for U S  patent 223 898  granted on January 27  1880  for an electric lamp using  a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires    Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including  cotton and linen thread  wood splints  papers coiled in various ways   it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1 200 hours  The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison s recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present day state of Wyoming  where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29  1878  from the Continental Divide   In 1878  Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers  including J  P  Morgan and the members of the Vanderbilt family  Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31  1879  in Menlo Park  It was during this time that he said   We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles    Henry Villard  president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company  had attended Edison s 1879 demonstration  Villard quickly became impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard his company s new steamer  the Columbia  Although hesitant at first  Edison relented and agreed to Villard s request  Following most of its completion in May 1880  the Columbia was sent to New York City  where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia s new lighting system  Due to this  the Columbia became Edison s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb  The Edison equipment was eventually removed from Columbia in 1895   Lewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884  Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the  Process of Manufacturing Carbons   an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for lightbulbs  Latimer worked as an engineer  a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights   George Westinghouse s company bought Philip Diehl s competing induction lamp patent rights  1882  for $25 000  forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp   On October 8  1883  the US patent office ruled that Edison s patent was based on the work of William Sawyer and was therefore invalid  Litigation continued for nearly six years  until October 6  1889  when a judge ruled that Edison s electric light improvement claim for  a filament of carbon of high resistance  was valid  To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan  whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison s  he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain   Mahen Theatre in Brno  in what is now the Czech Republic   which opened in 1882  was the first public building in the world to use Edison s electric lamps  with the installation supervised by Edison s assistant in the invention of the lamp  Francis Jehl  In September 2010  a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno  in front of the theatre   6  Electric power distribution  After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21  1879  Edison patented a system for electricity distribution in 1880  which was essential to capitalize on the invention of the electric lamp  On December 17  1880  Edison founded the Edison Illuminating Company  The company established the first investor owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station  New York City  It was on September 4  1882  that Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station s electrical power distribution system  which provided 110 volts direct current  DC  to 59 customers in lower Manhattan   Earlier in the year  in January 1882  he had switched on the first steam generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London  The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station  On January 19  1883  the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle  New Jersey   Nikola Tesla worked for Edison for two years at the Continental Edison Company in France starting in 1882  and another year at the Edison Machine Works in New York City ending in a disagreement over pay   6 1  War of currents  Edison s true success  like that of his friend Henry Ford  was in his ability to maximize profits through establishment of mass production systems and intellectual property rights  George Westinghouse and Edison became adversaries because of Edison s promotion of direct current  DC  for electric power distribution instead of the more easily transmitted alternating current  AC  system promoted by Westinghouse  Unlike DC  AC could be stepped up to very high voltages with transformers  sent over thinner and cheaper wires  and stepped down again at the destination for distribution to users   In 1887  there were 121 Edison power stations in the United States delivering DC electricity to customers  When the limitations of DC were discussed by the public  Edison launched a propaganda campaign to convince people that AC was far too dangerous to use  The problem with DC was that the power plants could economically deliver DC electricity only to customers within about one and a half miles  about 2 4 km  from the generating station  so that it was suitable only for central business districts  When George Westinghouse suggested using high voltage AC instead  as it could carry electricity hundreds of miles with marginal loss of power  Edison waged a  War of Currents  to prevent AC from being adopted   The war against AC led him to become involved in the development and promotion of the electric chair  using AC  as an attempt to portray AC to have greater lethal potential than DC  Edison went on to carry out a brief but intense campaign to ban the use of AC or to limit the allowable voltage for safety purposes  As part of this campaign  Edison s employees publicly electrocuted stray or unwanted animals to demonstrate the dangers of AC  alternating electric currents are slightly more dangerous in that frequencies near 60 Hz have a markedly greater potential for inducing fatal  cardiac fibrillation  than do direct currents   AC replaced DC in most instances of generation and power distribution  enormously extending the range and improving the efficiency of power distribution  Though widespread use of DC ultimately lost favor for distribution  it exists today primarily in long distance high voltage direct current  HVDC  transmission systems  Low voltage DC distribution continued to be used in high density downtown areas for many years but was eventually replaced by AC low voltage network distribution in many of them   DC had the advantage that large battery banks could maintain continuous power through brief interruptions of the electric supply from generators and the transmission system  Utilities such as Commonwealth Edison in Chicago had rotary converters or motor generator sets  which could change DC to AC and AC to various frequencies in the early to mid 20th century  Utilities supplied rectifiers to convert the low voltage AC to DC for such DC loads as elevators  fans and pumps  There were still 1 600 DC customers in downtown New York City as of 2005  and service was finally discontinued only on November 14  2007  Most subway systems are still powered by direct current   7  Other inventions and projects  7 1  Fluoroscopy  Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope  a machine that uses X rays to take radiographs  Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen  the technology was capable of producing only very faint images   The fundamental design of Edison s fluoroscope is still in use today  although Edison himself abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant  Clarence Dally  Dally had made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation  He later died of injuries related to the exposure  In 1903  a shaken Edison said  Don t talk to me about X rays  I am afraid of them    7 2  Telegraph improvements  The key to Edison s fortunes was telegraphy  With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator  he learned the basics of electricity  This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker  the first electricity based broadcast system  On August 9  1892  Edison received a patent for a two way telegraph   7 3  Motion pictures  Edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or  Kinetograph   He did the electromechanical design  while his employee W K L  Dickson  a photographer  worked on the photographic and optical development  Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson  In 1891  Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope  or peep hole viewer  This device was installed in penny arcades  where people could watch short  simple films  The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20  1891   In April 1896  Thomas Armat s Vitascope  manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison s name  was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City  Later he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings  mechanically synchronized with the film   Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T  Bush  1869–1948  bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z  Maguire and Joseph D  Baucus a dozen machines  Bush placed from October 17  1894  the first kinetoscopes in London  At the same time the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France  In the last three months of 1894  The Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe  i e  the Netherlands and Italy   In Germany and in Austria Hungary the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche österreichische Edison Kinetoscop Gesellschaft  founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne   The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895  The Edison s Kinétoscope Français  a Belgian company  was founded in Brussels on January 15  1895  with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco  France and the French colonies  The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists   On May 14  1895  the Edison s Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels  The businessman Ladislas Victor Lewitzki  living in London but active in Belgium and France  took the initiative in starting this business  He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co  In 1898 he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France   Edison s film studio made close to 1 200 films  The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott s Sneeze  1894   The Kiss  1896   The Great Train Robbery  1903   Alice s Adventures in Wonderland  1910   and the first Frankenstein film in 1910  In 1903  when the owners of Luna Park  Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation  poisoning  and electrocution  with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant   Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it  releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant   As the film business expanded competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other s films  To better protect the copyrights on his films  Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U S  copyright office  Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era   In 1908  Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company  which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios  commonly known as the Edison Trust   Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America  which was founded in 1929   Edison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation  He thought that talkies had  spoiled everything  for him   There isn t any good acting on the screen  They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act  I can sense it more than you because I am deaf   His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow   7 4  Mining  In 1901  Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario  Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment  He returned as a mining prospector  and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body  His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful  however  and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903  A street in Falconbridge  as well as the Edison Building  which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines  are named for him   8  West Orange and Fort Myers  1886–1931   Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife  Mary  in 1884  and purchased a home known as  Glenmont  in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife  Mina  in Llewellyn Park in West Orange  New Jersey  In 1885  Thomas Edison had bought property in Fort Myers  Florida  and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat  Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers  and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber   Henry Ford  the automobile magnate  later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers  Florida  Edison even contributed technology to the automobile  They were friends until Edison s death   In 1928  Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club  He believed strongly in the organization  writing that  The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community  state  and nation  and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks   He was an active member in the club until his death  sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club s meetings   9  Final years and death  Edison was active in business right up to the end  Just months before his death  the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair  Dover  and Gladstone  New Jersey  Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current  which Edison had championed  Despite his frail condition  Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU  Multiple Unit  train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930  driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange   This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984  A plaque commemorating Edison s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken  which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit   Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years   the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours   He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health  However  this tale is doubtful  In 1930  the year before Edison died  Mina said in an interview about him   correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies   She also said that during one of his periodic  great scientific adventures   Edison would be up at 7 00  have breakfast at 8 00  and be rarely home for lunch or dinner  implying that he continued to have all three   Edison became the owner of his Milan  Ohio  birthplace in 1906  On his last visit  in 1923  he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles   10  Death  Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18  1931  in his home   Glenmont  in Llewellyn Park in West Orange  New Jersey  which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina  He is buried behind the home   Edison s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the Henry Ford Museum  Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor s room shortly after his death  as a memento  A plaster death mask was also made  Mina died in 1947   11  Views on politics  religion and metaphysics  Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a  freethinker   Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine s The Age of Reason  Edison defended Paine s  scientific deism   saying   He has been called an atheist  but atheist he was not  Paine believed in a supreme intelligence  as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity   In an October 2  1910  interview in the New York Times Magazine  Edison stated   Nature is what we know  We do not know the gods of religions  And nature is not kind  or merciful  or loving  If God made me — the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke  mercy  kindness  love — He also made the fish I catch and eat  And where do His mercy  kindness  and love for that fish come in  No  nature made us — nature did it all — not the gods of the religions  Edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks  and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly  he clarified himself in a private letter  You have misunderstood the whole article  because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God  There is no such denial  what you call God I call Nature  the Supreme intelligence that rules matter  All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came  scattered amongst the cells of which we are made  He also stated   I do not believe in the God of the theologians  but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt    Nonviolence was key to Edison s moral views  and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I  he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted   I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill   Edison s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well  about which he stated   Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics  which is the goal of all evolution  Until we stop harming all other living beings  we are still savages   However  he is also notorious for having electrocuted a number of dogs in 1888  both by direct and alternating current  in an attempt to argue that the former  which he had a vested business interest in promoting  was safer than the latter  favored by his rival George Westinghouse    Edison s success in promoting direct current as less lethal also led to alternating current being used in the electric chair adopted by New York in 1889 as a supposedly humane execution method  Because Westinghouse was angered by the decision  he funded Eighth Amendment based appeals for inmates set to die in the electric chair  ultimately resulting in Edison providing the generators which powered early electrocutions and testifying successfully on behalf of the state that electrocution was a painless method of execution   In 1920  Edison set off a media sensation when he told B  C  Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a  spirit phone  to allow communication with the dead  a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated  Edison later disclaimed the idea  telling the New York Times in 1926 that  I really had nothing to tell him  but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits  but it was all a joke    12  Views on money  Thomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States  He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt based money  Famously  he was quoted in the New York Times stating  Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar  and interest is an invention of Satan    In the same article  he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States  in need of a loan  be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal  or even greater sums  due to interest  His basic point was that if the Government can produce debt based money  it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer   He thought at length about the subject of money over 1921 and 1922  In May 1922  he published a proposal  entitled  A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System   In it  he detailed an explanation of a commodity backed currency  in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest free currency to farmers  based on the value of commodities they produced  During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor  Henry Ford  he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform  For insight  he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals  In the end  however  Edison s proposals failed to find support  and were eventually abandoned   13  Awards  The President of the Third French Republic  Jules Grévy  on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs Jules Barthélemy Saint Hilaire and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Louis Cochery  designated Edison with the distinction of an  Officer of the Legion of Honour   Légion d honneur  by decree on November 10  1881
