In optics the refractive index or index of refraction n of an optical medium is a dimensionless number that describes how light  or any other radiation  propagates through that medium  It is defined as  where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the speed of light in the substance  For example  the refractive index of water is 1 33  meaning that light travels 1 33 times faster in a vacuum than it does in water   The refractive index determines how much light is bent  or refracted  when entering a material  This is the historically first use of refractive indices and is described by Snell s law of refraction    where and are the angles of incidence and refraction  respectively  of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices and   The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface  as well as the critical angle for total internal reflection and Brewster s angle   The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values  the speed of light in a medium is   and similarly the wavelength in that medium is   where is the wavelength of that light in vacuum  This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1  and that the frequency    of the wave is not affected by the refractive index   The refractive index varies with the wavelength of light  This is called dispersion and causes the splitting of white light into its constituent colors in prisms and rainbows  and chromatic aberration in lenses  Light propagation in absorbing materials can be described using a complex valued refractive index  The imaginary part then handles the attenuation  while the real part accounts for refraction   The concept of refractive index is widely used within the full electromagnetic spectrum  from x rays to radio waves  It can also be used with wave phenomena such as sound  In this case the speed of sound is used instead of that of light and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen   1  Definition  The refractive index n of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum  c     and the phase velocity vphase of light in the medium   The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests and the phase of the wave moves  which may be different from the group velocity  the speed at which the pulse of light  or the envelope of the wave  moves   The definition above is sometimes referred to as the absolute index of refraction to distinguish it from definitions where the speed of light in other reference media than vacuum is used  Historically air at a standardized pressure and temperature have been common as a reference medium   2  History  Thomas Young was presumably the person who first used  and invented  the name  index of refraction   in 1807  At the same time he changed this value of refractive power into a single number  instead of the traditional ratio of two numbers  The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances  Newton  who called it the  proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction   wrote it as a ratio of two numbers  like  529 to 396   or  nearly 4 to 3   for water   Hauksbee  who called it the  ratio of refraction   wrote it as a ratio with a fixed numerator  like  10000 to 7451 9   for urine   Hutton wrote it as a ratio with a fixed denominator  like 1 3358 to 1  water    Young did not use a symbol for the index of refraction  in 1807  In the next years  others started using different symbols  n  m  and µ  The symbol n gradually prevailed   3  Typical values  For visible light most transparent media have refractive indices between 1 and 2  A few examples are given in the table to the right  These values are measured at the yellow doublet sodium D line  with a wavelength of 589 nanometers  as is conventionally done  Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices close to 1 because of their low density  Almost all solids and liquids have refractive indices above 1 3  with aerogel as the clear exception  Aerogel is a very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range from 1 002 to 1 265  Diamond lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as 2 42  Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from 1 3 to 1 7  but some high refractive index polymers can have values as high as 1 76   For infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher  Germanium is transparent in the wavelength region from 2 to 14 µm and has a refractive index of about 4  making it an important material for infrared optics   3 1  Refractive index below 1  A widespread misconception is that since  according to the theory of relativity  nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum  the refractive index cannot be lower than 1  This is erroneous since the refractive index measures the phase velocity of light  which does not carry information  The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum  and thereby give a refractive index below 1  This can occur close to resonance frequencies  for absorbing media  in plasmas  and for x rays  In the x ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1  exceptions close to some resonance frequencies   As an example  water has a refractive index of   1 − for x ray radiation at a photon energy of  0 04 nm wavelength    3 2  Negative refractive index  Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of materials with a negative refractive index  which can occur if permittivity and permeability have simultaneous negative values  This can be achieved with periodically constructed metamaterials  The resulting negative refraction  i e   a reversal of Snell s law  offers the possibility of the superlens and other exotic phenomena   4  Microscopic explanation  At the microscale  an electromagnetic wave s phase velocity is slowed in a material because the electric field creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom  primarily the electrons  proportional to the electric susceptibility of the medium   Similarly  the magnetic field creates a disturbance proportional to the magnetic susceptibility   As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave  the charges in the material will be  shaken  back and forth at the same frequency  The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency  but usually with a phase delay  as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them  see sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator   The light wave traveling in the medium is the macroscopic superposition  sum  of all such contributions in the material  the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges  This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original  leading to a slowing of the wave s phase velocity  Most of the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave  changing its velocity  However  some net energy will be radiated in other directions or even at other frequencies  see scattering    Depending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves radiated by the charge motion  there are several possibilities   If the electrons emit a light wave which is 90° out of phase with the light wave shaking them  it will cause the total light wave to travel more slowly  This is the normal refraction of transparent materials like glass or water  and corresponds to a refractive index which is real and greater than 1   If the electrons emit a light wave which is 270° out of phase with the light wave shaking them  it will cause the total light wave to travel more quickly  This is called  anomalous refraction   and is observed close to absorption lines  with x rays  and in some microwave systems  It corresponds to a refractive index less than 1   Even though the phase velocity of light is greater than the speed of light in vacuum c  the signal velocity is not  as discussed above   If the response is sufficiently strong and out of phase  the result is a negative refractive index   If the electrons emit a light wave which is 180° out of phase with the light wave shaking them  it will destructively interfere with the original light to reduce the total light intensity  This is light absorption in opaque materials and corresponds to an imaginary refractive index   If the electrons emit a light wave which is in phase with the light wave shaking them  it will amplify the light wave  This is rare  but occurs in lasers due to stimulated emission  It corresponds to an imaginary index of refraction  with the opposite sign to that of absorption  For most materials at visible light frequencies  the phase is somewhere between 90° and 180°  corresponding to a combination of both refraction and absorption   5  Dispersion  The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength  and frequency  of light  This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors  As the refractive index varies with wavelength  so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another  Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent  This is a type of chromatic aberration  which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems  In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light  the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength  and thus increase with frequency  This is called normal dispersion  in contrast to anomalous dispersion  where the refractive index increases with wavelength  For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red   For optics in the visual range the amount of dispersion of a lens material is often quantified by the Abbe number   For a more accurate description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index the Sellmeier equation can be used  It is an empirical formula that works well in describing dispersion  Sellmeier coefficients are often quoted instead of the refractive index in tables   Because of dispersion  it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength of light for which a refractive index is measured  Typically  measurements are done at various well defined spectral emission lines  for example  nD usually denotes the refractive index at the Fraunhofer  D  line  the centre of the yellow sodium double emission at 589 29 nm wavelength   6  Complex index of refraction and absorption  When light passes through a medium  some part of it will always be absorbed  This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex index of refraction   Here  the real part of the refractive index indicates the phase velocity  while the imaginary part indicates the amount of absorption loss when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material   That corresponds to absorption can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the  direction  We can do this by relating the wave number to the refractive index through   with being the vacuum wavelength  With complex wave number and refractive index this can be inserted into the plane wave expression as  Here we see that gives an exponential decay  as expected from the Beer–Lambert law  Since intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field  it will depend on the depth into the material as the absorption coefficient becomes   This also relates it to the penetration depth  the distance after which the intensity is reduced by 1 e     The imaginary part κ of the complex index of refraction is sometimes called the extinction coefficient although this can also refer to the mass attenuation coefficient  Both n and κ are dependent on the frequency  In most circumstances  light is absorbed  or  light travels forever without loss   In special situations  especially in the gain medium of lasers  it is also possible that   corresponding to an amplification of the light   An alternative convention uses instead of   but where still corresponds to loss  Therefore these two conventions are inconsistent and should not be confused  The difference is related to defining sinusoidal time dependence as versus   See Mathematical descriptions of opacity   Dielectric loss and non zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption  Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity  and at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible  resulting in almost no absorption  κ ≈ 0   However  at higher frequencies  such as visible light   dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly  reducing the material s transparency to these frequencies   The real  n  and imaginary  k  parts of the complex refractive index are related through the Kramers–Kronig relations  In 1986 A R  Forouhi and I  Bloomer deduced an equation describing k as a function of photon energy  E  applicable to amorphous materials  Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the Kramers Kronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for n as a function of E  The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by Forouhi and Bloomer in 1988   The refractive index and extinction coefficient  n and k  cannot be measured directly  They must be determined indirectly from measurable quantities that depend on them  such as reflectance  R  or transmittance  T  or ellipsometric parameters  ψ and δ  The determination of n and k from such measured quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for R or T  or ψ and δ in terms of a valid physical model for n and k  By fitting the theoretical model to the measured R or T  or ψ and δ using regression analysis  n and k can be deduced   For x ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation the complex refractive index deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than 1  It is therefore normally written as  or with the alternative convention mentioned above    7  Relations to other quantities  7 1  Optical path length  Optical path length  OPL  is the product of the geometric length d of the path light follows through a system  and the index of refraction of the medium through which it propagates    This is an important concept in optics because it determines the phase of the light and governs interference and diffraction of light as it propagates  According to Fermat s principle  light rays can be characterized as those curves that optimize the optical path length   7 2  Refraction  When light moves from one medium to another  it changes direction  i e  it is refracted  If it moves from a medium with refractive index to one with refractive index   with an incidence angle to the surface normal of   the refraction angle can be calculated from Snell s law   When light enters a material with higher refractive index  the angle of refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and the light will be refracted towards the normal of the surface  The higher the refractive index  the closer to the normal direction the light will travel  When passing into a medium with lower refractive index  the light will instead be refracted away from the normal  towards the surface   7 3  Total internal reflection  If there is no angle fulfilling Snell s law  i e    the light cannot be transmitted and will instead undergo total internal reflection  This occurs only when going to a less optically dense material  i e   one with lower refractive index  To get total internal reflection the angles of incidence must be larger than the critical angle  7 4  Reflectivity  Apart from the transmitted light there is also a reflected part  The reflection angle is equal to the incidence angle  and the amount of light that is reflected is determined by the reflectivity of the surface  The reflectivity can be calculated from the refractive index and the incidence angle with the Fresnel equations  which for normal incidence reduces to  For common glass in air  and   and thus about 4% of the incident power is reflected  At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also depend on the polarization of the incoming light  At a certain angle called Brewster s angle  p polarized light  light with the electric field in the plane of incidence  will be totally transmitted  Brewster s angle can be calculated from the two refractive indices of the interface as  7 5  Lenses  The focal length of a lens is determined by its refractive index and the radii of curvature and of its surfaces  The power of a thin lens in air is given by the Lensmaker s formula   where is the focal length of the lens   7 6  Microscope resolution  The resolution of a good optical microscope is mainly determined by the numerical aperture of its objective lens  The numerical aperture in turn is determined by the refractive index n of the medium filling the space between the sample and the lens and the half collection angle of light θ according to  For this reason oil immersion is commonly used to obtain high resolution in microscopy  In this technique the objective is dipped into a drop of high refractive index immersion oil on the sample under study   7 7  Dielectric constant  The refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals  where is the material s relative permittivity  and μr is its relative permeability  For most naturally occurring materials  μr is very close to 1 at optical frequencies  therefore n is approximately    The frequency dependent dielectric constant is simply the square of the  complex  refractive index in a non magnetic medium  one with a relative permeability of unity   The refractive index is used for optics in Fresnel equations and Snell s law  while the dielectric constant is used in Maxwell s equations and electronics   Where is the complex dielectric constant with real and imaginary parts and   and and are the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index  all functions of frequency   Conversion between refractive index and dielectric constant is done by   7 8  Density  In general  the refractive index of a glass increases with its density  However  there does not exist an overall linear relation between the refractive index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses  A relatively high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing light metal oxides such as Li2O and MgO  while the opposite trend is observed with glasses containing PbO and BaO as seen in the diagram at the right   Many oils  such as olive oil  and ethyl alcohol are examples of liquids which are more refractive  but less dense  than water  contrary to the general correlation between density and refractive index   For gases  is proportional to the density of the gas as long as the chemical composition does not change  This means that it is also proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for ideal gases   7 9  Group index  Sometimes  a  group velocity refractive index   usually called the group index is defined   where vg is the group velocity  This value should not be confused with n  which is always defined with respect to the phase velocity  When the dispersion is small  the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation  In this case the group index can thus be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as  where is the wavelength in the medium   When the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum wavelength  instead of the wavelength in the medium   the corresponding expressions for the group velocity and index are  for all values of dispersion   where is the wavelength in vacuum   7 10  Momentum  Abraham–Minkowski controversy   In 1908  Hermann Minkowski calculated the momentum of a refracted ray  p  where E is energy of the photon  c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium as follows   In 1909  Max Abraham proposed the following formula for this calculation   A 2010 study suggested that both equations are correct  with the Abraham version being the kinetic momentum and the Minkowski version being the canonical momentum  and claims to explain the contradicting experimental results using this interpretation   7 11  Other relations  As shown in the Fizeau experiment  when light is transmitted through a moving medium  its speed relative to a stationary observer is   The refractive index of a substance can be related to its polarizability with the Lorentz–Lorenz equation or to the molar refractivities of its constituents by the Gladstone–Dale relation   7 12  Refractivity  In atmospheric applications  the refractivity is taken as N    n – 1   Atmospheric refractivity is often expressed as either N    n – 1  or N    n – 1  The multiplication factors are used because the refractive index for air  n deviates from unity by at most a few parts per ten thousand   Molar refractivity  on the other hand  is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as  where ρ is the density  and M is the molecular mass   8  Nonscalar  nonlinear  or nonhomogeneous refraction  So far  we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant  scalar refractive index  These assumptions can break down in different ways  to be described in the following subsections   8 1  Birefringence  In some materials the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of the light  This is called birefringence or optical anisotropy   In the simplest form  uniaxial birefringence  there is only one special direction in the material  This axis is known as the optical axis of the material  Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an ordinary refractive index while light polarized in parallel will experience an extraordinary refractive index   The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction    Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be independent of polarization  For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams  For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction  This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear  circular and elliptical polarizations with waveplates   Many crystals are naturally birefringent  but isotropic materials such as plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through  e g   an external force or electric field  This can be utilized in the determination of stresses in structures using photoelasticity  The birefringent material is then placed between crossed polarizers  A change in birefringence will alter the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer   In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of crystal optics  the dielectric constant is a rank 2 tensor  a 3 by 3 matrix   In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes   8 2  Nonlinearity  The strong electric field of high intensity light  such as output of a laser  may cause a medium s refractive index to vary as the light passes through it  giving rise to nonlinear optics  If the index varies quadratically with the field  linearly with the intensity   it is called the optical Kerr effect and causes phenomena such as self focusing and self phase modulation  If the index varies linearly with the field  a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess inversion symmetry   it is known as the Pockels effect   8 3  Inhomogeneity  If the refractive index of a medium is not constant  but varies gradually with position  the material is known as a gradient index or GRIN medium and is described by gradient index optics  Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused  and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses  some optical fibers and other devices  Introducing GRIN elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system  reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance  The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a GRIN lens with a refractive index varying from about 1 406 in the inner core to approxiamately 1 386 at the less dense cortex  Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air   9  Refractive index measurement  9 1  Homogeneous media  The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with refractometers  They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection  The first laboratory refractometers sold commercially were developed by Ernst Abbe in the late 19th century  The same principles are still used today  In this instrument a thin layer of the liquid to be measured is placed between two prisms  Light is shone through the liquid at incidence angles all the way up to 90°  i e   light rays parallel to the surface  The second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid  so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle for total reflection  This angle can then be measured either by looking through a telescope  or with a digital photodetector placed in the focal plane of a lens  The refractive index of the liquid can then be calculated from the maximum transmission angle as   where is the refractive index of the prism   This type of devices are commonly used in chemical laboratories for identification of substances and for quality control  Handheld variants are used in agriculture by  e g   wine makers to determine sugar content in grape juice  and inline process refractometers are used in  e g   chemical and pharmaceutical industry for process control   In gemology a different type of refractometer is used to measure index of refraction and birefringence of gemstones  The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below  A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism  At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem  but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism  The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope   9 2  Refractive index variations  To measure the spatial variation of refractive index in a sample phase contrast imaging methods are used  These methods measure the variations in phase of the light wave exiting the sample  The phase is proportional to the optical path length the light ray has traversed  and thus gives a measure of the integral of the refractive index along the ray path  The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies  and therefore needs to be converted into intensity by interference with a reference beam  In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike phase contrast microscopy  differential interference contrast microscopy  DIC  or interferometry   Zernike phase contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample  so that high spatial frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low frequency reference beam  In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations  are phase shifted differently  and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts  After the specimen  the two parts are made to interfere  giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in transverse shift  In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror  One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts  If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes   There exist several phase contrast x ray imaging techniques to determine 2D or 3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the x ray regime   10  Applications  The refractive index is a very important property of the components of any optical instrument that uses refraction  It determines the focusing power of lenses  the dispersive power of prisms  and generally the path of light through the system  It is the increase in refractive index in the core that guides the light in an optical fiber  and the variations in refractive index that reduces the reflectivity of a surface treated with an anti reflective coating   Since refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance  it is often used to identify a particular substance  confirm its purity  or measure its concentration  Refractive index is used to measure solids  liquids  and gases  Most commonly it is used to measure the concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution  It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone  due to the unique chatoyance each individual stone displays  A refractometer is the instrument used to measure refractive index  For a solution of sugar  the refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content  see Brix    In GPS  the index of refraction is utilized in ray tracing to account for the radio propagation delay due to the Earth s electrically neutral atmosphere  It is also used in Satellite link design for the Computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere   11  See
