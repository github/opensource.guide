In computational complexity theory  NP is one of the most fundamental complexity classes  The abbreviation NP refers to  nondeterministic polynomial time    Intuitively  NP is the set of all decision problems for which the instances where the answer is  yes  have efficiently verifiable proofs of the fact that the answer is indeed  yes   More precisely  these proofs have to be verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine  In an equivalent formal definition  NP is the set of decision problems where the  yes  instances can be accepted in polynomial time by a non deterministic Turing machine  The equivalence of the two definitions follows from the fact that an algorithm on such a non deterministic machine consists of two phases  the first of which consists of a guess about the solution  which is generated in a non deterministic way  while the second consists of a deterministic algorithm that verifies or rejects the guess as a valid solution to the problem   The complexity class P is contained in NP  but NP contains many important problems  the hardest of which are called NP complete problems  whose solutions are sufficient to deal with any other NP problem in polynomial time  The most important open question in complexity theory  the P   NP problem  asks whether polynomial time algorithms actually exist for NP complete  and by corollary  all NP problems  It is widely believed that this is not the case   1  Formal definition  The complexity class NP can be defined in terms of NTIME as follows   Alternatively  NP can be defined using deterministic Turing machines as verifiers  A language L is in NP if and only if there exist polynomials p and q  and a deterministic Turing machine M  such that  For all x and y  the machine M runs in time p  x   on input  x y   For all x in L  there exists a string y of length q  x   such that M x y    1  For all x not in L and all strings y of length q  x    M x y    0  2  Introduction  Many natural computer science problems are covered by the class NP  In particular  the decision versions of many interesting search problems and optimization problems are contained in NP   2 1  Verifier based definition  In order to explain the verifier based definition of NP  let us consider the subset sum problem  Assume that we are given some integers  such as  −7  −3  −2  5  8   and we wish to know whether some of these integers sum up to zero  In this example  the answer is  yes   since the subset of integers  −3  −2  5  corresponds to the sum The task of deciding whether such a subset with sum zero exists is called the subset sum problem   To answer if some of the integers add to zero we can create an algorithm which obtains all the possible subsets  As the number of integers that we feed into the algorithm becomes larger  the number of subsets grows exponentially and so does the computation time  However  notice that  if we are given a particular subset  often called a certificate   we can easily check or verify whether the subset sum is zero  by just summing up the integers of the subset  So if the sum is indeed zero  that particular subset is the proof or witness for the fact that the answer is  yes   An algorithm that verifies whether a given subset has sum zero is called verifier  A problem is said to be in NP if there exists a verifier for the problem that executes in polynomial time  In case of the subset sum problem  the verifier needs only polynomial time  for which reason the subset sum problem is in NP   The  no  answer version of this problem is stated as   given a finite set of integers  does every non empty subset have a nonzero sum    The verifier based definition of NP does not require an easy to verify certificate for the  no  answers  The class of problems with such certificates for the  no  answers is called co NP  In fact  it is an open question whether all problems in NP also have certificates for the  no  answers and thus are in co NP   2 2  Machine definition  Equivalent to the verifier based definition is the following characterization  NP is the set of decision problems solvable by a non deterministic Turing machine that runs in polynomial time   This means that there is an accepting computation path if a word is in the language – co NP is defined dually with rejecting paths   This definition is equivalent to the verifier based definition because a non deterministic Turing machine could solve an NP problem in polynomial time by non deterministically selecting a certificate and running the verifier on the certificate  Similarly  if such a machine exists  then a polynomial time verifier can naturally be constructed from it   2 3  Examples  This is an incomplete list of problems that are in NP   All problems in P  For  given a certificate for a problem in P  we can ignore the certificate and just solve the problem in polynomial time  Alternatively  a deterministic Turing machine is also trivially a non deterministic Turing machine that just happens to not use any non determinism    The decision problem version of the integer factorization problem  given integers n and k  is there a factor f with 1   f   k and f dividing n   The graph isomorphism problem of determining whether two graphs can be drawn identically  All NP complete problems  e g    A variant of the travelling salesman problem  where we want to know if there is a route of some length that goes through all the nodes in a certain network  The boolean satisfiability problem  where we want to know whether or not a certain formula in propositional logic with boolean variables is true for some value of the variables  3  Why some NP problems are hard to solve  Because of the many important problems in this class  there have been extensive efforts to find polynomial time algorithms for problems in NP  However  there remain a large number of problems in NP that defy such attempts  seeming to require super polynomial time  Whether these problems are not decidable in polynomial time is one of the greatest open questions in computer science  see P   NP problem for an in depth discussion    An important notion in this context is the set of NP complete decision problems  which is a subset of NP and might be informally described as the  hardest  problems in NP  If there is a polynomial time algorithm for even one of them  then there is a polynomial time algorithm for all the problems in NP  Because of this  and because dedicated research has failed to find a polynomial algorithm for any NP complete problem  once a problem has been proven to be NP complete this is widely regarded as a sign that a polynomial algorithm for this problem is unlikely to exist   However  in practical uses  instead of spending computational resources looking for an optimal solution  a good enough  but potentially suboptimal  solution may often be found in polynomial time  Also  the real life applications of some problems are easier than their theoretical equivalents  For example  inputs to the general Travelling salesman problem need not obey the triangle inequality  unlike real road networks   4  Equivalence of definitions  The two definitions of NP as the class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic Turing machine  TM  in polynomial time and the class of problems verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time are equivalent  The proof is described by many textbooks  for example Sipser s Introduction to the Theory of Computation  section 7 3   To show this  first suppose we have a deterministic verifier  A nondeterministic machine can simply nondeterministically run the verifier on all possible proof strings  this requires only polynomially many steps because it can nondeterministically choose the next character in the proof string in each step  and the length of the proof string must be polynomially bounded   If any proof is valid  some path will accept  if no proof is valid  the string is not in the language and it will reject   Conversely  suppose we have a nondeterministic TM called A accepting a given language L  At each of its polynomially many steps  the machine s computation tree branches in at most a constant number of directions  There must be at least one accepting path  and the string describing this path is the proof supplied to the verifier  The verifier can then deterministically simulate A  following only the accepting path  and verifying that it accepts at the end  If A rejects the input  there is no accepting path  and the verifier will never accept   5  Relationship to other classes  NP contains all problems in P  since one can verify any instance of the problem by simply ignoring the proof and solving it  NP is contained in PSPACE—to show this  it suffices to construct a PSPACE machine that loops over all proof strings and feeds each one to a polynomial time verifier  Since a polynomial time machine can only read polynomially many bits  it cannot use more than polynomial space  nor can it read a proof string occupying more than polynomial space  so we do not have to consider proofs longer than this   NP is also contained in EXPTIME  since the same algorithm operates in exponential time   The complement of NP  co NP  contains those problems which have a simple proof for no instances  sometimes called counterexamples  For example  primality testing trivially lies in co NP  since one can refute the primality of an integer by merely supplying a nontrivial factor  NP and co NP together form the first level in the polynomial hierarchy  higher only than P   NP is defined using only deterministic machines  If we permit the verifier to be probabilistic  this however  is not necessarily a BPP machine    we get the class MA solvable using an Arthur Merlin protocol with no communication from Merlin to Arthur   NP is a class of decision problems  the analogous class of function problems is FNP   The only known strict inclusions came from the space hierarchy theorem and the time hierarchy theorem  and respectively they are NP NEXPTIME and NP EXPSPACE   6  Other characterizations  In terms of descriptive complexity theory  NP corresponds precisely to the set of languages definable by existential second order logic  Fagin s theorem    NP can be seen as a very simple type of interactive proof system  where the prover comes up with the proof certificate and the verifier is a deterministic polynomial time machine that checks it  It is complete because the right proof string will make it accept if there is one  and it is sound because the verifier cannot accept if there is no acceptable proof string   A major result of complexity theory is that NP can be characterized as the problems solvable by probabilistically checkable proofs where the verifier uses O log n  random bits and examines only a constant number of bits of the proof string  the class PCP log n  1    More informally  this means that the NP verifier described above can be replaced with one that just  spot checks  a few places in the proof string  and using a limited number of coin flips can determine the correct answer with high probability  This allows several results about the hardness of approximation algorithms to be proven   7  Example  The decision version of the travelling salesman problem is in NP  Given an input matrix of distances between n cities  the problem is to determine if there is a route visiting all cities with total distance less than k   A proof certificate can simply be a list of the cities  Then verification can clearly be done in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine  It simply adds the matrix entries corresponding to the paths between the cities   A non deterministic Turing machine can find such a route as follows   At each city it visits it  guesses  the next city to visit  until it has visited every vertex  If it gets stuck  it stops immediately   At the end it verifies that the route it has taken has cost less than k in O n  time  One can think of each guess as  forking  a new copy of the Turing machine to follow each of the possible paths forward  and if at least one machine finds a route of distance less than k  that machine accepts the input   Equivalently  this can be thought of as a single Turing machine that always guesses correctly   A binary search on the range of possible distances can convert the decision version of Traveling Salesman to the optimization version  by calling the decision version repeatedly  a polynomial number of times    8  References  Thomas H  Cormen  Charles E  Leiserson  Ronald L  Rivest  and Clifford Stein  Introduction to Algorithms  Second Edition  MIT Press and
