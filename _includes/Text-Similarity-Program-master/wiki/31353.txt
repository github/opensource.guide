The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams  Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978  it was later adapted to other formats  and over several years it gradually became an international multi media phenomenon  Adaptations have included stage shows  a  trilogy  of five books published between 1979 and 1992  a sixth novel penned by Eoin Colfer in 2009  a 1981 TV series  a 1984 computer game  and three series of three part comic book adaptations of the first three novels published by DC Comics between 1993 and 1996  There were also two series of towels  produced by Beer Davies  that are considered by some fans to be an  official version  of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  as they include text from the first novel  A Hollywood funded film version  produced and filmed in the UK  was released in April 2005  and radio adaptations of the third  fourth  and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005  Adams did many of these adaptations  including the novels  the TV series  the computer game  and the earliest drafts of the Hollywood film’s screenplay  and some of the stage shows introduced new material written by Adams   The title is the name of a fictional  eccentric  electronic travel guide  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  prominently featured in the series   The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy is often abbreviated HG2G and HHGTTG  as used on fan websites  also H2G2  first used by Neil Gaiman as a chapter title in Don t Panic and later by the online guide   The series is also often referred to as The Hitchhiker s Guide  Hitchhiker s  or simply The Guide  This title can refer to any of the various incarnations of the story of which the books are the most widely distributed  having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005   1  Plot  The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory  as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation  Throughout all versions  the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent  a hapless Englishman  although the story also follows the adventure of other major characters  Ford Prefect  who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form  automobiles   an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook  Zaphod Beeblebrox  Ford s semi cousin and the Galactic President  the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android  and Trillian  formerly known as Tricia McMillan  a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and the only other human survivor of Earth s destruction   2  Background  The first radio series comes from a proposal called  The Ends of the Earth   six self contained episodes  all ending with Earth s being destroyed in a different way  While writing the first episode  Adams realized that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context  and that this alien needed a reason to be there  Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a  wholly remarkable book  named The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  As the first radio episode s writing progressed  the Guide became the centre of his story  and he decided to focus the series on it  with the destruction of Earth being the only hold over   Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the Hitch hiker s Guide to Europe book  and while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars  thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy as well  However  he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself  and only remembered himself telling the story  His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of  hitch hiking around the galaxy  to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973   Adams s fictional Guide is an electronic guidebook to the Milky Way galaxy  originally published by Megadodo Publications  one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta  The narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide  The voice of the Guide  Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions  later William Franklyn in the third  fourth and fifth radio series  and Stephen Fry in the movie version   also provides general narration   3  Original radio series  The first radio series of six episodes  called  Fits  after the names of the sections of Lewis Carroll s nonsense poem  The Hunting of the Snark   was broadcast in 1978 on BBC Radio 4  Despite a low key launch of the series  the first episode was broadcast at 10 30 pm on Wednesday  8 March 1978   it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio  A one off episode  a  Christmas special   was broadcast later in the year  The BBC was in the practice  at the time  of commissioning  Christmas Special  episodes for popular radio series  and while an early draft of this episode of The Hitchhiker s Guide had a Christmas related plotline  it was decided to be  in slightly poor taste  and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series  This episode was released as part of the second radio series and  later  The Secondary Phase on cassettes and CDs  The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired  in a slightly edited version  in the United States on NPR Playhouse   The first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more times in the next few years  This led to an LP re recording  produced independently of the BBC for sale  and a further adaptation of the series as a book  A second radio series  which consisted of a further six episodes  and bringing the total number of episodes to 12  was broadcast in 1980   The radio series  and the LP and TV versions  greatly benefited from the narration of noted comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book  He was cast after it was decided that a  Peter Jonesy  sort of voice was required  This led to a three month search for an actor who sounded exactly like Peter Jones  and was  eventually  unsuccessful  so  leading to the producers having to reluctantly  and indeed expensively  hire Peter Jones as the  Peter Jonesy  kind of voice originally looked for  His sonorous  avuncular tones undoubtedly gave the series a tremendous boost and firmly established the tenor of the piece   The series was also notable for its use of sound  being the first comedy series to be produced in stereo  Adams said that he wanted the programme s production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album  Much of the programme s budget was spent on sound effects  which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland  for the pilot episode and the complete second series  and Dick Mills and Harry Parker  for the remaining episodes  2–6  of the first series   The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of Hitchhiker s became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into four channel Dolby Surround  This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series   The theme tune used for the radio  television  LP and film versions is  Journey of the Sorcerer   an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon and recorded by The Eagles on their album One of These Nights  Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording  a sound alike cover by Tim Souster was used for the LP and TV series  another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film  and still another arrangement  this time by Philip Pope  was recorded to be released with the CDs of the last three radio series  Apparently  Adams chose this song for its futuristic sounding nature  but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it  which  as Geoffrey Perkins recalls  Adams said would give an  on the road  hitch hiking feel  to it   The twelve episodes were released  in a slightly edited form  removing the Pink Floyd music and two other tunes  Hummed  by Marvin when the team land on Magrathea  on CD and cassette in 1988  becoming the first CD release in the BBC Radio Collection  They were re released in 1992  and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First through Sixth as  The Primary Phase  and Fits the Seventh through Twelfth as  The Secondary Phase  instead of just  the first series  and  the second series   It was about at this time that a  Tertiary Phase  was first discussed with Dirk Maggs  adapting Life  the Universe and Everything  but this series would not be recorded for another ten years   The audience survey reaction report at the time actually reported a very split reaction – people hated it  or loved it  The decision to commission the second series was backed by management gut instincts rather than clear metrics   Main cast   Simon Jones as Arthur Dent  Geoffrey McGivern as Ford Prefect  Susan Sheridan as Trillian  Mark Wing Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox  Stephen Moore as Marvin  the Paranoid Android  Richard Vernon as Slartibartfast  Peter Jones as The Book  4  Novels  The novels are described as  a trilogy in five parts   having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book  and then a  trilogy in four parts  on the release of the fourth book  The US edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend  The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker s Trilogy  on the cover  Subsequent re releases of the other novels bore the legend  The  first  second  third  fourth  book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker s Trilogy   In addition  the blurb on the fifth book describes the book as  the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word  trilogy   The plots of the television and radio series are more or less the same as that of the first two novels  though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed  Much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd  but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here  Many consider the books  version of events to be definitive  because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story  However  they are not the final version that Adams produced   Before his death from a heart attack at age 49 in 2001  Adams was considering writing a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker s series  He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel  under the working title The Salmon of Doubt  but felt that the book was not working and abandoned it  In an interview  he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better in the Hitchhiker s series  and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series  He described Mostly Harmless as  a very bleak book  and said he  would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note   Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment  he would at least start with all the characters in the same place  Eoin Colfer  who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker s series in 2008–09  used this latter concept but none of the plot ideas from The Salmon of Doubt   4 1  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  In The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  published in 1979   the characters visit the legendary planet Magrathea  home to the now collapsed planet building industry  and meet Slartibartfast  a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the fjords of Norway  Through archival recordings  he relates the story of a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings who built a computer named Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life  the Universe  and Everything  When the answer was revealed to be 42  Deep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn t know what they were asking  It went on to predict that another computer  more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for the answer   Later on  referencing this  Adams would create the 42 Puzzle  a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways  all yielding the answer 42    The computer  often mistaken for a planet  because of its size and use of biological components   was the Earth  and was destroyed by Vogons to make way for a hyperspatial express route five minutes before the conclusion of its 10 million year program  Two members of the race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings who commissioned the Earth in the first place disguise themselves as Trillian s mice  and want to dissect Arthur s brain to help reconstruct the question  since he was part of the Earth s matrix moments before it was destroyed  and so he is likely to have part of the question buried in his brain  Trillian is also human but had left Earth six months previously with Zaphod Beeblebrox  President of the Galaxy  The protagonists escape  setting course for  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe   The mice  in Arthur s absence  create a phony question since it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal   The book was adapted from the first four radio episodes  It was first published in 1979  initially in paperback  by Pan Books  after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelisation  an action they would later regret  The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week  and sold over 250 000 copies within three months of its release  A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books  a division of Random House in the United States in October 1980  and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give away of 3 000 free copies in the magazine Rolling Stone to build word of mouth  In 2005  Del Rey Books rereleased the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie  To date  it has sold over 14 million copies   A photo illustrated edition of the first novel appeared in 1994   4 2  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  published in 1980   Zaphod is separated from the others and finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe  Zaphod meets Zarniwoop  a conspirator and editor for The Guide  who knows where to find the secret ruler  Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways  the restaurant of the title  Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there  which turns out to be a stunt ship pre programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show  Unable to change course  the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship  which is working other than having no automatic control  someone must remain behind to operate it   and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself  Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat   Ford and Arthur  meanwhile  end up on a spacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilisation  The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth  Ford and Arthur are stranded  and it becomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans  having displaced the Earth s indigenous hominids  This has disrupted the Earth s programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from Arthur s subconscious mind by pulling lettered tiles from a Scrabble set  it is  What do you get if you multiply six by nine   Arthur then comments   I ve always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the universe    The book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio series—covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode  although the ordering was greatly changed  in particular  the events of Fit the Sixth  with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre historic Earth  end the book  and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted   and most of the Brontitall incident was omitted  instead of the Haggunenon sequence  co written by John Loyd  the Disaster Area stuntship was substituted—this having first been introduced in the LP version  Adams himself considered Restaurant to be his best novel of the five   4 3  Life  the Universe and Everything  In Life  the Universe and Everything  published in 1982   Ford and Arthur travel through the space time continuum from prehistoric Earth to Lord s Cricket Ground  There they run into Slartibartfast  who enlists their aid in preventing galactic war  Long ago  the people of Krikkit attempted to wipe out all life in the Universe  but they were stopped and imprisoned on their home planet  now they are poised to escape  With the help of Marvin  Zaphod and Trillian  our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go their separate ways   This was the first Hitchhiker s book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio  Its story was based on a treatment Adams had written for a Doctor Who theatrical release  with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast  to begin with   and later Trillian and Arthur   In 2004 it was adapted for radio as the Tertiary Phase of the radio series   4 4  So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish  In So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish  published in 1984   Arthur returns home to Earth  rather surprisingly since it was destroyed when he left  He meets and falls in love with a girl named Fenchurch  and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign  Eventually he rejoins Ford  who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime  to hitch hike one last time and see God s Final Message to His Creation  Along the way  they are joined by Marvin  the Paranoid Android  who  although 37 times older than the universe itself  what with time travel and all   has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring   This was the first Hitchhiker s novel which was not an adaptation of any previously written story or script  In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quandary Phase of the radio series   The NOFX record  So Long  and Thanks for All the Shoes  is a play on the name of this book  Guitarist Eric Melvin is a huge fan of the Hitchhiker series  and has a  Don t Panic  tattoo in tribute to the books   4 5  Mostly Harmless  Finally  in Mostly Harmless  published in 1992   Vogons take over The Hitchhiker s Guide  under the name of InfiniDim Enterprises   to finish  once and for all  the task of obliterating the Earth  After abruptly losing Fenchurch and travelling around the galaxy despondently  Arthur s spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella  where he settles in happily as the official sandwich maker for a small village of simple  peaceful people  Meanwhile  Ford Prefect breaks into The Guide s offices  gets himself an infinite expense account from the computer system  and then meets The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Mark II  an artificially intelligent  multi dimensional guide with vast power and a hidden purpose  After he declines this dangerously powerful machine s aid  which he receives anyway   he sends it to Arthur Dent for safety   Oh yes  whose  —Arthur    Trillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for travelling money to have a daughter  and when she goes to cover a war  she leaves her daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent with Arthur  Random  a more than typically troubled teenager  steals The Guide Mark II and uses it to get to Earth  Arthur  Ford  Trillian  and Tricia McMillan  Trillian in this alternate universe  follow her to a crowded club  where an anguished Random becomes startled by a noise and inadvertently fires her gun at Arthur  The shot misses Arthur and kills a man  the ever unfortunate Agrajag   Immediately afterwards  The Guide Mark II causes the removal of all possible Earths from probability  All of the main characters  save Zaphod  were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed  bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons   In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quintessential Phase of the radio series  with the final episode first transmitted on 21 June 2005   4 6  And Another Thing     It was announced on 17 September 2008 that the author of Artemis Fowl  Eoin Colfer  had been commissioned to write the sixth instalment entitled And Another Thing    with the support of Jane Belson  Adams  widow   The story begins as death rays bear down on Earth  and the characters awaken from a virtual reality  Zaphod picks them up shortly before they re killed  but completely fails to escape the death beams  They are then saved by Bowerick Wowbagger  the Infinitely Prolonged  whom they agree to help kill  Zaphod travels to Asgard to get Thor s help  In the meantime  the Vogons are heading to destroy a colony of people who also escaped Earth s destruction  on the planet Nano  Arthur  Wowbagger  Trillian and Random head to Nano to try to stop the Vogons  and on the journey  Wowbagger and Trillian fall in love  making Wowbagger question whether or not he wants to be killed  Zaphod arrives with Thor  who then signs up to be the planet s God  With Random s help  Thor almost kills Wowbagger  Wowbagger  who merely loses his immortality  then marries Trillian   Thor then stops the first Vogon attack  and apparently dies  Meanwhile  Constant Mown  son of Prostetnic Jeltz  convinces his father that the people on the planet are not citizens of Earth  but are  in fact  citizens of Nano  which means that it would be illegal to kill them  As the book draws to a close  Arthur is on his way to check out a possible university for Random  when  during a hyperspace jump  he is flung across alternate universes  has a brief encounter with Fenchurch  and ends up exactly where he d want to be  And then the Vogons turn up again   The book was published by Penguin Books in the UK and Hyperion in the US on 12 October 2009   5  Other Hitchhiker s related books and stories  5 1  Related stories  A short story by Adams   Young Zaphod Plays it Safe   first appeared in The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book  a special large print compilation of different stories and pictures that raised money for the new  at the time  Comic Relief charity in the UK  It is in The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide To The Galaxy  which also contains the five novels from the Hitchhiker series  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Life  the Universe and Everything  So Long  and Thanks for All the Fish  and Mostly Harmless  The story also appears in some of the omnibus editions of the trilogy  and in The Salmon of Doubt  There are two versions of this story  one of which is slightly more explicit in its political commentary   Also appearing in The Ultimate Hitchhiker s Guide  at the end of Adams  introduction  is a list of instructions on  How to Leave the Planet   providing a humorous explanation of how one might replicate Arthur and Ford s feat at the beginning of Hitchhikers   A novel  Douglas Adams s Starship Titanic written by Terry Jones  is based on Adams s computer game of the same name  which in turn is based on an idea from Life  the Universe and Everything  The idea concerns a luxury passenger starship that suffers  spontaneous massive existence failure  on its maiden voyage   Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged  a character from Life  the Universe and Everything  also appears in a short story by Adams titled  The Private Life of Genghis Khan  which appears in some early editions of The Salmon of Doubt   5 2  Published radio scripts  Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins collaborated on The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  The Original Radio Scripts  first published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985  A tenth anniversary  of the script book publication  edition was printed in 1995  and a twenty fifth anniversary  of the first radio series broadcast  edition was printed in 2003   The 2004 series was produced by Above The Title Productions and the scripts were published in July 2005  with production notes for each episode  This second radio script book is entitled The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts  The Tertiary  Quandary and Quintessential Phases  Douglas Adams gets the primary writer s credit  as he wrote the original novels   and there is a foreword by Simon Jones  introductions by the producer and the director  and other introductory notes from other members of the cast   6  TV series  The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six episode television series  directed and produced by Alan J  W  Bell  which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981  It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth  A second series was at one point planned  with a storyline  according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing Davey  that would have come from Adams s abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project  instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series   However  Adams got into disputes with the BBC  accounts differ  problems with budget  scripts  and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes   and the second series was never made  Elements of Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen were instead used in the third novel  Life  the Universe and Everything   The main cast was the same as the original radio series  except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern  and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan   6 1  Other television appearances  Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC s The Big Read survey and programme  broadcast in late 2003  The film  directed by Deep Sehgal  starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent  alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect  Nigel Planer as the voice of Marvin  Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought  Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide  Roger Lloyd Pack as Slartibartfast  and Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg   7  Radio series three to five  On 21 June 2004  the BBC announced in a press release that a new series of Hitchhiker s based on the third novel would be broadcast as part of its autumn schedule  produced by Above the Title Productions Ltd  The episodes were recorded in late 2003  but actual transmission was delayed while an agreement was reached with The Walt Disney Company over Internet re broadcasts  as Disney had begun pre production on the film  This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the fourth and fifth novels  These were broadcast in September and October 2004 and May and June 2005  CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each series   The adaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely  which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series in comparison to the second novel  Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel  and those that did occur happened in a different order  the two series split in completely different directions  The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly Harmless are now foreshadowed in the adaptation of So Long and Thanks For All The Fish  while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five  and their divergent plotlines  together  most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase  While Mostly Harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending  Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version  ending it on a much more upbeat note  reuniting the cast one last time   The core cast for the third through fifth radio series remained the same  except for the replacement of Peter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book  and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast  since both had died   Homage to Jones  iconic portrayal of the Book was paid twice  the gradual shift of voices

Dickinson  who played Trillian in the TV series  here played Tricia McMillan  an English born  American accented alternate universe version of Trillian  while David Dixon  the television series  Ford Prefect  made a cameo appearance as the  Ecological Man   Jane Horrocks appeared in the new semi regular role of Fenchurch  Arthur s girlfriend  and Samantha Béart joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian s daughter  Random Dent  Also reprising their roles from the original radio series were Jonathan Pryce as Zarniwoop  here blended with a character from the final novel to become Zarniwoop Vann Harl   Rula Lenska as Lintilla and her clones  and also as the Voice of the Bird   and Roy Hudd as Milliways compere Max Quordlepleen  as well as the original radio series  announcer  John Marsh   The series also featured guest appearances by such noted personalities as Joanna Lumley as the Sydney Opera House Woman  Jackie Mason as the East River Creature  Miriam Margolyes as the Smelly Photocopier Woman  BBC Radio cricket legends Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman as themselves  June Whitfield as the Raffle Woman  Leslie Phillips as Hactar  Saeed Jaffrey as the Man on the Pole  Sir

century after the first book was published  the big screen adaptation of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy was finally shot  Pre production began in 2003  filming began on 19 April 2004 and post production began in early September 2004   After a London premiere on 20 April 2005  it was released on 28 April in the UK and Australia  29 April in the United States and Canada  and 29 July in South Africa   A full list of release dates is available at the IMDb   The movie stars Martin Freeman as Arthur  Mos Def as Ford  Sam Rockwell as President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian  with Alan Rickman providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android  and Warwick Davis acting in Marvin s costume   and Stephen Fry as the voice of the Guide Narrator   The plot of the film adaptation of Hitchhiker s Guide differs widely from that of the radio show  book and television series  The romantic triangle between Arthur  Zaphod  and Trillian is more prominent in the film  and visits to Vogsphere  the homeworld of the Vogons  which  in the books  was already abandoned   and Viltvodle VI are inserted  The film covers roughly events in the first four radio episodes  and ends with the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  leaving the opportunity for a sequel open  A unique appearance is made by the Point of View Gun  a device specifically created by Adams himself for the movie   Commercially the film was a modest success  taking $21 million in its opening weekend in the United States  and nearly £3 3 million in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom   The film was released on DVD  Region 2  PAL  in the UK on 5 September 2005  Both a standard double disc edition and a UK exclusive numbered limited edition  Giftpack  were released on this date  The  Giftpack  edition includes a copy of the novel with a  movie tie in  cover  and collectible prints from the film  packaged in a replica of the film s version of the Hitchhiker s Guide prop  A single disc widescreen or full screen edition  Region 1  NTSC  were made available in the USA and Canada on 13 September 2005  Single disc releases in the Blu ray format and UMD format for the PlayStation Portable were also released on the respective dates in these three countries   9  Stage shows  There have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  There were three early professional productions  which were staged in 1979 and 1980   The first of these was performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London  between 1 and 9 May 1979  starring Chris Langham as Arthur Dent  Langham later returned to Hitchhiker s as Prak in the final episode of 2004 s Tertiary Phase  and Richard Hope as Ford Prefect  This show was adapted from the first series  scripts and was directed by Ken Campbell  who went on to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series  The show ran 90 minutes  but had an audience limited to eighty people per night  Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms  and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar  1 2000th of an inch above the floor  This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large costume  The narration of  The Book  was split between two usherettes  an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of H2G2  One of these usherettes  Cindy Oswin  went on to voice Trillian for the LP adaptation   The second stage show was performed throughout Wales between 15 January and 23 February 1980  This was a production of Clwyd Theatr Cymru  and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge  The company performed adaptations of complete radio episodes  at times doing two episodes in a night  and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three hour sessions  This adaptation was performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981  Plymouth s Theatre Royal in May–June 1982  and also at the Belgrade Theatre  Coventry  in July 1983   The third  and least successful stage show was held at the Rainbow Theatre in London  in July 1980  This was the second production directed by Ken Campbell  The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of rock operas in the 1970s  and both reference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this  coupled with incidental music throughout the performance  caused some reviewers to label it as a  musical   This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the  Dish of the Day  sequence  The production ran for over three hours  and was widely panned for this  as well as for the music  laser effects  and the acting  Despite attempts to shorten the script  and make other changes  it closed three or four weeks early  accounts differ   and lost a lot of money  Despite the bad reviews  there were at least two stand out performances  Michael Cule and David Learner both went on from this production to appearances in the TV adaptation   In December 2011 a new stage production was announced to begin touring in June 2012  This included members of the original radio and TV casts such as Simon Jones  Geoff McGivern  Susan Sheridan  Mark Wing Davey and Stephen Moore with VIP guests playing the role of the book  It was produced in the form of a radio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed  This production was based on the first four Fits in the first act  with the second act covering material from the rest of the series  The show also featured  a band  who performed the songs Share and Enjoy  the Krikkit song Under the Ink Black Sky  Marvin s song How I Hate The Night  and Marvin  which was a minor hit in 1981   10  Live radio adaptation  On Saturday 29 March 2014  Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live audience  featuring many members of the original cast including Stephen Moore  Susan Sheridan  Mark Wing Davey  Simon Jones and Geoff McGivern  with John Lloyd as the book   The adaptation was adapted by Dirk Maggs primarily from Fit the First  including material from the books and later radio Fits as well as some new jokes  It formed part of Radio 4 s Character Invasion series   11  LP album adaptations  The first four radio episodes were adapted for a new double LP  also entitled The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  appended with  Part One  for the subsequent Canadian release   first by mail order only  and later into stores  The double LP and its sequel were originally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979 and 1980  with the catalogue numbers ORA042 and ORA054 respectively  They were first released by Hannibal Records in 1982  as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307  respectively  in the United States and Canada  and later re released in a slightly abridged edition by Simon & Schuster s Audioworks in the mid 1980s  Both were produced by Geoffrey Perkins and featured cover artwork by Hipgnosis   The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes  although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing  Despite this  other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when the original scripts from the radio series were eventually published can be heard in the LP version  The Simon & Schuster cassettes omit the Veet Voojagig narration  the cheerleader s speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven and one half million year programme  and a few other lines from both sides of the second LP of the set   Most of the original cast returned  except for Susan Sheridan  who was recording a voice for the character of Princess Eilonwy in The Black Cauldron for Walt Disney Pictures  Cindy Oswin voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place  Other casting changes in the first double LP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman  and Valentine Dyall as the voice of Deep Thought  Adams s voice can be heard making the public address announcements on Magrathea   Because of copyright issues  the music used during the first radio series was either replaced  or in the case of the title it was re recorded in a new arrangement  Composer Tim Souster did both duties  with Paddy Kingsland contributing music as well   and Souster s version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series   The sequel LP was released  singly  as The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Part Two  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe in the UK  and simply as The Restaurant at the End of the Universe in the USA  The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth  but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant   Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo    and changes the Haggunenon sequence to  Disaster Area    As the result of a misunderstanding  the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended to make  Perkins has said    I t is far too long on each side  It s just a rough cut        I felt it was flabby  and I wanted to speed it up   The Simon & Schuster Audioworks re release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its original release  The scene with Ford Prefect and Hotblack Desiato s bodyguard is omitted   Sales for the first double LP release were primarily through mail order  Total sales reached over 60 000 units  with half of those being mail order  and the other half through retail outlets  This is in spite of the facts that Original Records  warehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time  and that Paul Neil Milne Johnstone complained about his name and then current address being included in the recording  This was corrected for a later pressing of the double LP by  cut ting  up that part of the master tape and reassembl ing  it in the wrong order   The second LP release   Part Two   also only sold a total of 60 000 units in the UK  The distribution deals for the USA and Canada with Hannibal Records and Simon and Schuster were later negotiated by Douglas Adams and his agent  Ed Victor  after gaining full rights to the recordings from Original Records  which went bankrupt   12  Audiobook adaptations  There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel  The first was an abridged edition  ISBN 0 671 62964 6   recorded in the mid

differ   the British company Supersoft published a text based adventure game based on the book  which was released in versions for the Commodore PET and Commodore 64  One account states that there was a dispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted  and following legal action the game was withdrawn and all remaining copies were destroyed  Another account states that the programmer  Bob Chappell  rewrote the game to remove all Hitchhiker s references  and republished it as  Cosmic Capers    Officially  the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best selling  interactive fiction   or text based adventure game  distributed by Infocom  It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular Steve Meretzky and was one of Infocom s most successful games  As with many Infocom games  the box contained a number of  feelies  including a  Don t panic  badge  some  pocket fluff   a pair of peril sensitive sunglasses  an order for the destruction of the Earth  a small  clear plastic bag containing  a microscopic battle fleet  and an order for the destruction of Arthur Dent s house  signed by Adams and Meretzky    In September 2004  it was revived by the BBC on the Hitchhiker s section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase  and is still available to play online  This new version uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom written interpreter  by Sean Sollé  and Flash programming by Shimon Young  both of whom used to work at The Digital Village  TDV   The new version includes illustrations by Rod Lord  who was head of Pearce Animation Studios in 1980  which produced the guide graphics for the TV series  On 2 March 2005 it won the Interactive BAFTA in the  best online entertainment  category   A sequel to the original Infocom game was never made  An all new  fully graphical game was designed and developed by a joint venture between The Digital Village and PAN Interactive  no connection to Pan Books   Pan Mcmillan   This new game was planned and developed between 1998 and 2002  but like the sequel to the Infocom game  it also never materialised  In April 2005  Starwave Mobile released two mobile games to accompany the release of the film adaptation  The first  developed by Atatio  was called  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Vogon Planet Destructor   It was a typical top down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story  The second game  developed by TKO Software  was a graphical adventure game named  The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Adventure Game   Despite its name  the newly designed puzzles by TKO Software s Ireland studio were different from the Infocom ones  and the game followed the movie s script closely and included the new characters and places  The  Adventure Game  won the IGN s  Editors  Choice Award  in May 2005   On 25 May 2011  Hothead Games announced they were working on a new edition of The Guide  Along with the announcement  Hothead Games launched a teaser web site made to look like an announcement from Megadodo Publications that The Guide will soon be available on Earth  It has since been revealed that they are developing an iOS app in the style of the fictional Guide   14  Comic books  In 1993  DC Comics  in conjunction with Byron Preiss Visual Publications  published a three part comic book adaptation of the novelisation of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  This was followed up with three part adaptations of The Restaurant at the End of the Universe in 1994  and Life  the Universe and Everything in 1996  There was also a series of collectors  cards with art from and inspired by the comic adaptations of the first book  and a graphic novelisation  or  collected edition   combining the three individual comic books from 1993  itself released in May 1997  Douglas Adams was deeply opposed to the use of American English spellings and idioms in what he felt was a very British story  and had to be talked into it by the American publishers  although he remained very unhappy with the compromise   The adaptations were scripted by John Carnell  Steve Leialoha provided the art for Hitchhiker s and the layouts for Restaurant  Shepherd Hendrix did the finished art for Restaurant  Neil Vokes and John Nyberg did the finished artwork for Life  based on breakdowns by Paris Cullins  Book 1  and Christopher Schenck  Books 2–3   The miniseries were edited by Howard Zimmerman and Ken Grobe   15   Hitch Hikeriana   Many merchandising and spin off items  or  Hitch Hikeriana   were produced in the early 1980s  including towels in different colours  all bearing the Guide entry for towels  Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books  Touchstone Pictures   Disney for the 2005 movie  and different towels made for ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha  the official Hitchhiker s Appreciation society  Other items that first appeared in the mid 1980s were T shirts  including those made for Infocom  such as one bearing the legend  I got the Babel Fish  for successfully completing one of that game s most difficult puzzles   and a Disaster Area tour T shirt  Other official items have included  Beeblebears   teddy bears with an extra head and arm  named after Hitchhiker s character Zaphod Beeblebrox  sold by the official Appreciation Society   an assortment of pin on buttons and a number of novelty singles  Many of the above items are displayed throughout the 2004  25th Anniversary Illustrated Edition  of the novel  which used items from the personal collections of fans of the series   Stephen Moore recorded two novelty singles in character as Marvin  the Paranoid Android   Marvin   Metal Man  and  Reasons To Be Miserable   Marvin I Love You   The last song has appeared on a Dr  Demento compilation  Another single featured the re recorded  Journey of the Sorcerer   arranged by Tim Souster  backed with  Reg Nullify In Concert  by Reg Nullify  and  Only the End of the World Again  by Disaster Area  including Douglas Adams on bass guitar    These discs have since become collector s items   The 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles  mostly through the National Entertainment Collectibles Association  These included three prop replicas of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld  a mug  a pen and a stapler   sets of  action figures  with a height of either 3 or 6 inches  76 or 150 mm   a gun—based on a prop used by Marvin  the Paranoid Android  that shoots foam darts—a crystal cube  shot glasses  a ten inch  254 mm  high version of Marvin with eyes that light up green  and  yarn doll  versions of Arthur Dent  Ford Prefect  Trillian  Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox  Also  various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie  notably re recordings of  Marvin  and  Reasons To Be Miserable   sung by Stephen Fry  along with some of the  Guide Entries   newly written material read in character by Fry   16  International phenomenon  Many science fiction fans and radio listeners outside the United Kingdom were first exposed to The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy in one of two ways  shortwave radio broadcasts of the original radio series  or by Douglas Adams being  Guest of Honour  at the 1979 World Science Fiction Convention  Seacon  held in Brighton  England  UK  It was there that the radio series was nominated for a Hugo Award  the first radio series to receive a nomination  but lost to Superman  A convention exclusively for H2G2  Hitchercon I  was held in Glasgow  Scotland  UK  in September 1980  the year that the official fan club  ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha  was organised  In the early 1980s  versions of H2G2 became available in the United States  Canada  Germany  Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis   Denmark  Håndbog for vakse galakseblaffere   the Netherlands  Transgalactisch Liftershandboek   Sweden  Liftarens guide till galaxen   Finland  Linnunradan Käsikirja Liftareille  and also Israel   17  Spelling  The different versions of the series spell the title differently−thus Hitch Hiker s Guide  Hitch Hiker s Guide and Hitchhiker s Guide are used in different editions  US or UK   formats  audio or print  and compilations of the book  Some editions used different spellings on the spine and title page  The BBC s h2g2 style manual claims that Hitchhiker s Guide is the spelling Adams preferred  At least two reference works make note of the inconsistency in the titles  Both  however  repeat the statement that Adams decided in 2000 that  everyone should spell it the same way  one word  no hyphen  from then on    18  See also  Hitchhiking  List of minor characters from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Places in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy  Phrases from The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy
