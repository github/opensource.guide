Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan  Urdu    Bengali  জেনারেল ইয়াহিয়া খান February 1917 舑 10 August 1980   popularly known as Yahya Khan was a four star general and statesman who served as the third President of Pakistan from 1969 until the fall of East Pakistan as a follow up to Pakistan s defeat in the war with India in 1971  Serving with distinction in World War II as a British Indian Army officer  Yahya opted for Pakistan in 1947 and held critical command assignments   After helping to conduct military infiltration against India in the 1965 war  Yahya was appointed commander in chief of army in 1966– a position he held until the final days of 1971 war  Amid political upheaval forced President Ayub Khan to resign in 1969  Yahya installed a military government after enforcing the martial law for the second time in Pakistan s history  After promulgating executive order to disestablishment West Pakistan  he held the country s first nationwide free and fair general elections in 1970  which witnessed Awami League led by Mujibur Rahman gaining majority in East Pakistan  Under pressured by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto whose PPP which had won from the four provinces of Pakistan but had far fewer votes  Yahya delayed handing over power to Awami League  As civil unrest erupted all over East Pakistan  Yahya initiated military operations to quell the rebellion  With reports of genocide by the Pakistan army and their local collaborators against Bengali civilians  During the nine month long Bangladesh war for independence  members of the Pakistani military and supporting militias killed about 3 000 000 people and raped between 200 000–400 000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape   Tensions escalated with India  which intervened on the side of the Mukti Bahini insurgency in 1971  In the resulting Indo Pakistani war of 1971  which lasted less than two weeks  Pakistan surrendered its eastern command  with about 93 000 soldiers in East Pakistan becoming prisoners of war  Following the independence of Bangladesh  powerful public demonstrations and mass rallies against Yahya in Pakistan forced him to hand over the power to Zulfikar Bhutto as well as stepping down from the post of commander in chief in disgrace  Military decorations and honors were stripped from Yahya and he was placed under house arrest for most of the 1970s  With Bhutto s removal in 1977  Yahya was released by provincial administrator Fazle Haq  He died in 1980 in Rawalpindi  He is viewed largely negatively by Pakistani historians  and is considered among the least successful of the country s leaders  He is also accused to be inept  womanizer and alcoholic   1  Early life  Agha Yahya Khan was born in Chakwal  Punjab  British Indian Empire on 4 February 1917  according to the references written by Russian sources   According to sources his family descended from the elite soldier class of Nader Shah of Khorasan   2  Military career  Yahya Khan was educated in Col  Brown Cambridge School in Dehra Dun and Punjab University  Yahya entered in the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and was commissioned into the Indian Army in 1938  He performed well and served with distinction during the World War II in North African theater  and was taken as the Prisoner of war  POW  by Italy  He escaped from there on his third attempt  His active service further saw actions as part of the 4th Infantry Division in the North Africa  Middle East  and Mediterranean theatres of the war  including Iraq  Italy  and North Africa   2 1  1965 war and Commander in chief  After the World War II  he decided to join the Pakistan Army in 1947  At the age of 34  he was promoted as Brigadier General and commanded the 106th Infantry Brigade that was deployed in LoC ceasefire region in Jammu and Kashmir  He was described as a  hard drinking soldier  who liked both his women and wine  though he was a professional soldier  Yahya also co founded the Command and Staff College in Quetta  Balochistan  He played a pivotal role in sustaining the support for President Ayub Khan s campaign in 1965 presidential elections against Fatima Jinnah  In recognition  he was promoted as Major General and made GOC of 7th Infantry Division of Pakistan Army  which he commanded during the 1965 war with India  At this assignment  he was not instrumental in planning and executing the military infiltration operation  the Grand Slam  which failed miserably due to General Yahya s blunderous delay owing to change of command decision  the Indian Army crossed the intentional border and made a beeline for Lahore   Despite failure and to utter disgust  Yahya was promoted as Lieutenant General after his promotion papers were personally approved by President Ayub Khan in 1966  at a stint as an appointed Deputy Army Commander in Chief  He was appointed as commander in chief of Pakistan Army in March 1966  At promotion  Yahya Khan superseded two of his seniors  Lieutenant General Altaf Qadir and Lieutenant General Bakhtiar Rana   3  President of Pakistan  During the course of 1968  the political pressure exerted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had weakened the President Ayub Khan  who had earlier sacked Bhutto after disagreeing with President Ayub s decision to implement on Tashkent Agreement  facilitated by the Soviet Union to end the hostilities with India  To ease the situation  President Ayub tried reaching out to terms with Pakistan Peoples Party  PPP  and Awami League  AL   but remain unsuccessful  In poor health  President Ayub abrogated his own constitution and suddenly resigned from the presidency   On 24 March 1969  President Ayub directed a letter to General Yahya Khan  inviting him to deal with the situation  as it was  the beyond the capacity of  civil  government to deal with the    Complex situation   On 26 March 1969  General Yahya appeared in national television and announced to enforce a martial law in all over the country  The 1962 Constitution was abrogated  dissolved the parliament  and dismissed the President Ayub s civilian officials  In his first nationwide address  Yahya maintained   I will not tolerate disorder  Let everyone remain at his post    On immediate effect  he installed a military government and featured active duty military officials   Yahya Khan Administration  3 1  National Security Council and LFO  President Yahya was well aware of this explosive situation and decided to bring changes all over the country  His earlier initiatives directed towards establishing the National Security Council  NSC  with Major General Ghulam Omar being its first advisor  It was formed to analyze and prepare assessments towards issues relating the political and national security   Secondly in 1969  President Yahya promulgated the Legal Framework Order No  1970 which disestablished the One Unit programme where West Pakistan was formed  Instead  LFO No  1970 hence removed the prefix West  instead adding Pakistan  The decree has no effect on East Pakistan  Following this  President Yahya announced to held nationwide general elections in 1970  and appointed Judge Abdus Sattar as Chief Election Commissioner of Election Commission of Pakistan  Changes were carried out by President Yahya to reversed the country back towards parliamentary democracy   4  Last days of East Pakistan  4 1  1970 general elections  By 28 July 1969  President Yahya had set a framework for elections that were to be held in December 1970  Finally  the general elections were held in all over the country  In East Pakistan  the Awami League led by Mujibur Rahman held almost all mandate  but no seat in any of four provinces of West Pakistan  The socialist Pakistan Peoples Party  PPP  had won the exclusive mandate in the four provinces of Pakistan  but none in the East Pakistan  The Pakistan Muslim League  PML  led by Nurul Amin was the only party to have representation from all over the country  though it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government  The Awami League had 160 seats  all won from the East Pakistan  the socialist PPP had secured 81  the conservative PML had 10 seats in the National Assembly  The general elections s results truly reflected the ugly political reality  the division of the Pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarization of the country between the two states  East Pakistan and Pakistan   In political terms  therefore  Pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result  Series of bilateral talks between PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced to results and were unable to come to an agreement of transfer of power from to East Pakistan s representatives on the basis of the Six Point programme  In Pakistan  the people had felt that the Six point agenda was a step towards secession  In recent media reports  it since emerged that Mujib met Indian diplomats in London according to his daughter in 1969 from where he agreed to secede from Pakistan  4 2  Crackdown in East Pakistan  While  the political deadlock remains between the Awami League  PPP  and the military government after the general elections in 1970  During this time  Yahya began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in East Pakistan  On 25 March 1971  President Yahya initiated the Searchlight in order to restore the writ of the government  Partially successful  the situation in East Pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings now was too wide to be bridged  Agitation was now transformed into a vicious insurgency as Bengali elements of Pakistan armed forces and Police mutinied and formed Bangladesh Forces along with common people of all classes to launch both unconventional and hit and run operations   The Searchlight ordered by Yahya was a planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Armed Forces to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971 Ordered by the government in Pakistan  this was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz which had been launched in November 1970   The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971  and then eliminating all opposition  political or military  within one month  The prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by Pakistani planners  The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid May   The total number of people killed in East Pakistan is not known with any degree of accuracy  Bangladeshi authorities claim that 3 million people were killed  while the Hamoodur Rahman Commission  an official Pakistan Government investigation  put the figure as low as 26 000 civilian casualties  According to Sarmila Bose  between 50 000 and 100 000 combatants and civilians were killed by both sides during the war  A 2008 British Medical Journal study by Ziad Obermeyer  Christopher J  L  Murray  and Emmanuela Gakidou estimated that up to 269 000 civilians died as a result of the conflict  the authors note that this is far higher than a previous estimate of 58 000 from Uppsala University and the Peace Research Institute  Oslo  According to Serajur Rahman  the official Bangladeshi estimate of  3 lahks   300 000  was wrongly translated into English as 3 million   Khan arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on charges of Sedition and appointed Brigadier Rahimuddin Khan  later General  to preside over a special tribunal dealing with Mujib s case  Rahimuddin awarded Mujib the death sentence  and President Yahya put the verdict into abeyance  Yahya s crackdown  however  had led to a Bangladesh Liberation War within Pakistan  and eventually drew India into what would extend into the Indo Pakistani War of 1971  The end result was the establishment of Bangladesh as an independent republic  Khan subsequently apologised for his mistakes and voluntarily stepped down   4 3  The US role  The United States had been a major sponsor of President Yahya s military government  as noted in a reference written by Gary Bass in the  The Blood Telegram    President Nixon liked very few people  but he did like General Yahya Khan   Personal initiatives of President Yahya had helped to establish the communication channel between the United States and the China  which would be used to set up the Nixon s trip in 1972   Since 1960  Pakistan was perceived in the United States as an integral bulwark against the globalized Communism in the Cold War  The United States cautiously supported Pakistan during 1971 although congress kept in place an arms embargo  In 1970  India with a heavily socialist economy entered in a a formal alliance with the Soviet Union in August 1971  Moreover  noting that India was using the violence committed by all sides during this war as a pretext for a possible military intervention  they suspected that India had aggressive intentions   Over this period  Henry Kissinger would work to prevent sectarian conflicts in Yemen and Lebanon from devolving into regional wars under President Nixon  The Soviet Union s growing support and influence in the Afghanistan  the Nixon administration used Pakistan to try to deter any further Soviet encroachment in the region  Nixon relayed several written and oral messages to President Yahya  strongly urging him to restrain the use of Pakistan forces  His objective was to prevent a war and safeguard Pakistan s interests  though he feared an Indian invasion of Pakistan that would lead to Indian domination of the subcontinent and strengthen the position of the Soviet Union  Similarly  President Yahya feared that an independent Bangladesh could lead to the disintegration of Pakistan  Indian military support for Bengali guerrillas led to war between India and Pakistan   In 1971  Richard Nixon met with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and did not believe her assertion that she would not invade Pakistan  Nixon did not trust her and even once referred to her as an  old witch   Witness accounts presented by Kissinger pointed out that Nixon made specific proposals to Prime Minister Gandhi on a solution for the crisis  some of which she heard for the first time  including a mutual withdrawal of troops from the Indo East Pakistan borders  Nixon also expressed a wish to fix a time limit with Yahya for political accommodation in East Pakistan  Nixon asserted that India could count on US endeavors to ease the crisis within a short time  But  both Kissinger and Gandhi saide Jayakar maintained  Gandhi did not respond to these proposals  Kissinger noted that she  listened to what was in fact one of Nixon s better presentations with aloof indifference  but  took up none of the points   Jayakar pointed out that Gandhi listened to Nixon  without a single comment  creating an impregnable space so that no real contact was possible   She also refrained from assuring that India would follow Pakistan s suit if it withdrew from India s borders  As a result  the main agenda was  dropped altogether    On 3 December  Yahya preemptively attacked the Indian Air Force and Gandhi retaliated  pushing into East Pakistan  Nixon issued a statement blaming Pakistan for starting the conflict and blaming India for escalating it because he favored a cease fire  The United States was secretly encouraging the shipment of military equipment from Iran  Turkey  and Jordan to Pakistan  reimbursing those countries despite Congressional objections  The US used the threat of an aid cut off to force Pakistan to back down  while its continued military aid to Islamabad prevented India from launching incursions deeper into the country  A cease fire was reached on 16 December  leading to the creation of the independent state of Bangladesh   4 4  Fall from power  When the news of surrender of East Pakistan reaches through the national television  the spontaneous and overwhelming public anger over Pakistan s defeat by Bangladeshi rebels and the Indian Army  followed by the division of Pakistan into two parts boiled into street demonstrations throughout Pakistan  Rumors of an impending coup d état by junior military officers against President Yahya to swept the country  Yahya became the highest ranking casualty of the war  to forestall further unrest  on 20 December 1971 he handed over the presidency and government to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto— the ambitious leader of Pakistan s powerful People s Party   Within hours of Yahya stepping down  President Bhutto reversed JAG s verdict against Mujibur Rehman and instead releasing him to saw him off to London  President Bhutto also signed orders for Yahya s house confinement  the man who imprisoned Mujib in the first place  Both actions produced headlines round the world   5  Death  Yahya remained under the house arrest orders until 1979 when he was released from the custody by martial law administrator General Fazle Haq  He remained out from the public events and died on 10 August 1980 in Rawalpindi  Punjab  Pakistan   6  Notes  7  References  8  Bibliography  9  External links      TIME      Washington Post      Spiegel Online
