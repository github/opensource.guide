Methanol  also known as methyl alcohol  wood alcohol  wood naphtha or wood spirits  is a chemical with the formula CH3OH  often abbreviated MeOH   Methanol acquired the name  wood alcohol  because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood  Modern methanol is produced in a catalytic industrial process directly from carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  and hydrogen   Methanol is the simplest alcohol  and is a light  volatile  colorless  flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol  drinking alcohol   However  unlike ethanol  methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption  At room temperature  it is a polar liquid  and is used as an antifreeze  solvent  fuel  and as a denaturant for ethanol  It is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction   Methanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria  and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment  As a result  there is a small fraction of methanol vapor in the atmosphere  Over the course of several days  atmospheric methanol is oxidized with the help of sunlight to carbon dioxide and water   Methanol burns in oxygen  including open air  forming carbon dioxide and water   Methanol ingested in large quantities is metabolized to formic acid or formate salts  which is poisonous to the central nervous system  and may cause blindness  coma  and death  Because of these toxic properties  methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses  This addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol  commonly known as  denatured alcohol  or  methylated spirit   from liquor excise taxation in the US and some other countries   1  Occurrence  1 1  Human metabolite  Methanol is poisonous to the central nervous system and may cause blindness  coma  and death  However  in small amounts  methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal  healthy human individuals  concluded by one study which found a mean of 4 5 ppm in the exhaled breath of the subjects  The mean endogenous methanol in humans of 0 45 g d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit  One kilogram of apple produces up to 1 4 gram methanol   2  Toxicity  Methanol has a high toxicity in humans  If as little as 10 mL of pure methanol is ingested  for example  it can break down into formic acid  which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve  and 30 mL is potentially fatal  although the median lethal dose is typically 100 mL  3 4 fl oz   i e  1–2 mL kg body weight of pure methanol   Reference dose for methanol is 0 5 mg kg day  Toxic effects take hours to start  and effective antidotes can often prevent permanent damage  Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol  the alcohol in beverages   it is difficult to differentiate between the two  such is also the case with denatured alcohol   However  there are cases of methanol resistance  such as that of Mike Malloy  who was the victim of a failed murder attempt by methanol in the early 1930s   Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms  First  methanol  whether it enters the body by ingestion  inhalation  or absorption through the skin  can be fatal due to its CNS depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning  Second  in a process of toxication  it is metabolized to formic acid  which is present as the formate ion  via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver  Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase  ADH  and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid  formate  via aldehyde dehydrogenase  ALDH   The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely  with no detectable formaldehyde remaining  Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase  causing the symptoms of hypoxia at the cellular level  and also causing metabolic acidosis  among a variety of other metabolic disturbances   Methanol poisoning can be treated with the antidotes ethanol or fomepizole  Both drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition  so it is excreted by the kidneys rather than being transformed into toxic metabolites  Further treatment may include giving sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis  and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration can be used to remove methanol and formate from the blood  Folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate   The initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include central nervous system depression  headache  dizziness  nausea  lack of coordination  and confusion  Sufficiently large doses can cause unconsciousness and death  The initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms resulting from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol  Once the initial symptoms have passed  a second set of symptoms arises  10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure to methanol  including blurring or complete loss of vision  acidosis and putaminal hemorrhages  an uncommon but serious complication  These symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of formate in the blood  and may progress to death by respiratory failure  Physical examination may show tachypnea  and ophthalmologic examination may show dilated pupils with hyperemia of the optic disc and retinal edema  Small amounts of methanol are produced by the metabolism of food and are generally harmless  being metabolized quickly and completely   Ethanol is sometimes denatured  adulterated   and made poisonous  by the addition of methanol  The result is known as methylated spirit   meths   British use  or  metho   Australian slang   These are not to be confused with  meth   a common abbreviation for methamphetamine  and an abbreviation for methadone in Britain   3  Applications  Methanol  a common laboratory solvent  is especially useful for HPLC  UV VIS spectroscopy  and LCMS due to its low UV cutoff   3 1  Feedstock  The largest use of methanol by far is in making other chemicals  About 40% of methanol is converted to formaldehyde  and from there into products as diverse as plastics  plywood  paints  explosives  and permanent press textiles   Also in the early 1970s  a methanol to gasoline process was developed by Mobil for producing gasoline ready for use in vehicles  One such industrial facility was built at Motunui in New Zealand in the 1980s  In the 1990s  large amounts of methanol were used in the United States to produce the gasoline additive methyl tert butyl ether  MTBE   While MTBE is no longer marketed in the U S   it is still widely used in other parts of the world  In addition to direct use as a fuel  methanol  or less commonly  ethanol  is used as a component in the transesterification of triglycerides to yield a form of biodiesel   Other chemical derivatives of methanol include dimethyl ether  which has replaced chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol spray propellant  and acetic acid  Dimethyl ether  DME  also can be blended with liquified petroleum gas  LPG  for home heating and cooking  and can be used as a diesel replacement for transportation fuel   Methanol to Olefins Methanol to Propylene  MTO MTP   among others processes such as  Metathesis  Propane Dehydrogenation  PDH   High Severity FCC  and Olefins Cracking  is a new and novel lower cost chemical process for on purpose propylene production technology of high interest to the petrochemical marketplace  to supply the tight market for propylene   The market became tight because of the ethane prices falling in the USA  due to the exploration of shale gas reserves  The low price ethylene produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in North America a feedstock advantage  Such change has put naphtha fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position  with many of them shutting down or revamping to use ethane as feedstock  Nevertheless  the propylene output rates from ethane fed crackers are negligible   3 2  Fuel for vehicles  Methanol is used on a limited basis to fuel internal combustion engines  Pure methanol is required by rule to be used in Champcars  Monster Trucks  USAC sprint cars  as well as midgets  modifieds  etc    and other dirt track series  such as World of Outlaws  and Motorcycle Speedway  Methanol is also used  as the primary fuel ingredient since the late 1940s  in the powerplants for radio control  control line and free flight airplanes  as methanol is required in the engines that primarily power them   cars and trucks  from such an engine s use of a platinum filament glow plug being able to ignite the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction  Drag racers and mud racers  as well as heavily modified tractor pullers  also use methanol as their primary fuel source  Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and  until the end of the 2006 season  all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run methanol  Mud racers have mixed methanol with gasoline with nitrous oxide to produce more power than mixing gasoline and nitrous oxide alone   One of the potential drawbacks of using high concentrations of methanol  and other alcohols  such as ethanol  in fuel is the corrosivity to some metals of methanol  particularly to aluminium  Methanol  although a weak acid  attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminum from corrosion   The resulting methoxide salts are soluble in methanol  resulting in a clean aluminium surface  which is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen  Also  the methanol can act as an oxidizer   This reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of CH3OH is negligible  Concerns with methanol s corrosivity have been addressed by using methanol compatible materials  and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors   When produced from wood or other organic materials  the resulting organic methanol  bioalcohol  has been suggested as renewable alternative to petroleum based hydrocarbons  Low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles  with the use of proper cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors   Methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation  The chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to present internal combustion engines with a minimum of modification in both engines and infrastructure to store and deliver liquid fuel   3 3  Government policy  The European Fuel Quality Directive allows up to 3% methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blending in gasoline sold in Europe  China uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in both low level blends used in existing vehicles  and as high level blends in vehicles designed to accommodate the use of methanol fuels   In the USA in 2011  the Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011 was introduced in the US Congress to encourage car manufacturers to warrant their cars to burn methanol as a fuel in addition to gasoline and ethanol  The bill is being championed by the Open Fuel Standard Coalition   3 4  Other applications  Methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol  the product being known as  denatured alcohol  or  methylated spirit   This was commonly used during the Prohibition to discourage consumption of bootlegged liquor  and ended up causing several deaths   Methanol is also used as a solvent  and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid   In some wastewater treatment plants  a small amount of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria  which convert nitrates to nitrogen to reduce the nitrification of sensitive aquifers   During World War II  methanol was used as a fuel in several German military rocket designs  under the name M Stoff  and in a roughly 50 50 mixture with hydrazine  known as C Stoff   Methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s   Methanol is used as a denaturing agent in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis   Direct methanol fuel cells are unique in their low temperature  atmospheric pressure operation  allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree  This  combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol  may open the possibility of fuel cell powered consumer electronics  such as for laptop computers and mobile phones   Methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves  Methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner  so alcohol stoves are often very simple  sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel  This lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness  Similarly  the alcohol can also be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling  as with the brand  Sterno    Methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as water methanol injection   3 5  Energy carrier  Methanol is also useful as an energy carrier  It is easier to store than hydrogen  burns cleaner than fossil fuels  and decomposes to water and carbon dioxide if spilled   3 6  Safety in automotive fuels  Pure methanol has been used in open wheel auto racing since the mid 1960s  Unlike petroleum fires  methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water  A methanol based fire burns invisibly  unlike gasoline  which burns with a visible flame  If a fire occurs on the track  there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers  but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression  The decision to permanently switch to methanol in American IndyCar racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the 1964 Indianapolis 500  which killed drivers Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald  In 2007 IndyCars switched to ethanol   Methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic  oxygen present  and anaerobic  oxygen absent  environments  Methanol will not persist in the environment  The half life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days  while many common gasoline components have half lives in the hundreds of days  such as benzene at 10–730 days   Since methanol is miscible with water and biodegradable  it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater  surface water  air or soil   4  Production  4 1  From synthesis gas  Carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol  Today  the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper  zinc oxide  and alumina first used by ICI in 1966  At 5–10 MPa  50–100 atm  and 250 °C  it can catalyze the production of methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen with high selectivity   99 8%    It is worth noting that the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three moles of hydrogen gas for every mole of carbon monoxide  while the methanol synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide  One way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject carbon dioxide into the methanol synthesis reactor  where it  too  reacts to form methanol according to the equation   Some chemists believe that the certain catalysts synthesize methanol using CO2 as an intermediary  and consuming CO only indirectly   where the H2O byproduct is recycled via the water gas shift reaction  This gives an overall reaction  which is the same as listed above   4 2  From methane  The direct catalytic conversion of methane to methanol using Cu zeolites or other catalysts is an alternative process for the efficient production of methanol  This is currently an active field of research  however there are challenges including lifetime of the catalysts and use of affordable reactants to oxidise the methane   4 3  From carbon dioxide  Methanol has been generated directly from carbon dioxide in solution using copper oxide  CuO  nanorods coated by cuprous oxide  Cu2O  and energy from  simulated  sunlight  The process operated with 95% electrochemical efficiency and is claimed to be scalable to industrial size   4 4  Feedstocks  4 4 1  Production of synthesis gas  Originally  synthesis gas for the production of methanol came from coal  Today  synthesis gas is most commonly produced from the methane component in natural gas  because natural gas contains hydrogen  Three processes are commercially practiced  At moderate pressures of 4 MPa  40 atm  and high temperatures  around 850 °C   methane reacts with steam on a nickel catalyst to produce syngas according to the chemical equation   This reaction  commonly called steam methane reforming or SMR  is endothermic  and the heat transfer limitations place limits on the size of and pressure in the catalytic reactors used  Methane can also undergo partial oxidation with molecular oxygen  at atmospheric pressure  to produce syngas  as the following equation shows   This reaction is exothermic  and the heat given off can be used in situ to drive the steam methane reforming reaction  When the two processes are combined  it is referred to as autothermal reforming  The high pressures and high temperatures needed for steam reforming require a greater capital investment in equipment than is needed for a simple partial oxidation process  however  the energy efficiency of steam reforming is higher than for partial oxidation  unless the waste heat from partial oxidation is used   4 4 1 1  Stoichiometry adjustment  Stoichiometry for methanol production requires the ratio of H2   CO to equal 2  The partial oxidation process yields a ratio of 2  and the steam reforming process yields a ratio of 3  The H2   CO ratio can be lowered to some extent by the reverse water gas shift reaction   to provide the appropriate stoichiometry for methanol synthesis   4 4 1 2  Alternate feedstock materials  Although natural gas is the most economical and widely used feedstock for methanol production  many other feedstocks can be used to produce syngas via steam reforming  Steam reformed coal is sometimes used as a feedstock for methanol production  particularly in China  In addition  mature technologies available for biomass gasification are being used for methanol production  For instance  woody biomass can be gasified to water gas  a hydrogen rich syngas   by introducing a blast of steam in a blast furnace  The water gas   syngas can then be synthesized to methanol using standard methods  The net process is carbon neutral  since the CO2 byproduct is required to produce biomass via photosynthesis  Using a composition for wood of 50% carbon  42% oxygen  6% hydrogen we can represent wood with the formula C11H16O7  we could also use C8H12O5   Then some combination of the following two formal reactions will occur   5  Quality specifications and analysis  5 1  Methanol for laboratory use  Methanol is available commercially in various purity grades for fine chemicals  1  “Synthesis” quality  corresponding to normal commercial methanol  2  Certified analytical quality 3  Extremely pure qualities for semiconductor manufacture  5 2  Commercial methanol  In addition to laboratory grades  commercial methanol is generally classified according to ASTM purity grades A and AA  Methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to Grade AA  In addition to water  typical impurities include acetone  which is very difficult to separate by distillation  and ethanol  When methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transport other substances  contamination by the previous cargo must be expected  Comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient  quick test method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded Traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances  as well as a large number of other compounds  can be detected  Further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range  density  permanganate number  turbidity  color index  and acid number  More comprehensive tests include water determination according to the Karl Fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts  However  the latter is relatively expensive and time consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present   6  History  In their embalming process  the ancient Egyptians used a mixture of substances  including methanol  which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood  Pure methanol  however  was first isolated in 1661 by Robert Boyle  when he produced it via the distillation of buxus  boxwood   It later became known as  pyroxylic spirit   In 1834  the French chemists Jean Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot determined its elemental composition   They also introduced the word  methylene  to organic chemistry  forming it from Greek methy    wine  + hȳlē   wood  patch of trees   with Greek language errors   wood  substance    Greek xylon  was intended  and the components are in the wrong order for Greek  The term  methyl  was derived in about 1840 by back formation from  methylene   and was then applied to describe  methyl alcohol   This was shortened to  methanol  in 1892 by the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature  The suffix  yl used in organic chemistry to form names of carbon groups  was extracted from the word  methyl    In 1923  the German chemists Alwin Mittasch and Mathias Pier  working for BASF  developed a means to convert synthesis gas  a mixture of carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  and hydrogen  into methanol  A patent was filed 12 January 1926  reference no  1 569 775   This process used a chromium and manganese oxide catalyst  and required extremely vigorous conditions—pressures ranging from 50 to 220 atm  and temperatures up to 450 °C  Modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts  commonly copper  capable of operating at lower pressures  The modern low pressure methanol  LPM  was developed by ICI in the late 1960s with the technology now owned by Johnson Matthey  which is a leading licensor of methanol technology   Methanol is one of the most heavily traded chemical commodities in the world  with an estimated global demand of around 27 to 29 million metric tons  In recent years  production capacity has expanded considerably  with new plants coming on stream in South America  China and the Middle East  the latter based on access to abundant supplies of methane gas  Even though nameplate production capacity  coal based  in China has grown significantly  operating rates are estimated to be as low as 50 to 60%  No new production capacity is scheduled to come on stream until 2015   The main applications for methanol are the production of formaldehyde  used in construction and wooden boarding   acetic acid  basis for a o  PET bottles   MTBE  fuel component and replacement for the very volatile diethyl ether  and more recently for the formation of methyl esters in the production of bio diesel  In China  demand is expected to grow exponentially  not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications  but accelerated by new applications  such as direct blending  with gasoline   Methanol To Olefins  e g  propylene  and DME  Methanol can also be used to produce gasoline   The use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s due to its availability  low cost  and environmental benefits  By the mid 1990s  over 20 000 methanol  flexible fuel vehicles  capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the U S  In addition  low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in Europe during much of the 1980s and early 1990s  Automakers stopped building methanol FFVs by the late 1990s  switching their attention to ethanol fueled vehicles  While the methanol FFV program was a technical success  rising methanol pricing in the mid  to late 1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished the interest in methanol fuels   In 2006  astronomers using the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank Observatory discovered a large cloud of methanol in space  288 billion miles across   7  See also  Methanol  data page   Methanol epidemic
