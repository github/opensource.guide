Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food  Humans are omnivorous  and have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times  The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens  sheep  fish  seafood  pigs and cattle  and eventually their use in meat production on an industrial scale   Meat is mainly composed of water and protein  and is usually eaten together with other food  It is edible raw  but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways  Unprocessed meat will spoil within hours or days  Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi  which are borne by the animal itself  by the people handling the meat  and by their implements   Meat consumption varies worldwide  depending on cultural or religious preferences  as well as economic conditions  Vegetarians choose not to eat meat because of ethical  economic  environmental  religious or health concerns that are associated with meat production and consumption   Most often  meat refers to skeletal muscle and associated fat and other tissues  but it may also describe other edible tissues such as offal  Conversely  meat is sometimes used in a more restrictive sense – the flesh of mammalian species  pigs  cattle  lambs  etc   raised and prepared for human consumption  to the exclusion of fish  other seafood  poultry or other animals   1  Etymology  The word meat comes from the Old English word mete  which referred to food in general  The term is related to mad in Danish  mat in Swedish and Norwegian  and matur in Icelandic and Faroese  which also mean  food   The word mete also exists in Old Frisian  and to a lesser extent  modern West Frisian  to denote important food  differentiating it from swiets  sweets  and dierfied  animal feed    2  History  Paleontological evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of even the earliest humans  Early hunter gatherers depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as bison and deer   The domestication of animals  of which we have evidence dating back to the end of the last glacial period  c  10 000 BC   allowed the systematic production of meat and the breeding of animals with a view to improving meat production  The animals which are now the principal sources of meat were domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations   Sheep  originating from western Asia  were domesticated with the help of dogs prior to the establishment of settled agriculture  likely as early as the 8th millennium BC  Several breeds of sheep were established in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt by 3500–3000 BC  Presently  more than 200 sheep breeds exist   Cattle were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was established about 5000 BC  and several breeds were established by 2500 BC  Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups Bos taurus  European cattle  and Bos indicus  zebu   both descended from the now extinct aurochs  The breeding of beef cattle  cattle optimized for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for draught or dairy purposes  began in the middle of the 18th century   Domestic pigs  which are descended from wild boars  are known to have existed about 2500 BC in modern day Hungary and in Troy  earlier pottery from Jericho and Egypt depicts wild pigs  Pork sausages and hams were of great commercial importance in Greco Roman times  Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products  Other animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh  The type of meat consumed varies much between different cultures  changes over time  depending on factors such as tradition and the availability of the animals  The amount and kind of meat consumed also varies by income  both between countries and within a given country   Horses are commonly eaten in countries such as France Italy  Germany and Japan  Horses and other large mammals such as reindeer were hunted during the Late Paleolithic in western Europe   Dogs are consumed in China  South Korea and Vietnam  Dogs are also occasionally eaten in the Arctic regions  Historically  dog meat has been consumed in various part of the world  such as Hawaii  Japan  Switzerland and Mexico   Cats are consumed in Southern China and Peru   Guinea pigs are raised for their flesh in the Andes   Whales and dolphins are hunted  partly for their flesh  in Japan  Alaska  Siberia  Canada  the Faroe Islands  Greenland  Iceland  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and by two small communities in Indonesia  Modern agriculture employs a number of techniques  such as progeny testing  to make animals evolve rapidly to acquire the qualities desired by meat producers  For instance  in the wake of well publicised health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s  the fat content of United Kingdom beef  pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades  due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of butchery  Methods of genetic engineering aimed at improving the meat production qualities of animals are now also becoming available   Even though it is a very old industry  meat production continues to be shaped strongly by the evolving demands of customers  The trend towards selling meat in pre packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle  which are better suited to producing such cuts  Even more animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed  especially the more agile and mobile species  whose muscles tend to be developed better than those of cattle  sheep or pigs  Examples are the various antelope species  the zebra  water buffalo and camel  as well as non mammals  such as the crocodile  emu and ostrich  Another important trend in contemporary meat production is organic farming which  while providing no organoleptic benefit to meat so produced  meets an increasing demand for organic meat   3  Growth and development of meat animals  Agricultural science has identified several factors bearing on the growth and development of meat in animals   3 1  Genetics  Several economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some degree  see the table to the right  and can thus be selected for by animal breeding  In cattle  certain growth features are controlled by recessive genes which have not so far been controlled  complicating breeding  One such trait is dwarfism  another is the doppelender or  double muscling  condition  which causes muscle hypertrophy and thereby increases the animal s commercial value  Genetic analysis continues to reveal the genetic mechanisms that control numerous aspects of the endocrine system and  through it  meat growth and quality   Genetic engineering techniques can shorten breeding programmes significantly because they allow for the identification and isolation of genes coding for desired traits  and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal genome  To enable such manipulation  research is ongoing    to map the entire genome of sheep  cattle and pigs  Some research has already seen commercial application  For instance  a recombinant bacterium has been developed which improves the digestion of grass in the rumen of cattle  and some specific features of muscle fibres have been genetically altered   Experimental reproductive cloning of commercially important meat animals such as sheep  pig or cattle has been successful  The multiple asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits can thus be anticipated  although this is not yet practical on a commercial scale   3 2  Environment  Heat regulation in livestock is of great economic significance  because mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature  Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it  Depending on their size  body shape and insulation through tissue and fur  some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others  e g  cattle  a broad one  Static magnetic fields  for reasons still unknown  also retard animal development   3 3  Nutrition  The quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal s plane of nutrition  i e   whether it is over  or underfed  Scientists disagree  however  about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition   The composition of the diet  especially the amount of protein provided  is also an important factor regulating animal growth  Ruminants  which may digest cellulose  are better adapted to poor quality diets  but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high quality protein if supplied in excess  Because producing high quality protein animal feed is expensive  see also Environmental impact below   several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein  These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen  the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates  or the partial conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action   In plant feed  environmental factors influence the availability of crucial nutrients or micronutrients  a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments  In Australia  for instance  where the soil contains limited phosphate  cattle are being fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production  Also in Australia  cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture  this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil  Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals  for instance  sodium fluoracetate  found in some African and Australian plants  kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism  Certain man made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat  potentially poisoning consumers   3 4  Human intervention  Meat producers may seek to improve the fertility of female animals through the administration of gonadotrophic or ovulation inducing hormones  In pig production  sow infertility is a common problem  possibly due to excessive fatness  No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals  Artificial insemination is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality  and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females   Growth hormones  particularly anabolic agents such as steroids  are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals  This practice has given rise to the beef hormone controversy  an international trade dispute  It may also decrease the tenderness of meat  although research on this is inconclusive  and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh  Where castration is used to improve control over male animals  its side effects are also counteracted by the administration of hormones   Sedatives may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain  The feeding of antibiotics to certain animals has been shown to improve growth rates also  This practice is particularly prevalent in the USA  but has been banned in the EU  partly because it causes antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microorganisms   4  Biochemical composition  Numerous aspects of the biochemical composition of meat vary in complex ways depending on the species  breed  sex  age  plane of nutrition  training and exercise of the animal  as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved  Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat   4 1  Main constituents  Adult mammalian muscle flesh consists of roughly 75 percent water  19 percent protein  2 5 percent intramuscular fat  1 2 percent carbohydrates and 2 3 percent other soluble non protein substances  These include nitrogenous compounds  such as amino acids  and inorganic substances such as minerals   Muscle proteins are either soluble in water  sarcoplasmic proteins  about 11 5 percent of total muscle mass  or in concentrated salt solutions  myofibrillar proteins  about 5 5 percent of mass   There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins  Most of them – the glycolytic enzymes – are involved in the glycolytic pathway  i e   the conversion of stored energy into muscle power  The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins  myosin and actin  are responsible for the muscle s overall structure  The remaining protein mass consists of connective tissue  collagen and elastin  as well as organelle tissue   Fat in meat can be either adipose tissue  used by the animal to store energy and consisting of  true fats   esters of glycerol with fatty acids   or intramuscular fat  which contains considerable quantities of phospholipids and of unsaponifiable constituents such as cholesterol   4 2  Red and white meat  Meat can be broadly classified as  red  or  white  depending on the concentration of myoglobin in muscle fibre  When myoglobin is exposed to oxygen  reddish oxymyoglobin develops  making myoglobin rich meat appear red  The redness of meat depends on species  animal age  and fibre type  Red meat contains more narrow muscle fibres that tend to operate over long periods without rest  while white meat contains more broad fibres that tend to work in short fast bursts   Generally  the meat of adult mammals such as cows  sheep  goats  and horses is considered red  while chicken and turkey breast meat is considered white   5  Nutritional information  All muscle tissue is very high in protein  containing all of the essential amino acids  and in most cases is a good source of zinc  vitamin B12  selenium  phosphorus  niacin  vitamin B6  choline  riboflavin and iron  Several forms of meat are also high in vitamin K  Muscle tissue is very low in carbohydrates and does not contain dietary fiber  The fat content of meat can vary widely depending on the species and breed of animal  the way in which the animal was raised  including what it was fed  the anatomical part of the body  and the methods of butchering and cooking  Wild animals such as deer are typically leaner than farm animals  leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison  Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat   The table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of meat  While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and carbohydrates  there is a very wide range of fat content   6  Production  Meat is produced by killing an animal and cutting flesh out of it  These procedures are called slaughter and butchery  respectively  There is ongoing research into producing meat in vitro  that is  outside of animals   Attesting to the long history of meat consumption in human civilizations  ritual slaughter has become part of the practice of several religions  These rituals  as well as other pre industrial meat production methods such as these used by indigenous peoples  are not detailed here  This section will instead provide an overview of contemporary industrialized meat production in dedicated slaughterhouses from cattle  sheep and pigs   6 1  Transport  Upon reaching a predetermined age or weight  livestock are usually transported en masse to the slaughterhouse  Depending on its length and circumstances  this may exert stress and injuries on the animals  and some may die en route  Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat  In particular  the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and glycogen  and their pH fails to attain acidic values  all of which results in poor meat quality  Consequently  and also due to campaigning by animal welfare groups  laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of livestock transports   6 2  Slaughter  Animals are usually slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated  bled out   Death results from the one or the other procedure  depending on the methods employed  Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide  shooting them with a gun or a captive bolt pistol  or shocking them with electric current  In most forms of ritual slaughter  stunning is not allowed   Draining as much blood as possible from the carcase is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms  The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the carotid artery and the jugular vein in cattle and sheep  and the anterior vena cava in pigs   6 3  Dressing and cutting  After exsanguination  the carcass is dressed  that is  the head  feet  hide  except hogs and some veal   excess fat  viscera and offal are removed  leaving only bones and edible muscle  Cattle and pig carcases  but not those of sheep  are then split in half along the mid ventral axis  and the carcase is cut into wholesale pieces  The dressing and cutting sequence  long a province of manual labor  is progressively being fully automated   6 4  Conditioning  Under hygienic conditions and without other treatment  meat can be stored at above its freezing point  –1 5 °C  for about six weeks without spoilage  during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor   During the first day after death  glycolysis continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5 5  The remaining glycogen  about 18 g per kg  is believed to increase the water holding capacity and tenderness of the flesh when cooked  Rigor mortis sets in a few hours after death as ATP is used up  causing actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin and lowering the meat s water holding capacity  causing it to lose water   weep    In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position  actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross bond  resulting in meat that is tough on cooking – hence again the need to prevent pre slaughter stress in the animal   Over time  the muscle proteins denature in varying degree  with the exception of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue  and rigor mortis resolves  Because of these changes  the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor  but tough when cooked during rigor  As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures  its iron oxidates  which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat  Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning  Hypoxanthine  a breakdown product of ATP  contributes to the meat s flavor and odor  as do other products of the discomposition of muscle fat and protein   6 5  Additives  When meat is industrially processed in preparation of consumption  it may be enriched with additives to protect or modify its flavor or color  to improve its tenderness  juiciness or cohesiveness  or to aid with its preservation  Meat additives include the following   Salt is the most frequently used additive in meat processing  It imparts flavor but also inhibits microbial growth  extends the product s shelf life and helps emulsifying finely processed products  such as sausages  Ready to eat meat products normally contain about 1 5 to 2 5 percent salt   Nitrite is used in curing meat to stabilize the meat s color and flavor  and inhibits the growth of spore forming microorganisms such as C  botulinum  The use of nitrite s precursor nitrate is now limited to a few products such as dry sausage  prosciutto or parma ham   Phosphates used in meat processing are normally alkaline polyphosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphate  They are used to increase the water binding and emulsifying ability of meat proteins  but also limit lipid oxidation and flavor loss  and reduce microbial growth   Erythorbate or its equivalent ascorbic acid  vitamin C  is used to stabilize the color of cured meat   Sweeteners such as sugar or corn syrup impart a sweet flavor  bind water and assist surface browning during cooking in the Maillard reaction   Seasonings impart or modify flavor  They include spices or oleoresins extracted from them  herbs  vegetables and essential oils   Flavorings such as monosodium glutamate impart or strengthen a particular flavor   Tenderizers break down collagens to make the meat more palatable for consumption  They include proteolytic enzymes  acids  salt and phosphate   Dedicated antimicrobials include lactic  citric and acetic acid  sodium diacetate  acidified sodium chloride or calcium sulfate  cetylpyridinium chloride  activated lactoferrin  sodium or potassium lactate  or bacteriocins such as nisin   Antioxidants include a wide range of chemicals that limit lipid oxidation  which creates an undesirable  off flavor   in precooked meat products   Acidifiers  most often lactic or citric acid  can impart a tangy or tart flavor note  extend shelf life  tenderize fresh meat or help with protein denaturation and moisture release in dried meat  They substitute for the process of natural fermentation that acidifies some meat products such as hard salami or prosciutto   7  Spoilage and preservation  The spoilage of meat occurs  if untreated  in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing  poisonous or infectious  Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi  which are borne by the animal itself  by the people handling the meat  and by their implements  Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time – though not indefinitely – if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing  and if appropriate food safety  food preservation and food storage procedures are applied  Without the application of preservatives and stabilizers  the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing  leading to an objectionable taste known as warmed over flavor   8  Methods of preparation  Fresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption  or be processed  that is  treated for longer term preservation and later consumption  possibly after further preparation  Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence  commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused structural coloration and diffraction of the light  A common additive to processed meats  both for preservation and because it prevents discoloring  is sodium nitrite  which  however  is also a source of health concerns  because it may form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated   Meat is prepared in many ways  as steaks  in stews  fondue  or as dried meat like beef jerky  It may be ground then formed into patties  as hamburgers or croquettes   loaves  or sausages  or used in loose form  as in  sloppy joe  or Bolognese sauce   Some meat is cured by smoking  which is the process of flavoring  cooking  or preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant materials  most often wood  In Europe  alder is the traditional smoking wood  but oak is more often used now  and beech to a lesser extent  In North America  hickory  mesquite  oak  pecan  alder  maple  and fruit tree woods are commonly used for smoking  Meat can also be cured by pickling  preserving in salt or brine  see salted meat and other curing methods   Other kinds of meat are marinated and barbecued  or simply boiled  roasted  or fried   Meat is generally eaten cooked  but many recipes call for raw beef  veal or fish  tartare   Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef or horse meat  Meat is often spiced or seasoned  particularly with meat products such as sausages  Meat dishes are usually described by their source  animal and part of body  and method of preparation  e g   a beef rib    Meat is a typical base for making sandwiches  Popular varieties of sandwich meat include ham  pork  salami and other sausages  and beef  such as steak  roast beef  corned beef  pepperoni  and pastrami  Meat can also be molded or pressed  common for products that include offal  such as haggis and scrapple  and canned   9  Issues  Meat is part of the human diet in most cultures  Many people  however  choose not to eat meat  this is referred to as vegetarianism  or any food made from animals  veganism   The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food  health concerns  environmental concerns or religious dietary laws   9 1  Ethics of eating meat  Ethical issues regarding the consumption of meat can include objections to the act of killing animals or to the agricultural practices used in meat production  Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include animal rights  environmental ethics  or an aversion to inflicting pain or harm on other sentient creatures  Some people  while not vegetarians  refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals  such as cats  dogs  horses  or rabbits  due to cultural or religious taboos  In some cases  specific meats  especially from pigs and cows  are forbidden within religious traditions   Some people eat only the flesh of animals which they believe have not been mistreated  and abstain from the meat of animals reared in factory farms or from particular products such as foie gras and veal  Some people also abstain from milk and its derivatives because the production of veal is a byproduct of the dairy industry  The ethical issues with factory farming relate to the high concentration of animals  animal waste  and the potential for dead animals in a small space  Critics argue that some techniques used in intensive agriculture can be cruel to animals  Foie gras is a food product made of the liver of ducks or geese that has been specially fattened by force feeding them corn  Veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement  have unsuitable flooring  spend their entire lives indoors  experience prolonged sensory  social  and exploratory deprivation  and are more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease   9 2  Religious traditions  The religion of Jainism has always opposed eating meat  and there are also schools of Buddhism  and Hinduism that condemn the eating of meat  Jewish dietary rules  Kashrut  allow certain  kosher  meat and forbid other  treif   Among the numerous laws that form part of kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of unclean animals  such as pork  shellfish  both Mollusca and Crustacea  and most insects  and mixtures of meat and milk  Similar rules apply in Islamic dietary laws  The Quran explicitly forbids meat from animals that die of themselves  blood  the meat of swine  porcine animals  pigs   and animals dedicated to other than Allah  either undedicated or dedicated to idols  which are haram as opposed to halal  In Sikhism only Kutha meat is forbidden and the prescribed method of killing is Jhatka  however there are sects that oppose eating meat   9 3  Health  A study of 400 000 subjects conducted by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and published in 2013 showed  a moderate positive association between processed meat consumption and mortality  in particular due to cardiovascular diseases  but also to cancer    A 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries  The metastudy reported mortality ratios  where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths  for fish eaters to be 0 82  vegetarians to be 0 84  occasional meat eaters to be 0 84  Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1 00   In response to changing prices as well as health concerns about saturated fat and cholesterol  consumers have altered their consumption of various meats  A USDA report points out that consumption of beef in the United States between 1970–1974 and 1990–1994 dropped by 21%  while consumption of chicken increased by 90%  During the same period of time  the price of chicken dropped by 14% relative to the price of beef  In 1995 and 1996  beef consumption increased due to higher supplies and lower prices   9 3 1  Cancer  In recent years  health concerns have been raised about the consumption of meat increasing the risk of cancer  In particular  red meat and processed meat were found to be associated with higher risk of cancers of the lung  esophagus  liver  and colon  among others  although also a reduced risk for some minor type of cancers  Another study found an increase risk of pancreatic cancer for red meat and pork  However that study noted  Carcinogenic substances related to meat preparation methods might be responsible for the positive association  meaning that it is not the meat itself that is the issue but rather the additives That study also suggests that fat and saturated fat are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer  Animal fat  particularly from ruminants  tends to have a higher percentage of saturated fat vs  monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats  with the exception of some tropical plant fats  consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems  The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer  although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption   However  many research papers do not support significant links between meat consumption and various cancers  Key et al  found that  There were no significant differences between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease  stomach cancer  colorectal cancer  lung cancer  breast cancer  prostate cancer or all other causes combined   Truswell reviewed numerous studies  concluding that the relationship of colorectal cancer with meat consumption appeared weaker than the  probable  status it had been given by the World Cancer Research Foundation in 1997  A study by Chao et al   2005  found an apparent association of colorectal cancer with red meat consumption after adjustment for age and energy intake  However  after further adjustment for body mass index  cigarette smoking and other covariates  no association with red meat consumption was found  Alexander conducted a meta analysis which found no association of colorectal cancer with consumption of animal fat or protein  Based on European data  EPIC Oxford study   Key et al  found that incidence of colorectal cancer was somewhat lower among meat eaters than among vegetarians  A study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition found that association between esophageal cancer risk and total and processed meat intake was not statistically significant  The dissimilar findings indicate that caution is needed in considering claims of dietary links to cancer occurrence   9 3 2  Heart disease  The correlation of meat consumption to increased risk of heart disease is controversial  Some studies fail to find a link between red meat consumption and heart disease  although the same study found statistically significant correlation between the consumption of processed meat and cancer   while another study  a survey  conducted in 1960  of 25 153 California Seventh Day Adventists  found that the risk of heart disease is three times greater for 45 64 year old men who eat meat daily  versus those who did not eat meat  A major Harvard University study in 2010 involving over one million people who ate meat found that only processed meat had an adverse risk in relation to coronary heart disease  The study suggests that eating 50g  less than 2oz  of processed meat per day increases risk of coronary heart disease by 42%  and diabetes by 19%  Equivalent levels of fat  including saturated fats  in unprocessed meat  even when eating twice as much per day  did not show any deleterious effects  leading the researchers to suggest that  differences in salt and preservatives  rather than fats  might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats  but not with unprocessed red meats    9 3 3  Bacterial contamination  A 2011 study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half  47%  of the meat and poultry in U S  grocery stores were contaminated with S  aureus  with more than half  52%  of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics   9 3 4  Cooking  Meat can transmit certain diseases  but complete cooking and avoiding recontamination reduces this possibility   Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates heterocyclic amines  HCAs   which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans  Researchers at the National Cancer Institute published results of a study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium well or well done  While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully  the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below creates  negligible amounts  of HCAs  Also  microwaving meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%   Nitrosamines  present in processed and cooked foods  have been noted as being carcinogenic  being linked to colon cancer  Also  toxic compounds called PAHs  or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  present in processed  smoked and cooked foods  are known to be carcinogenic   9 4  Environmental impact  Various environmental effects are associated with meat production  Among these are greenhouse gas emissions  fossil energy use  water use  water quality changes  and effects on grazed ecosystems   Thus  the livestock sector is probably the largest source of water pollution  due to animal wastes  fertilizers  pesticides   contributing to eutrophication  human health problems  and emergence of antibiotic resistance  It accounts also for over 8% of global human water use  It is by far the biggest cause of land use  as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface  It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss  as it causes deforestation  land degradation  pollution  overfishing  and invasions by alien species  It is also responsible for 20% of the world s greenhouse gas emissions  that are the main cause of the current climate change   The occurrence  nature and significance of these effects varies among livestock production systems  Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for some wildlife species  but not for others  Targeted grazing of livestock is used as a food producing alternative to herbicide use in some vegetation management  Meat producing livestock can provide environmental benefits through waste reduction  e g  conversion of human inedible residues of food crops  Manure from meat producing livestock is used as fertilizer  it may be composted before application to food crops  Substitution of animal manures for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant  as between 43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers   9 5  Imitation meat  Various forms of imitation meat have been created for people who wish not to eat meat but still want to taste its flavor and texture  Meat imitates are typically some form of processed soybean  tofu  tempeh   but they can also be based on wheat gluten or even fungi  quorn    9 6  Misidentification  With the rise of complex supply chains  including cold chains  in developed economies  the distance between the farmer or fisherman and customer has grown  increasing the possibility for intentional and unintentional misidentification of meat at various points in the supply chain   In 2013  reports emerged across Europe that products labelled as containing beef actually contained horse meat  In February 2013 a study was published showing that about one third of raw fish are misidentified across the United States   10  See also  Alligator meat  Beef hormone controversy  Bushmeat  Culinary
