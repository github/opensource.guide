is a 1991 comedy anime spoofing the life and culture of otaku  individuals with obsessive interests in media  particularly anime and manga  as well as the history of Gainax  its creators  It is noted for its mix of conventional documentary film styles  with actual film  no less   with a more traditional anime storytelling fashion  It is licensed in the United States by AnimEigo  The DAICON III and IV Opening Animations from the early eighties are also featured in this OVA   1  Plot summary  The main character is a normal Japanese male  Ken Kubo  living quite happily with his girlfriend Yoshiko and being a member of his college s tennis team  until he meets one of his former friends from high school  Tanaka  After Tanaka brings him into his circle of friends  all of them being otaku  too  a female illustrator  an information geek  a martial artist  and a weapons collector   Kubo soon makes the wish to become the Otaking  the King of all the otaku   He manages to create his own model kits  open shops  and even build a factory in China  Later  he loses it all when one of his rivals  who s also married to Yoshiko  who never forgave Kubo for abandoning her  takes control of his enterprise with Tanaka s unwitting aid  But after Kubo and Tanaka make peace  teaming up with hard working artist Misuzu  Kubo and friends successfully take over the anime industry with a magical girl show   Misty May   Once they have reached the peak of their ambitions  Ken and Tanaka create Otakuland  the equivalent of Disneyland for otaku  the story suggests Otakuland to be located in the same city of

converted into a functional spaceship piloted by their old otaku friends  Miraculously rejuvenated  they fly off to space in search of the planet of Otaku   2  A Portrait of an Otaku  A controversial and humorous part of Otaku no Video was the inclusion of live action documentary excerpts  titled  A Portrait of an Otaku   In these segments  the documentary crew would interview an anonymous otaku  typically ashamed at being a fan and whose face are censored with a mosaic and have their voices digitally masked  The mock documentary segments serve as a counterpoint to the anime  while the anime emphasizes the camaradrie  creativity  and dreams of mainstream acceptance of otaku  the mock interviews exaggerate its negative qualities  The subjects run the gamut of the otaku subculture  the interviews cover a cosplayer who now works as a computer programmer and outright denies his cosplay days  even when presented with photographic evidence  but keeps his Char Aznable helmet in his desk drawer  an airsoft otaku  a garage kit otaku  and a shut in who videorecords television programs for trade  but has not actually watched anything he s recorded  The interviews also contain fans who engage in a range of illicit or unsavory activities  such as cel thieves  a pornography fan attempting to manufacture glasses to defeat the mosaic censorship common in Japanese porno videos and who is shown masturbating during the interview  and a computer gamer  who looks like Gainax member Hideaki Anno  obsessed with a character in a hentai computer game  Noriko from Gunbuster who makes a cameo in Gainax s own hentai game  Cybernetic High School    It is believed that all the subjects in the Portrait of An Otaku segments were Gainax employees or connected to Gainax at the time of filming  The first otaku interviewed bore a remarkable resemblance to Toshio Okada  a principal founder in Gainax  in both background and physical appearance  The gaijin otaku  Shon Hernandez  has been confirmed to have been Craig York  who with Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez  whose names were borrowed for the character   were the main staff of General Products USA  an early western branch of Gainax s merchandising in the early 1990s  The interview with  Shon Hernandez  has been a point of contention with Lea Hernandez  who  in an interview with PULP magazine  noted that the interview was unscripted and that Craig York had been fairly sincere in his thoughts and had felt that Gainax insulted their American members  In the interview  the words spoken by Shon Hernandez in the background are noticeably different from what is shown on screen via subtitle  which is based on the Japanese voiceover  translation     At FanimeCon 2003  Hiroshi Sato  an animator and another Gainax member  mentioned that he had been in one of the interviews in Otaku no Video  In Otaku no Video  the garage kit otaku was given the pseudonym  Sato Hiroshi  for the interview   3  Characters                                                     4  Production and Release  Since Otaku no Video was partially based in the personal life of the original creators of Gainax  who started their careers as otaku
