Structural biology is a branch of molecular biology  biochemistry  and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules  especially proteins and nucleic acids  how they acquire the structures they have  and how alterations in their structures affect their function  This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells  and because it is only by coiling into specific three dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions  This architecture  the  tertiary structure  of molecules  depends in a complicated way on the molecules  basic composition  or  primary structures    Biomolecules are too small to see in detail even with the most advanced light microscopes  The methods that structural biologists use to determine their structures generally involve measurements on vast numbers of identical molecules at the same time  These methods include   Mass spectrometry  Macromolecular crystallography  Proteolysis  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins  NMR   Electron paramagnetic resonance  EPR   Cryo electron microscopy  cryo EM   Multiangle light scattering  Small angle scattering  Ultra fast laser spectroscopy  Dual Polarisation Interferometry and circular dichroism Most often researchers use them to study the  native states  of macromolecules  But variations on these methods are also used to watch nascent or denatured molecules assume or reassume their native states  See protein folding   A third approach that structural biologists take to understanding structure is bioinformatics to look for patterns among the diverse sequences that give rise to particular shapes  Researchers often can deduce aspects of the structure of integral membrane proteins based on the membrane topology predicted by hydrophobicity analysis  See protein structure prediction   In the past few years it has become possible for highly accurate physical molecular models to complement the in silico study of biological structures  Examples of these models can be found in the PDB   1  See also  Primary structure  Secondary structure  Tertiary structure  Quaternary structure  Structural domain  Structural motif  Protein subunit  Molecular model  Cooperativity  Chaperonin  Structural genomics  Stereochemistry  Resolution  electron density   Proteopedia The collaborative  3D encyclopedia of proteins and other molecules   Protein structure prediction  2  External links
