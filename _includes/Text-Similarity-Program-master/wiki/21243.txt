Nortel Networks Corporation  formerly known as Northern Telecom Limited and sometimes known simply as Nortel  was a multinational telecommunications and data networking equipment manufacturer headquartered in Mississauga  Ontario  Canada  It was founded in Montreal  Quebec in 1895  At its height  Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX   employing 94 500 worldwide   On January 14  2009  Nortel filed for protection from its creditors in the United States  Canada  and the United Kingdom  in order to restructure its debt and financial obligations  In June 2009  the company announced it would cease operations and sell off all of its business units  The period of bankruptcy protection was extended to February 2  2013  As part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the United States  Nortel Networks Inc  publishes monthly operating reports outlining cash receipts and disbursements   1  History  1 1  Origins  Alexander Graham Bell conceived the technical aspects of the telephone and invented it in July 1874  while residing with his parents at their farm in Tutela Heights  on the outskirts of Brantford  Ontario  He later refined its design at Brantford after producing his first working prototype in Boston  Canada s first telephone factory  created by James Cowherd of Brantford  was a three story brick building that soon started manufacturing telephones for the Bell System  leading to the city s style as The Telephone City   After Cowherd s death in 1881 which resulted in the closure of his Brantford factory  a mechanical production department was created within the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and production of Canadian telephones and telephone equipment was transferred to Montreal in 1882  due to restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the United States  In addition to phones  four years later  the department started manufacturing its first switchboard  a 50 line Standard Magneto Switchboard  The small manufacturing department expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of the telephone to 50 employees in 1888  By 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees  and a new factory was under construction   As the manufacturing branch expanded  its production ability increased beyond the demand for phones  and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products  This was a problem because the Bell Telephone Company of Canada s  later renamed to Bell Canada  charter would not allow them to build other products  So in 1895  the Bell Telephone of Canada was required to spin off its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies  as well as other devices such as fire alarm boxes  police street call boxes  and fire department call equipment  This company was incorporated as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited   1 2  Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company  Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited was incorporated on 7 December 1895  by the following corporate members  or Board of Directors   Charles Fleetford Sise Sr   President of Bell Canada – Provisional Director  Robert Mackay  merchant – Provisional Director  Hugh Paton  manager of the Shedden Company – Provisional Director  The Hon  Joseph Rosaire Thibaudeau  Senator – Provisional Director  Robert Archer  gentleman – Provisional Director  Charles P  Sclater  secretary – Provisional Director  Lewis B  McFarlane  manager  all of the city and district of Montreal  Quebec   The initial stock capital was $50 000 at $100 per share  with 93 percent held by the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and the remainder held by the seven corporate members above  The first general stockholders meeting was held on March 24  1896   In December 1899  The Bell Telephone Company of Canada bought a cabling company for $500 000  a Canadian charter named it The Wire and Cable Company  Northern Electric and Manufacturing further expanded its product line in 1900  manufacturing the first Canadian wind up gramophones that played flat discs  In 1911 the Wire and Cable company changed its name to the Imperial Wire and Cable Company   1 3  Northern Electric Company  The construction of a new manufacturing plant started in 1913 at Shearer Street in Montreal  Canada  as preparations began for the two manufacturing companies  integration  Then  in January 1914  the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company and the Imperial Wire and Cable Company merged into the Northern Electric Company  commonly known simply as Northern Electric  and the new company opened the doors on a new manufacturing plant in January 1915  This facility at Shearer Street was the primary manufacturing centre until the mid 1950s  Edward Fleetford Sise was the president and his brother Paul Fleetford Sise was the vice president and general manager   During the First World War Northern Electric manufactured the Portable Commutator  a one wire telegraphic switchboard for military operations in the field  In 1922  Northern started to produce  for $5  the  Peanut  vacuum tube  which required only a single dry cell battery  The use of alternating current was still under development during this time  The  Northern Electric Peanut tube was the smallest tube made  and drew only one tenth of an ampere and was the most remarkable radio frequency amplifier ever made   During the 1920s Northern Electric made kettles  toasters  cigar lighters  electric stoves  and washing machines  In January 1923  Northern Electric started to operate an AM radio station with call letters CHYC  in the Shearer Street plant  and much of the programming was religious services for the Northern Electric employees and families in the community  In July 1923  CHYC AM was the first radio station to provide entertainment to the riders of the transcontinental train  in a parlor car fitted with a radio set to receive the broadcast as it left Montreal and traveled west  Later in the 1920s  Northern created the first talking movie sound system in the British Empire for a theater in Montreal   During the Great Depression in the 1930s  Northern Electric was affected  like most other companies  From the beginning of 1930 through the end of 1933  sales dropped from $34 million to $8 2 million  and the number of employees dropped from 6 100 to 2 400   1 4  Independence from Western Electric  In 1949  an antitrust suit in the U S  forced AT&T Western Electric to sell its stake in Northern Electric to Bell Canada  Deprived of its Western Electric tie  Northern began developing its own products  In 1953  Northern Electric produced its first television sets using tubes made by RCA  Bell Canada acquired 100 percent of Northern Electric in 1964  through public stock offerings starting in 1973  Bell s ownership of Northern Electric and its successors would be reduced  though it continued to have majority control   In 1966  the Northern Electric research lab  Northern Electric Laboratories  the predecessor to Bell Northern Research   started looking into the possibilities of fiber optic cable  and in 1969  began work on digitizing telephone communications  Also in 1969  Northern began making inroads into the U S  market with its switching systems  In 1972  it opened its first factory in the U S  in Michigan  In 1975  Northern began shipping its first digital switching systems  one of the earliest such systems to be sold   Northern Telecom was  with Bell Northern Research  in the early 70 s a part owner of MicroSystems International a semiconductor manufacturer based in Kanata  outside Ottawa   1 5  Northern Telecom and  Digital World   In 1976  the company name was changed to Northern Telecom Limited  and management announced its intention to concentrate the company s efforts on digital technology  Northern Telecom was the first company in its industry to announce and to deliver a complete line of fully digital telecommunications products  The product line was branded  Digital World  and included the well known DMS 100  a fully digital central office switch serving as many as 100 000 lines  which was a key contributor to the company’s revenue for close to 15 years   Starting in 1977  Nortel grew rapidly after the introduction of its DMS line of digital central office telephone switches  especially after the AT&T breakup in 1984  Northern Telecom became a significant supplier in Europe and China and was the first non Japanese supplier to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone   1 6  Deregulation  In 1983  due to deregulation  Bell Canada Enterprises  later shortened to BCE  was formed as the parent company to Bell Canada and Northern Telecom  Bell Northern Research was jointly owned 50 50 by Bell Canada and Northern Telecom  The combined three companies were referred to as the tricorporate   As Nortel  the streamlined identity it adopted for its 100th anniversary in 1995  the company set out to dominate the burgeoning global market for public and private networks   1 7  Optical boom and the Right Angle Turn  In 1998  with the acquisition of Bay Networks  the company s name was changed to Nortel Networks to emphasize its ability to provide complete solutions for multiprotocol  multiservice  global networking over the Internet and other communications networks  As a consequence of the stock transaction used to purchase Bay Networks  BCE ceased to be the majority shareholder of Nortel   In 2000  BCE spun out Nortel  distributing its holdings of Nortel to its shareholders  Bell Northern Research was gradually absorbed into Nortel  as it first acquired a majority share in BNR  and eventually acquired the entire company   In the late 1990s  stock market speculators  hoping that Nortel would reap increasingly lucrative profits from the sale of fibre optic network gear  began pushing up the company s share price to unheard of levels despite the company s repeated failure to turn a profit  Under the leadership of CEO John Roth  sales of optical equipment had been robust in the late 1990s  but the market was soon saturated  When the speculative telecom bubble of the late 1990s reached its pinnacle late in the year 2000  Nortel was to become one of the most spectacular casualties   At its height  Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX   employing 94 500 worldwide  with 25 900 in Canada alone  Nortel s market capitalization fell from C$398 billion in September 2000 to less than C$5 billion in August 2002  as Nortel s stock price plunged from C$124 to C$0 47  When Nortel s stock crashed  it took with it a wide swath of Canadian investors and pension funds and left 60 000 Nortel employees unemployed  Roth was criticized after it was revealed that he cashed in his own stock options for a personal gain of C$135 million in 2000 alone   CEO John Roth retired in 2001  His planned successor and chief operating officer  Clarence Chandran  already on sick leave due to complications following his 1997 stabbing in Singapore  decided to quit  however  Chief financial officer Frank Dunn was eventually chosen as Roth s permanent replacement   1 8  After the Internet bubble  1 8 1  Accounting restatements  Frank Dunn presided over a dramatic restructuring of Nortel  which included laying off two thirds of its workforce  60 000 staff  and writedowns of nearly US$16 billion in 2001 alone  This had some initial perceived success in turning the company around  with an unexpected return to profitability reported in the first quarter of 2003  The black ink triggered a total of $70 million in bonuses to the top 43 managers  with $7 8 million going to Dunn alone  $3 million to chief financial officer Douglas Beatty  and $2 million to controller Michael Gollogly  Independent auditor Deloitte & Touche advised audit committee chairman John Cleghorn and board chairman  Red  Wilson to look into the suspicious results  who promptly hired the law firm WilmerHale to vet the financial statements  In late October 2003  Nortel announced that it intended to restate approximately $900 million of liabilities carried on its previously reported balance sheet as of June 30  2003  following a comprehensive internal review of these liabilities  The Company stated that the restatement s principal effects would be a reduction in previously reported net losses for 2000  2001  and 2002 and an increase in shareholders’ equity and net assets previously reported on its balance sheet  A dozen of the company s most senior executives returned $8 6 million of bonuses they were paid based on the erroneous accounting  Investigators ultimately found about $3 billion in revenue had been booked improperly in 1998  1999  and 2000  More than $2 billion was moved into later years  about $750 million was pushed forward beyond 2003 and about $250 million was wiped away completely  The accounting scandal hurt both Nortel s reputation and finances  as Nortel spent an estimated US$400 million on outside auditors and management consultants to retrain staff   Dunn  Beatty  and Gollogly were fired on April 28  2004 for financial mismanagement  and later charged with fraud by the RCMP  The trial began on January 16  2012  ending with acquittals for all three   The SEC also filed charges against them and four vice presidents for civil fraud   To improve Nortel s liquidity in support of its operations  Nortel reached an agreement in 2003 with Export Development Canada for it to provide Nortel with a credit support facility of up to US$750 million  Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation denounced the line of credit  calling it  corporate welfare at its worst    1 8 2  Owens and Zafirovski  After Dunn s firing  retired United States Admiral Bill Owens – at the time a member of the board of directors – was appointed interim CEO  Nortel Networks subsequently returned to using the Nortel name for branding purposes only  the official company name was not changed   Nortel acquired PEC Solutions  a provider of information technology and telecommunications services to various government agencies and departments  in June 2005 and renamed it Nortel Government Solutions Incorporated  NGS   LG Electronics and Nortel formed a joint venture in August  with Nortel owning 50% plus one share  to offer telecom and networking solutions in the wireline  optical  wireless and enterprise areas for South Korean and global customers   Peter W  Currie  previously the Chief Financial Officer  CFO  of the Royal Bank of Canada  was named CFO of Nortel in 2005  having previously served as Northern Telecom s CFO in the 1990s  Gary Daichendt  the former Chief Operating Officer of Cisco Systems  was hired as President and COO  and was expected to succeed Owens as CEO  Shortly afterward  Daichendt appointed ex Cisco Chief Science Officer Gary Kunis as Chief Technology Officer  CTO   Both Garys were concerned about the overall direction of Nortel  especially when compared to Cisco  their previous employer  Just three months later  Daichendt resigned after both his restructuring plan and his suggestion that Owens and Currie leave the company immediately were rejected by the board of directors  Kunis quit shortly thereafter  At the year s end  directors Lynton  Red  Wilson and John Cleghorn retired from the board   Mike S  Zafirovski  who had served as President and CEO of GE Lighting and then as Motorola President and COO  succeeded Owens as president and CEO on November 15  2005  Motorola filed a suit against Zafirovski s hiring  alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non disclosure agreement he had signed  Nortel agreed to pay $11 5 million on his behalf to settle the lawsuit  Nortel also paid out US$575 million and 629 million common shares in 2006 to settle a class action lawsuit that accused the company of misleading investors about the company s health   Currie stepped down as Executive Vice President and CFO in early 2007  In February 2007  Nortel announced its plans to reduce its workforce by 2 000 employees  and to transfer an additional 1 000 jobs to lower cost job sites  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Nortel for accounting fraud from 2000 to 2003  the fraud was allegedly to close gaps between its true performance  its internal targets and Wall Street expectations  Nortel settled the case  paying $35 million  which the Commission distributed to affected shareholders  and reported periodically to the Commission on remedial measures to improve its financial accounting   Nortel announced plans in February 2008 to eliminate 2 100 jobs  and to transfer another 1 000 jobs to lower cost centres  As part of the reductions  Nortel shut down its Calgary campus in 2009   During its reporting of third quarter 2008 results  Nortel announced it would restructure into three vertically integrated business units  Enterprise  Carrier Networks  and Metro Ethernet Networks  As part of the decentralization of its organization  four executive positions were eliminated  effective January 1  2009  Chief Marketing Officer   Lauren Flaherty  Chief Technology Officer   John Roese  Global Services President   Dietmar Wendt  and Executive Vice President Global Sales   Bill Nelson  A net reduction of 1 300 jobs was also announced  As its stock price dropped below $1  the New York Stock Exchange notified Nortel that it would be delisted if its common shares failed to rise above $1 per share within 6 months  Rumours continued to persist of Nortel s poor financial health  amid the late 2000s recession  and its bids for government funds were turned down   1 9  Liquidation  1 9 1  Protection from creditors  On January 14  2009  Nortel filed for protection from creditors  in the United States under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code  in Canada under the Companies  Creditors Arrangement Act  and in the United Kingdom under the Insolvency Act 1986  Nortel was the first major technology company to seek bankruptcy protection in this global downturn  Nortel had an interest payment of $107 million due the next day  approximately 4 6% of its cash reserves of approximately $2 3 billion  After the announcement  the share price fell more than 79% on the Toronto Stock Exchange  Export Development Canada agreed to provide up to C$30 million in short term financing through its existing credit support facility with Nortel  The Canadian government resisted characterizing its position on Nortel as a bailout   Nortel initially hoped to re emerge from bankruptcy  implementing a retention bonus plan in an effort to retain its top executives during the restructuring period  These bonuses  totaling US$45 million  were targeted at 1 000 executive positions  At the end of January 2009  Nortel announced that it would be discontinuing its WiMAX business and its agreement with Alvarion  Nortel subsequently sold its Layer 4–7 application delivery business to Israeli technology firm Radware for $18 million  after Radware had initially placed a stalking horse bid  Nortel had acquired the application switch product line in October 2000 when it purchased Alteon WebSystems   1 9 2  Wind up  With the worsening recession and stock market decline deterring potential companies from bidding for Nortel s assets  and many of Nortel s major customers reconsidering their relationships with the restructuring company  in June Nortel announced that it no longer planned to emerge from bankruptcy protection  and would seek buyers for all of its business units  After announcing it planned to sell off all of its assets  Nortel shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 26  2009 at a price of $0 185 per share  down from its high in 2000 when it comprised a third of the S&P TSX composite index  Mike Zafirovski subsequently resigned in August  and Nortel s board of directors was reorganized with three members instead of nine  Nortel handed out $14 2 million in cash compensation to seven executives in 2009  Nortel also paid out $1 4 million to 10 former and current directors  and paid $140 million to lawyers  pension  human resources and financial experts helping to oversee the company’s bankruptcy proceedings   Nokia Siemens Networks made a stalking horse bid to purchase Nortel s CDMA and LTE assets for $650 million  By the July 21 deadline for additional bids  MatlinPatterson and Ericsson had made offers  and Ericsson emerged as the victor in the following auction  with a purchase price of $1 13 billion  Avaya won an auction for Nortel s Enterprise Solutions business  including Nortel s stake in Nortel Government Solutions and DiamondWare  for $900 million  after having placed a stalking horse bid of $475 million  In November  Nortel sold its MEN  Metro Ethernet Networks  unit to Ciena Corporation for US$530 million in cash and US$239 million in convertible notes  and its GSM business at auction to Ericsson and Kapsch for US$103 million  Hitachi purchased the Next Generation Packet Core assets  As insurance against judgments in class action lawsuits filed by former employees  John Roth filed in December 2009 for a US$1 billion indemnification from Nortel  joining the list of U S  creditors   In February 2010  Ernst & Young  the court appointed monitor of Nortel s Canadian bankruptcy proceedings  reported that the assets of Nortel s Health and Welfare Trust had a shortfall of $37 million in its net assets as of December 31  2008  The trust supports pensioners  medical  dental and life insurance benefits  as well as income support for some groups such as long term disability recipients  Also in February  Nortel negotiated a $57 million deal to wind up the health care and other benefits provided to former Canadian employees  Shortly afterwards  Nortel proposed spending $92 3M on retention bonuses for 1 475 employees in its Nortel Business Services and Corporate groups  with $2 5 million in incentives going to Christopher Ricaute  president of Nortel Business Services  $27 million allocated for Canadian employees  and $55 million allocated for U S  employees  The proposed plan was later extended by an additional $27 million  Claiming that the retention bonuses proposal was extraordinary  acting US trustee Roberta DeAngelis objected to the payment of $55 6 million to 866 employees  However  court appointed representatives for Nortel s former employees  who are creditors in the Ontario bankruptcy court  have signed an agreement to not oppose any employee incentive program   Genband purchased the Carrier VoIP and Application Solutions  CVAS  unit in May 2010  as Nortel accepted its stalking horse bid of $282 million  with adjustments that decreased the net sale price to about $100 million  without a formal bidding process  Ericsson purchased Nortel s share in its joint venture with LG Electronics for US$242 million  forming LG Ericsson  in June 2010  Ericsson also purchased Nortel s final operating unit  the Multi Service Switch division  in September 2010 for US$65 million  Nortel s Ottawa campus on Carling Avenue was purchased by Public Works and Government Services Canada  PWGSC  in October 2010 for a cash purchase price of CDN$208 million   Nortel s 53 13% stake in Turkish

applications encompassing technologies such as wireless  wireless 4G  data networking  optical  voice  Internet  and semiconductors  was sold for $4 5 billion to a consortium including Apple  EMC  Ericsson  Microsoft  Research In Motion  and Sony  pending American and Canadian court approval   Google had placed the initial stalking horse bid of $900 million and later upped the bid to $1 902 160 540  then $2 614 972 128  and eventually $3 14159 billion  which are references to Brun s constant  Meissel–Mertens constant  and pi   Bankruptcy filings state that Nortel owes former Canadian engineers $285 000 for patent awards that were not paid   In October 2011  the administrators of Nortel s British subsidiary lost their appeal to overturn a court order requiring them to pay £2 1 billion into Nortel s underfunded pension plan   Nortel Networks U S  retirement income plan is now managed by PBGC Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  January 2014  a pact between U S  and European

communications carriers  landline telephone  mobile phone  and cable TV carriers   Technologies included telephonic  voice  equipment  fiber optics  local wireless  and multimedia   Past products included   3  Criticism and controversy  3 1  Hackers had free access for years without being detected  In September 1991  Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was discovered in the act of hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel   In 2004  it was discovered that crackers  malicious hackers  gained almost complete access to Nortel s systems  Thought to have originated in 2000  for nearly ten years they accessed documents including emails  technical papers  research  development reports  and business plans  The breach was not properly addressed by the time the company started selling some of its assets in 2009  following a bankruptcy filing  The Wall Street Journal reports that hackers working from Chinese IP addresses used seven passwords of Nortel executives  including a former CEO  to penetrate networks owned by the company   Brian Shields  a former systems security advisor for Nortel  led an internal investigation on the breach and exposed rootkit software on at least two machines in 2009 that allowed hackers to control them remotely and monitor email  Despite the original discovery in 2004 and the subsequent investigation that led to the rootkit detection in 2009  Nortel allegedly ignored the problem and failed to disclose it to potential buyers of its business  Avaya and Genband both acquired parts of Nortel  and some employees used old Nortel machines connected to the new companies  networks  Although Avaya says it has dealt with the issue  Shields says  it s despicable that Nortel didn t say anything   leaving it up to him to inform the new company of his investigation  Nortel refused to comment on The Wall Street Journal report  but former CEO Mike Zafirovski  in charge between 2005 and 2009  claimed the company  did not believe it was a real issue    Mr  Shields went on to tell the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he believes the extensive cyberattacks on Nortel contributed to its downfall   3 2  Government bailouts  3 2 1  2003  On Feb 16  2003 the Winnipeg Sun published an article criticising the Canadian Federal government for propping up “mega loser Nortel” through Export Development Canada  EDC   The article interviewed Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who termed this EDC support as  corporate welfare at its worst   Mr Robinson was appalled that Canadians who already lost billions on Nortel on the stock market would be asked for even more money through their taxes to support Nortel   3 2 2  2009  EDC had agreed to provide up to $30 million in short term financing through an existing bonding facility  The Canadian government resisted characterizing its position on Nortel as a bailout   3 3  Illegal breach of trust in Nortel s Health and Welfare Trust  There have been reports of financial irregularities at Nortel s Health and Welfare Trust  Diane Urquhart  a financial analyst  testified before a parliamentary committee that $100 million is missing from the HWT and that a $37 million loan to the corporation has not been paid back  The HWT was an unregistered trust maintained by Nortel to provide medical  dental  life insurance  long term disability and survivor income and pension transition benefits  Until 2005 Nortel fully funded the disability insurance in its HWT  However  it is alleged that since then  the HWT Governance Committees and third party trustee  Northern Trust  breached their fiduciary duties to protect Nortel s disabled employees and survivors of deceased employees by allowing Nortel to misdirect over $100 million from the HWT for purposes inconsistent with the terms of the HWT  As of March 1  2012  Northern Trust continues to act as the paying agent for Canadian Nortel pensioners   3 4  Bookkeeping irregularities  In 2007 both the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission laid charges against former senior financial officials from Nortel including Frank Dunn who was fired from Nortel in 2004  Frank Dunn was promoted from chief financial officer to replace John A  Roth as CEO in November  2001  According to the SEC  Dunn and three other financial officers began to fudge revenue by misusing  bill and hold  transactions starting  no later than September  2000   The SEC said that at least a year s worth of the alleged book keeping took place while John Roth was still CEO of Nortel  even though no charges were laid against him   3 5  Executive compensation  3 5 1  2001 compensation  In the article “Nortel s Roth Rakes It In” published by Light Reading  Nortel was criticized for raising its CEO’s pay just days before he announced his intention to retire in May 2001  The article went on to state that Nortel’s share prices tumbled almost twentyfold during Roth’s years at the helm of Nortel and its number of employees dropped dramatically   3 5 2  2003 compensation  In 2003 Nortel paid tens of millions of dollars in so called  return to profitability  bonuses  largely to a select group of senior managers  The  return to profitability  has been alleged to be a fabrication achieved by the release of $490 million in reserves to boost earnings   3 5 3  2008 compensation  In 2008  despite continuing losses  layoffs  and declining share prices at the struggling telecom gear maker  Nortel Networks CEO Mike Zafirovski was awarded a 21 5 percent pay increase to $10 1 million   3 5 4  2009 compensation  As Nortel entered bankruptcy proceedings  it paid out retention bonuses to almost 1 000 top executives  totalling up to US$45 million  drawing criticism as the company withheld severance payments to employees laid off prior to the creditor protection filing  Nortel proceeded with thousands of additional layoffs without severance  and the pension fund remained underfunded  while Nortel paid $14 2 million in cash to seven executives  Nortel also paid $1 4 million to ten former and current directors  and paid $140 million to lawyers  pension  human resources and financial experts helping to oversee the company’s bankruptcy proceedings   3 5 5  2010 compensation  In a U S  court filing on February 11  2010  Nortel proposed to spend $92 3M on retention bonuses for 1 475 employees in its Nortel Business Services and Corporate groups  According to the plan  Christopher Ricaurte  president of Nortel Business Services  would receive $2 5 million in incentives  In all  Canadian employees were eligible for $27 million  U S  employees $55 million  and about $10 million would go to others  This proposed plan came the same week Nortel negotiated a $57 million deal to wind up health care and other benefits for former Canadian employees  Claiming that the retention bonuses proposal was extraordinary  acting US trustee Roberta DeAngelis objected to the payment of $55 6 million to 866 employees  However  court appointed representatives for Nortel former employees  who are creditors in the Ontario bankruptcy court  have signed an agreement to not oppose any employee incentive program   3 6  Treatment of Nortel pensioners  On June 23  2010 the News and Observer published a story criticizing treatment pensioners have been receiving from their former employer  Nortel  According to the article  Nortel has asked a federal court to terminate medical coverage  prescription drug coverage  long term disability  and life insurance of 4 000 retirees and dependents  claiming the benefits are costing the company $2 million per month  Nortel blamed the company s creditors for this decision   3 7  Nortel ex CEO files as a creditor seeking $1 billion from the proceeds of bankruptcy  In the middle of the decade several class action lawsuits were filed against John Roth and others  by former employees who felt that their 401K company plans were depleted due to misrepresentation by the defendants  They claimed they were duped into investing in Nortel stock  when those who encouraged them to do so allegedly knew that the company was ailing  John Roth left Nortel in 2001 with more than $130 million   In 2009 Mr  Roth filed a claim for $1 billion  aiming to become a creditor to the assets of Nortel along with all other Nortel employees  in case the class action lawsuits against him succeeded   3 8  Conflicts of interest  During Nortel s 2002 annual shareholders  meeting held in Halifax  Nova Scotia  several shareholders  including Robert Verdun  complained about non arms length relationships with service providers such as director Yves Fortier  who provided legal services to Nortel while sitting on its board  and Nortel s auditors  Deloitte & Touche LLP  who were paid $15 million for non auditing services   4  Corporate information  4 1  Headquarters  Nortel s current headquarters is located at 5945 Airport
