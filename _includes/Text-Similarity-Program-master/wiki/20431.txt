In classical mechanics  linear momentum or translational momentum  pl  momenta  SI unit kg m s  or equivalently  N s  is the product of the mass and velocity of an object  For example  a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentum—it takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed  and it takes a large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop afterwards  If the truck were lighter  or moving more slowly  then it would have less momentum   Like velocity  linear momentum is a vector quantity  possessing a direction as well as a magnitude   Linear momentum is also a conserved quantity  meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces  its total linear momentum cannot change  In classical mechanics  conservation of linear momentum is implied by Newton s laws  but it also holds in special relativity  with a modified formula  and  with appropriate definitions  a  generalized  linear momentum conservation law holds in electrodynamics  quantum mechanics  quantum field theory  and general relativity   1  Newtonian mechanics  Momentum has a direction as well as magnitude  Quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction are known as vector quantities  Because momentum has a direction  it can be used to predict the resulting direction of objects after they collide  as well as their speeds  Below  the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension  The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations  see multiple dimensions    1 1  Single particle  The momentum of a particle is traditionally represented by the letter   It is the product of two quantities  the mass  represented by the letter   and velocity      The units of momentum are the product of the units of mass and velocity  In SI units  if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity in meters per second  then the momentum is in kilogram meters second  kg m s   Being a vector  momentum has magnitude and direction  For example  a model airplane of 1 kg  traveling due north at 1 m s in straight and level flight  has a momentum of 1 kg m s due north measured from the ground   1 2  Many particles  The momentum of a system of particles is the sum of their momenta  If two particles have masses and   and velocities and   the total momentum is  The momenta of more than two particles can be added in the same way   A system of particles has a center of mass  a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions   If all the particles are moving  the center of mass will generally be moving as well  unless the system is in pure rotation around it   If the center of mass is moving at velocity   the momentum is   This is known as Euler s first law   1 3  Relation to force  If a force is applied to a particle for a time interval   the momentum of the particle changes by an amount  In differential form  this gives Newton s second law  the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the force acting on it   If the force depends on time  the change in momentum  or impulse  between times and is  The second law only applies to a particle that does not exchange matter with its surroundings  and so it is equivalent to write  so the force is equal to mass times acceleration   Example  a model airplane of 1 kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6 m s due north in 2 s  The thrust required to produce this acceleration is 3 newton  The change in momentum is 6 kg m s  The rate of change of momentum is 3  kg舁m s  s   3 N   1 4  Conservation  In a closed system  one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces  the total momentum is constant  This fact  known as the law of conservation of momentum  is implied by Newton s laws of motion  Suppose  for example  that two particles interact  Because of the third law  the forces between them are equal and opposite  If the particles are numbered 1 and 2  the second law states that and   Therefore  or  If the velocities of the particles are and before the interaction  and afterwards they are and   then  This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles  Similarly  if there are several particles  the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero  so the total change in momentum is zero  This conservation law applies to all interactions  including collisions and separations caused by explosive forces  It can also be generalized to situations where Newton s laws do not hold  for example in the theory of relativity and in electrodynamics   1 5  Dependence on reference frame  Momentum is a measurable quantity  and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer  For example  if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending  an outside observer looking into the elevator sees the apple moving  so to that observer the apple has a nonzero momentum  To someone inside the elevator  the apple does not move  so it has zero momentum  The two observers each have a frame of reference in which they observe motions  and if the elevator is descending steadily they will see behavior that is consistent with the same physical laws   Suppose a particle has position in a stationary frame of reference  From the point of view of another frame of reference moving at a uniform speed   the position  represented by a primed coordinate  changes with time as  This is called a Galilean transformation  If the particle is moving at speed in the first frame of reference  in the second it is moving at speed  Since does not change  the accelerations are the same   Thus  momentum is conserved in both reference frames  Moreover  as long as the force has the same form in both frames  Newton s second law is unchanged  Forces such as Newtonian gravity  which depend only on the scalar distance between objects  satisfy this criterion  This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or Galilean invariance   A change of reference frame can often simplify calculations of motion  For example  in a collision of two particles a reference frame can be chosen where one particle begins at rest  Another commonly used reference frame is the center of mass frame  one that is moving with the center of mass  In this frame  the total momentum is zero   1 6  Application to collisions  By itself  the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision  Another property of the motion  kinetic energy  must be known  This is not necessarily conserved  If it is conserved  the collision is called an elastic collision  if not  it is an inelastic collision   1 6 1  Elastic collisions  An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is lost  Perfectly elastic  collisions  can occur when the objects do not touch each other  as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart  A slingshot maneuver of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision from a distance  A collision between two pool balls is a good example of an almost totally elastic collision  due to their high rigidity  but when bodies come in contact there is always some dissipation   A head on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension  along a line passing through the bodies  If the velocities are and before the collision and and after  the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are   A change of reference frame can often simplify the analysis of a collision  For example  suppose there are two bodies of equal mass   one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed  as in the figure   The center of mass is moving at speed and both bodies are moving towards it at speed   Because of the symmetry  after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed  Adding the speed of the center of mass to both  we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed   The bodies have exchanged their velocities  Regardless of the velocities of the bodies  a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion  Therefore  the final velocities are given by  In general  when the initial velocities are known  the final velocities are given by  If one body has much greater mass than the other  its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change   1 6 2  Inelastic collisions  In an inelastic collision  some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy such as heat or sound  Examples include traffic collisions  in which the effect of lost kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles  electrons losing some of their energy to atoms  as in the Franck–Hertz experiment   and particle accelerators in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles   In a perfectly inelastic collision  such as a bug hitting a windshield   both bodies have the same motion afterwards  If one body is motionless to begin with  the equation for conservation of momentum is  so  In a frame of reference moving at the speed   the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted   One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the coefficient of restitution   defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach  In applying this measure to ball sports  this can be easily measured using the following formula   The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart  For example  an explosion is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical  mechanical  or nuclear form into kinetic energy  acoustic energy  and electromagnetic radiation  Rockets also make use of conservation of momentum  propellant is thrust outward  gaining momentum  and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket   1 7  Multiple dimensions  Real motion has both direction and magnitude and must be represented by a vector  In a coordinate system with axes  velocity has components in the direction  in the direction  in the direction  The vector is represented by a boldface symbol   Similarly  the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface symbol   The equations in the previous sections work in vector form if the scalars and are replaced by vectors and   Each vector equation represents three scalar equations  For example   represents three equations   The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule  The equations are still one dimensional  but each scalar represents the magnitude of the vector  for example   Each vector equation represents three scalar equations  Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed  as in the figure  Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result   A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere  the two will head off at right angles after the collision  as in the figure    1 8  Objects of variable mass  The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of variable mass objects such as a rocket ejecting fuel or a star accreting gas  In analyzing such an object  one treats the object s mass as a function that varies with time    The momentum of the object at time is therefore   One might then try to invoke Newton s second law of motion by saying that the external force on the object is related to its momentum by   but this is incorrect  as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to    This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable mass objects  The correct equation is  where is the velocity of the ejected accreted mass as seen in the object s rest frame  This is distinct from   which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame   This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected accreted mass  When considered together  the object and the mass constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved   2  Relativistic mechanics  2 1  Lorentz invariance  Newtonian physics assumes that absolute time and space exist outside of any observer  this gives rise to the Galilean invariance described earlier  It also results in a prediction that the speed of light can vary from one reference frame to another  This is contrary to observation  In the special theory of relativity  Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame  but assumes that the speed of light is invariant  As a result  position and time in two reference frames are related by the Lorentz transformation instead of the Galilean transformation   Consider  for example  a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity in the direction  The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the moving frame as  while the Lorentz transformation gives  where is the Lorentz factor   Newton s second law  with mass fixed  is not invariant under a Lorentz transformation  However  it can be made invariant by making the inertial mass of an object a function of velocity   is the object s invariant mass   The modified momentum   obeys Newton s second law   Within the domain of classical mechanics  relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum  at low velocity  is approximately equal to   the Newtonian expression for momentum   2 2  Four vector formulation  In the theory of relativity  physical quantities are expressed in terms of four vectors that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates  These vectors are generally represented by capital letters  for example for position  The expression for the four momentum depends on how the coordinates are expressed  Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four vector have dimensions of length  If the latter scaling is used  an interval of proper time    defined by  is invariant under Lorentz transformations  in this expression and in what follows the metric signature has been used  different authors use different conventions   Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways  by treating the four vectors as Euclidean vectors and multiplying time by the square root of   or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a Minkowski space  In a Minkowski space  the scalar product of two four vectors and is defined as  In all the coordinate systems  the  contravariant  relativistic four velocity is defined by  and the  contravariant  four momentum is  where is the invariant mass  If  in Minkowski space   then  Using Einstein s mass energy equivalence    this can be rewritten as  Thus  conservation of four momentum is Lorentz invariant and implies conservation of both mass and energy   The magnitude of the momentum four vector is equal to    and is invariant across all reference frames   The relativistic energy–momentum relationship holds even for massless particles such as photons  by setting it follows that  In a game of relativistic  billiards   if a stationary particle is hit by a moving particle in an elastic collision  the paths formed by the two afterwards will form an acute angle  This is unlike the non relativistic case where they travel at right angles   3  Quantum mechanics  In quantum mechanics  momentum is defined as an operator on the wave function  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once  In quantum mechanics  position and momentum are conjugate variables   For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can be written as  where ∇ is the gradient operator  ħ is the reduced Planck constant  and i is the imaginary unit  This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator  though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms  For example  in momentum space the momentum operator is represented as  where the operator p acting on a wave function ψ p  yields that wave function multiplied by the value p  in an analogous fashion to the way that the position operator acting on a wave function ψ x  yields that wave function multiplied by the value x   For both massive and massless objects  relativistic momentum is related to the de Broglie wavelength by  Electromagnetic radiation  including visible light  ultraviolet light  and radio waves  is carried by photons  Even though photons  the particle aspect of light  have no mass  they still carry momentum  This leads to applications such as the solar sail  The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric media is somewhat controversial  see Abraham–Minkowski controversy    4  Generalized coordinates  Newton s laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by constraints  For example  a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot  Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of generalized coordinates that may be fewer in number  Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates  They introduce a generalized momentum  also known as the canonical or conjugate momentum  that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum  To distinguish it from generalized momentum  the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as mechanical  kinetic or kinematic momentum  The two main methods are described below   4 1  Lagrangian mechanics  In Lagrangian mechanics  a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy    If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable  then the equations of motion  known as the Lagrange or Euler–Lagrange equations  are a set of equations   If a coordinate is not a Cartesian coordinate  the associated generalized momentum component does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear momentum  Even if is a Cartesian coordinate  will not be the same as the mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity  Some sources represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol    In this mathematical framework  a generalized momentum is associated with the generalized coordinates  Its components are defined as  Each component is said to be the conjugate momentum for the coordinate    Now if a given coordinate does not appear in the Lagrangian  although its time derivative might appear   then  This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum   Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates  the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates  An example is found in the section on electromagnetism   4 2  Hamiltonian mechanics  In Hamiltonian mechanics  the Lagrangian  a function of generalized coordinates and their derivatives  is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of generalized coordinates and momentum  The Hamiltonian is defined as  where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above  The Hamiltonian equations of motion are  As in Lagrangian mechanics  if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian  its conjugate momentum component is conserved   4 3  Symmetry and conservation  Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the homogeneity  shift symmetry  of space  position in space is the canonical conjugate quantity to momentum   That is  conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position  this is a special case of Noether s theorem   5  Electromagnetism  In Newtonian mechanics  the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from the law of action and reaction  which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and opposite force  Under some circumstances one moving charged particle can exert a force on another without any return force  Moreover  Maxwell s equations  the foundation of classical electrodynamics  are Lorentz invariant  Nevertheless  the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved   5 1  Vacuum  In Maxwell s equations  the forces between particles are mediated by electric and magnetic fields  The electromagnetic force  Lorentz force  on a particle with charge due to a combination of electric field and magnetic field  as given by the  B field    is  This force imparts a momentum to the particle  so by Newton s second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields   In a vacuum  the momentum per unit volume is  where is the vacuum permeability and is the speed of light  The momentum density is proportional to the Poynting vector which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area   If momentum is to be conserved in a volume   changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum  If is the momentum of all the particles in a volume   and the particles are treated as a continuum  then Newton s second law gives  The electromagnetic momentum is  and the equation for conservation of each component of the momentum is  The term on the right is an integral over the surface representing momentum flow into and out of the volume  and is a component of the surface normal of   The quantity is called the Maxwell stress tensor  defined as  5 2  Media  The above results are for the microscopic Maxwell equations  applicable to electromagnetic forces in a vacuum  or on a very small scale in media   It is more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary  The definition of electromagnetic momentum density is modified to  where the H field is related to the B field and the magnetization by  The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media   5 3  Particle in field  If a charged particle moves in an electromagnetic field  its kinetic momentum is not conserved  However  it has a canonical momentum that is conserved   5 3 1  Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation  The kinetic momentum is different from the canonical momentum  synonymous with the generalized momentum  conjugate to the ordinary position coordinates   because includes a contribution from the electric potential and vector potential           Classical mechanics   Relativistic mechanics      Lagrangian          Canonical momentum           Kinetic momentum           Hamiltonian         where is the velocity  see time derivative   is the electric charge of the particle and is the Lorentz factor  See also Electromagnetism  momentum   If neither nor depends on position  is conserved   The classical Hamiltonian for a particle in any field equals the total energy of the system – the kinetic energy  where   see dot product  plus the potential energy   For a particle in an electromagnetic field  the potential energy is   and since the kinetic energy always corresponds to the kinetic momentum   replacing the kinetic momentum by the above equation    leads to the Hamiltonian in the table   These Lagrangian and Hamiltonian expressions can derive the Lorentz force   5 3 2  Canonical commutation relations  The kinetic momentum  p above  satisfies the commutation relation   where  j  k  are indices labelling vector components  B is a component of the magnetic field  and εkj is the Levi Civita symbol  here in 3 dimensions   6  Deformable bodies and fluids  6 1  Conservation in a continuum  In fields such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics  it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules  Instead  the materials must be approximated by a continuum in which there is a particle or fluid parcel at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby  In particular  it has a density and velocity that depend on time and position   The momentum per unit volume is    Consider a column of water in hydrostatic equilibrium  All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless  On any given drop of water  two forces are balanced  The first is gravity  which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside  The gravitational force per unit volume is   where is the gravitational acceleration  The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water  The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity  The normal force per unit area is the pressure   The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure  so the force balance equation is  If the forces are not balanced  the droplet accelerates  This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative because the fluid in a given volume changes with time  Instead  the material derivative is needed   Applied to any physical quantity  the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to advection as fluid is carried past the point  Per unit volume  the rate of change in momentum is equal to   This is equal to the net force on the droplet   Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity  as above  In addition  surface forces can deform the droplet  In the simplest case  a shear stress   exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet  is proportional to the rate of deformation or strain rate  Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another  If the speed in the direction varies with   the tangential force in direction per unit area normal to the direction is  where is the viscosity  This is also a flux  or flow per unit area  of x momentum through the surface   Including the effect of viscosity  the momentum balance equations for the incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid are  These are known as the Navier–Stokes equations   The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials  including solids  For each surface with normal in direction and force in direction   there is a stress component   The nine components make up the Cauchy stress tensor   which includes both pressure and shear  The local conservation of momentum is expressed by the Cauchy momentum equation   where is the body force   The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to deformations of solids and liquids  The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends on the properties of the material  see Types of viscosity    6 2  Acoustic waves  A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations  or waves  that propagate away from their source  In a fluid  small changes in pressure can often be described by the acoustic wave equation   where is the speed of sound  In a solid  similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure  P waves  and shear  S waves    The flux  or transport per unit area  of a momentum component by a velocity is equal to   In the linear approximation that leads to the above acoustic equation  the time average of this flux is zero  However  nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average  It is possible for momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean momentum   7  History of the concept  In about 530 A D   working in Alexandria  Byzantine philosopher John Philoponus developed a concept of momentum in his commentary to Aristotle s Physics  Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something  For example  a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle s theory until the time of Galileo  but a few were skeptical  Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle s claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage  He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it  Ibn Sīnā  also known by his Latinized name Avicenna  read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in The Book of Healing in 1020  He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower  but unlike Philoponus  who believed that it was a temporary virtue that would decline even in a vacuum  he viewed it as a persistent  requiring external forces such as air resistance to dissipate it  The work of Philoponus  and possibly that of Ibn Sīnā  was read and refined by the European philosophers Peter Olivi and Jean Buridan  Buridan  who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris  referred to impetus being proportional to the weight times the speed  Moreover  Buridan s theory was different from his predecessor s in that he did not consider impetus to be self dissipating  asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus   René Descartes believed that the total  quantity of motion  in the universe is conserved  where the quantity of motion is understood as the product of size and speed  This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum  since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size  and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved  So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface  changing its direction but not its speed  there would be no change in its quantity of motion  Galileo  later  in his Two New Sciences  used the Italian word impeto   Leibniz  in his  Discourse on Metaphysics   gave an argument against Descartes  construction of the conservation of the  quantity of motion  using an example of dropping blocks of different sizes different distances  He points out that force is conserved but quantity of motion  construed as the product of size and speed of an object  is not conserved   The first correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum was by English mathematician John Wallis in his 1670 work  Mechanica sive De Motu  Tractatus Geometricus   the initial state of the body  either of rest or of motion  will persist  and  If the force is greater than the resistance  motion will result   Wallis uses momentum and vis for force  Newton s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica  when it was first published in 1687  showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum  His Definition II defines quantitas motus   quantity of motion   as  arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly   which identifies it as momentum  Thus when in Law II he refers to mutatio motus   change of motion   being proportional to the force impressed  he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion  It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion  The first use of  momentum  in its proper mathematical sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning s Miscellanea in 1721  four years before the final edition of Newton s Principia Mathematica  momentum M or  quantity of motion  was being defined for students as  a rectangle   the product of Q and V  where Q is  quantity of material  and V is  velocity   s t   8  See
