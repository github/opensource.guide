Columbia  Canada   Approximately 2 314 554 people live in the Portland metropolitan area  MSA   the 19th most populous MSA in the United States   Portland was incorporated in 1851 and is the county seat of Multnomah County  The city has a commission based government headed by a mayor and four other commissioners as well as Metro  a distinctive regional government  The city is noted for its superior land use planning and investment in light rail  Portland has been recognized as one of the most environmentally conscious cities in the world  because of its public transportation networks and efficient land use planning   Located in the Marine west coast climate region  Portland has a climate marked by both warm  dry summers and wet  cool to chilly winter days  This climate is ideal for growing roses  For more than a century  Portland has been known as the  City of Roses   with many rose gardens – most prominently the International Rose Test Garden  The city is also known for its abundant outdoor activities  liberal political values  and beer and coffee enthusiasm  Portland is home to a large number of independent microbreweries  microdistilleries and food carts that contribute to the unofficial slogan  Keep Portland Weird    1  History  The land that is occupied today by Multnomah County was inhabited for centuries by two bands of Upper Chinook Indians  The Multnomah people settled on and around Sauvie Island  and the Cascades Indians settled along the Columbia Gorge  These groups fished and traded along the river and gathered berries  wapato  and other root vegetables  The nearby Tualatin Plains provided prime hunting grounds  The later settlement of Portland started as a spot known as either  Stumptown  or  the clearing   which was on the banks of the Willamette  located about halfway between Oregon City and Fort Vancouver  In 1843  William Overton saw great commercial potential for this land but lacked the funds required to file a land claim  He struck a bargain with his partner  Asa Lovejoy of Boston  Massachusetts  for 25¢  Overton would share his claim to the site  Overton later sold his half of the claim to Francis W  Pettygrove of Portland  Maine  Pettygrove and Lovejoy each wished to name the new city after his respective home town  In 1845  this controversy was settled with a coin toss  which Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses  The coin used for this decision  now known as the Portland Penny  is on display in the headquarters of the Oregon Historical Society   At the time of its incorporation on February 8  1851  Portland had over 800 inhabitants  a steam sawmill  a log cabin hotel  and a newspaper  the Weekly Oregonian  By 1879  the population had grown to 17 500  The city merged with Albina and East Portland in 1891  and annexed the cities of Linnton and St  Johns in 1915   Portland s location  with access both to the Pacific Ocean via the Willamette and the Columbia rivers and to the agricultural Tualatin Valley via the  Great Plank Road  through a canyon in the West Hills  the route of current day U S  Route 26   gave it an advantage over nearby ports  and it grew very quickly  It remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century  until the 1890s  when Seattle s deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail  affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River   The most common nickname for Portland is The City of Roses  the city s official nickname since 2003  Other nicknames include the City of Bridges  Stumptown  Bridgetown  Rip City  Little Beirut  Beervana or Beertown  P Town  Soccer City USA  Portlandia  and the synecdoche PDX   2  Geography  2 1  Topography  Portland is located 70 miles east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of Oregon s most populated region  the Willamette Valley  Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the Willamette River which flows north through the city center  separating the east and west sections of the city before veering northwest to join with the Columbia River less than 10 miles from downtown  The Columbia River serves as the natural boundary between the states of Washington and Oregon and consequently divides the city of Portland from its most populated suburb Vancouver  Washington  Portland is situated near the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains  also called the West Hills and the Southwest Hills  which pierce through the Northwest and Southwest regions of the city  Council Crest Park  the tallest point within city limits  is located in the West Hills and rises to an elevation of 1 073 feet  To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the Oregon Coast Range  and to the east lies the actively volcanic Cascade Range  On clear days Mt  Hood and Mt St  Helens dominate the horizon while Mt  Adams and Mt  Rainier also are sometimes visible in the distance   According to the United States Census Bureau  the city has a total area of   of which  is land and is water  Although almost all of Portland lies within Multnomah County  small portions of the city lie within Clackamas and Washington counties with mid 2005 populations estimated at 785 and 1 455  respectively   Portland lies on top of an extinct Plio Pleistocene volcanic field known as the Boring Lava Field  The Boring Lava Field includes at least 32 cinder cones such as Mount Tabor  and its center lies in Southeast Portland  The dormant but potentially active volcano Mount Hood to the east of Portland is easily visible from much of the city during clear weather  The active volcano Mount Saint Helens to the north in Washington is visible in the distance from high elevation locations in the city and is close enough to have dusted the city with volcanic ash after an eruption on May 18  1980  Mount Adams  another prominent volcano in Washington state to the northeast of Portland  is also visible from parts of the city   2 2  Cityscape  Portland straddles the Willamette River near its confluence with the Columbia River  The denser and earlier developed west side is mostly hemmed in by the nearby West Hills  Tualatin Mountains   though it extends over them to the border with Washington County  The flatter east side fans out for about 180 blocks  until it meets the suburb of Gresham  Rural Multnomah County lies farther east  In 1891 the cities of Portland  Albina  and East Portland were consolidated  and duplicate street names were given new names  The  great renumbering  on September 2  1931  standardized street naming patterns  and changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block  It divided Portland into five sections  Southwest  Southeast  Northwest  North  and Northeast  Burnside St  divides north and south  and the Willamette River divides east and west  The river curves west five blocks north of Burnside and in place of it  Williams Ave  is used as a divider  The North section lies between Williams Ave  and the Willamette River to the west   On the west side  the RiverPlace  John s Landing and South Waterfront Districts lie in a  sixth quadrant  where addresses go higher from west to east toward the river  This  sixth quadrant  is roughly bounded by Naito Parkway and Barbur Boulevard to the west  Montgomery Street to the north and Nevada Street to the south  East West addresses in this area are denoted with a leading zero  instead of a minus sign   This means 0246 SW California St  is not the same as 246 SW California St  Many mapping programs are unable to distinguish between the two   2 3  Climate  As with much of the Pacific Northwest west of the Cascades  Portland experiences a temperate oceanic climate typified by warm  dry summers and mild  damp winters  the city proper straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 8b and 9a  According to the Köppen climate classification  Portland falls within the cool  dry summer mild temperate zone  Csb   also referred to as warm summer Mediterranean  because of its relatively dry summers  Other climate classification systems  such as Trewartha  place it firmly in the Oceanic zone  Do   Unless otherwise noted  all figures below are quoted from the international airport station   Summers in Portland are warm to hot  dry and relatively sunny with moderately low humidity  The four months of June  July  August and September account for only of total rain combineda small fraction of the of precipitation that falls throughout the year  The warmest month is August with a daily average temperature of   normal temperatures peak in late July and early August  Because of its inland location from the coast  as well as the protective nature of the Oregon Coast Range to its west  Portland summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean  Therefore Portland can experience heat waves  particularly in July and August  with air temperatures rising over for days at a time  Temperatures reach or exceed on 14 days per year and reach or exceed on 1 4 days per year on average  Portland has reached triple digit temperatures in all five months from May through September  The highest temperature ever recorded was   on July 30  1965  as well as August 8 and 10  1981  The record warm daily minimum is on July 28  2009  the last of three occasions   Spring and fall can bring rather unpredictable weather including warm spells that send temperatures surging above   cold snaps plunge the daytime temperatures into the 40s °F  4–9 °C   thunderstorms rolling off the Cascade Range and  although rare  occasional tornadoes  However  mild temperatures in the 50s and 60s °F  10−21 °C  and overcast skies are the normwith rainy or partly overcast days becoming frequent in mid fall and continuing into mid spring  Portland receives less annual rainfall than most cities on the East Coast  however rain often falls as a light drizzle for several consecutive days at a time  contributing to the high number  155  of days with measurable  ≥  precipitation annually   Winters in Portland are long and chilly  overcast and wet with normal temperatures bottoming out in the second half of December and early January  the coolest month is December  with a daily average of   While Portland is at the same latitude as Montreal  Quebec  it averages warmer in meteorological winter because of the direction of the Jet Stream and the fact that Western Canada s mountains shield it from the full force of Arctic blasts  Approximately 55% of Portland s annual precipitation falls between November and February  Nighttime temperatures drop below freezing 33 nights per year on average  and occasionally to or below however  there are only 2 1 days where the high fails to rise above freezing per year  The lowest temperature ever recorded was   on February 2  1950  The record cold daily maximum is on December 30  1968  The average window for freezing temperatures is November 15 thru March 19  allowing a growing season of 240 days   Snowfall is variable  with a normal seasonal accumulation of   many winters get none or only a trace and others get a considerable amount  Snowfall in downtown Portland and at the airport is uncommon and does not happen every winterdue in part to low elevation as well as the urban heat island effect  Neighborhoods outside the downtown core  especially in slightly higher elevations near the West Hills and Mount Tabor  will frequently experience a dusting of snow while downtown receives no snow at all  The city has experienced a few major snow and ice storms in its past with snowfall totals historically reaching at the airport in 1949–50 and at downtown in 1892–93  the last snowless winters at each location were 2002–03 and 2004–05  respectively   3  Demographics  As of the 2010 census  there are 583 776 people residing in the city  organized into 235 508 households  The population density is 4 375 2 people per square mile  There are 265 439 housing units at an average density of 1989 4 per square mile  1 236 3 km²   Population growth in Portland increased 10 3% between 2000 and 2010  Population growth in the Portland metropolitan area has outpaced the national average during the last decade  and this is expected to continue over the next 50 years   The census reported the city as 76 1% White  444 254 people   7 1% Asian  41 448   6 3% Black or African American  36 778   1 0% Native American  5 838   0 5% Pacific Islander  2 919   4 7% belonging to two or more racial groups  24 437  and 5 0%

under the age of 18 and 10 4% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line  Figures delineating the income levels based on race are not available at this time   Although the population of the city is increasing  a 2005 study found that Portland was educating fewer children in that year than it was in 1925  despite the city s population having almost doubled since then  The study concluded that the city would have to close the equivalent of three to four elementary schools each year for the next decade  But in 2013  The Oregonian reported five consecutive years of increased enrollment in Portland Public Schools   In 1940  Portland s African American population was approximately 2 000 and largely consisted of railroad employees and their families  During the war time liberty ship construction boom  the need for workers drew many blacks to the city  The new influx of blacks settled in specific neighborhoods  such as the Albina district and Vanport  The May 1948 flood which destroyed Vanport eliminated the only integrated neighborhood  and an influx of blacks into the northeast quadrant of the city continued  Portland s longshoremen racial mix was described as being  lily white  in the 1960s  when the local International Longshore and Warehouse Union declined to represent grain handlers since some were black   At 6 3%  Portland s African American population is three times the state average  Over two thirds of Oregon s African American residents live in Portland  As of the 2000 census  three of its high schools  Cleveland  Lincoln and Wilson  were over 70% white  reflecting the overall population  while Jefferson High School was 87% non white  The remaining six schools have a higher number of non whites  including blacks and Asians  Hispanic students average from 3 3% at Wilson to 31% at Roosevelt   Portland residents identifying solely as Asian Americans account for 7 1% of the population  an additional 1 8% is partially of Asian heritage  Vietnamese Americans make up 2 2% of Portland s population  and make up the largest Asian ethnic group in the city  followed by Chinese  1 7%   Filipinos  0 6%   Japanese  0 5%

seventh highest LGBT population in the country  with 8 8% of residents identifying as homosexual  and the metro area ranks fourth in the nation at 6 1%   Portland s population has been and remains predominantly white  In 1940  whites were over 98% of the city s population  In 2009  Portland had the fifth highest percentage of white residents among the 40 largest U S  metropolitan areas  A 2007 survey of the 40 largest cities in the U S  concluded that Portland s urban core has the highest percentage of white residents  Some scholars have noted the Pacific Northwest as a whole is  one of the last Caucasian bastions of the United States   While Portland s diversity was historically comparable to metro Seattle and Salt Lake City  those areas grew more diverse in the late 1990s and 2000s  Portland not only remains white  but migration to Portland is disproportionately white  at least partly because Portland is attractive to young college educated Americans  a group which is overwhelmingly white   The Oregon Territory banned African American settlement in 1849  In the 19th century  certain laws allowed the immigration of Chinese laborers but prohibited them from owning property or bringing their families  The early 1920s saw the rapid growth of the Ku Klux Klan  which became very influential in Oregon politics  culminating in the election of Walter M  Pierce as governor   The largest influxes of minority populations occurred during World War II  as the African American population grew by a factor of 10 for wartime work  After World War II  the Vanport flood in 1948 displaced many African Americans  As they resettled  redlining directed the displaced workers from the wartime settlement to neighboring Albina  There and elsewhere in Portland  they experienced police hostility  lack of employment  and mortgage discrimination  leading to half the black population leaving after the war  Widespread housing discrimination continues to affect the racial landscape today   In the 1980s and 1990s  radical skinhead groups flourished in Portland  In 1988  Mulugeta Seraw  an Ethiopian immigrant  was killed by three skinheads  The response to his murder involved a community driven series of rallies  campaigns  nonprofits and events designed to address Portland s racial history  leading to a city considered significantly more tolerant than in 1988 at Seraw s death   During redevelopment of north Portland along the MAX Yellow Line  displacement of minorities occurred at a drastic rate  Out of 29 census tracts in north and northeast Portland  ten were majority nonwhite in 2000  By 2010  none of these tracts were majority nonwhite as gentrification drove the cost of living up  Today  Portland s African American community is concentrated in the north and northeast section of the city  mainly in the King neighborhood   4  Economy  Portland s location is beneficial for several industries  Relatively low energy cost  accessible resources  north–south and east–west Interstates  international air terminals  large marine shipping facilities  and both west coast intercontinental railroads are all economic advantages  The US consulting firm

the country s finest greenways  the 40 Mile Loop  which interconnects many of the city s parks  began   Portland is often cited as an example of a city with strong land use planning controls  This is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 1973 under Governor Tom McCall  in particular the requirement for an urban growth boundary  UGB  for every city and metropolitan area  The opposite extreme  a city with few or no controls  is typically illustrated by Houston  Texas   Portland s urban growth boundary  adopted in 1979  separates urban areas  where high density development is encouraged and focused  from traditional farm land  where restrictions on non agricultural development are very strict   This was atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways  in suburbs  and satellite cities   The original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries  but critics felt this wasn t being accomplished  In 1995  the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20 year supply of future housing at projected growth levels   Oregon s 1973  urban growth boundary  law limits the boundaries for large scale development in each metropolitan area in Oregon  This limits access to utilities such as sewage  water and telecommunications  as well as coverage by fire  police and schools  Originally this law mandated that the city must maintain enough land within the boundary to provide an estimated 20 years of growth  however  in 2007 the legislature altered the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary  as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands   The growth boundary  along with efforts of the PDC to create economic development zones  has led to the development of a large portion of downtown  a large number of mid  and high rise developments  and an overall increase in housing and business density   The Portland Development Commission is a semi public agency that plays a major role in downtown development  it was created by city voters in 1958 to serve as the city s urban renewal agency  It provides housing and economic development programs within the city  and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects   In the early 1960s  the PDC led the razing of a large Italian Jewish neighborhood downtown  bounded roughly by I 405  the Willamette River  4th Avenue and Market street   Mayor Neil Goldschmidt took office in 1972 as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area  which was seen as emptying out after 5 pm  The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since  with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas  north of Portland State University  between I 405  SW Broadway  and SW Taylor St    the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam  I 5  bridge  and most notably in the Pearl District  between I 405  Burnside St   NW Northrup St   and NW 9th Ave     The Urban Greenspaces

in 2012 the city council  responding to advocacy from public health organizations and others  voted unanimously to begin fluoridation by 2014  Fluoridation opponents forced a public vote on the issue  and on May 21  2013  city voters again rejected fluoridation   8 3  Free speech  Because of strong free speech protections of the Oregon Constitution upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court in State v  Henry  732 P 2d 9  Or  1987   which specifically found that full nudity and lap dances in strip clubs are protected speech  Portland is widely considered to have more strip clubs per capita than Las Vegas or San Francisco  Portland has been titled as  Pornland  for its strip clubs  erotic massage parlors  and high rate of child sex trafficking  The term was heavily used in 2010  but the term was referenced by Chuck Palahniuk in 2003   A judge dismissed charges against a nude bicyclist in November 2008 on the grounds that the city s annual World Naked Bike Ride was  a well established tradition  in Portland  The first instance occurred sometime around 1999 and had less than 7 participants  at the time it was jokingly referred to as  critical ass   a play on Critical Mass bike rides   Participants would  purchase  a bike from a local chain department store and then return it the next morning  It used to take place at midnight and lasted until the participants were stopped arrested  The prankster aspect of it came in when the arresting officers didn t want to touch the naked cyclists in order to arrest them  The 2009 Naked Bike Ride occurred without significant incident  City police managed traffic intersections  There were an estimated 3 000 to 5 000 participants  In June 2010  Portland s World Naked Bike Ride had an estimated 13 000 people   A state law prohibiting
