In information technology   lossy  compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations  or partial data discarding  for representing the content that has been encoded  Such compression techniques are used to reduce the amount of data that would otherwise be needed to store  handle  and or transmit the represented content  The different versions of the photo of the cat at the right demonstrate how the approximation of an image becomes progressively coarser as more details of the data that made up the original image are removed  The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression can often be much more substantial than what is possible with lossless data compression techniques   Using well designed lossy compression technology  a substantial amount of data reduction is often possible before the result is sufficiently degraded to be noticed by the user  Even when the degree of degradation becomes noticeable  further data reduction may often be desirable for some applications  e g   to make real time communication possible through a limited bit rate channel  to reduce the time needed to transmit the content  or to reduce the necessary storage capacity    Lossy compression is most commonly used to compress multimedia data  audio  video  and still images   especially in applications such as streaming media and internet telephony  By contrast  lossless compression is typically required for text and data files  such as bank records and text articles  In many cases it is advantageous to make a master lossless file that can then be used to produce compressed files for different purposes  for example  a multi megabyte file can be used at full size to produce a full page advertisement in a glossy magazine  and a 10 kilobyte lossy copy can be made for a small image on a web page   1  Lossy and lossless compression  It is possible to compress many types of digital data in a way that reduces the size of a computer file needed to store it  or the bandwidth needed to transmit it  with no loss of the full information contained in the original file  A picture  for example  is converted to a digital file by considering it to be an array of dots and specifying the color and brightness of each dot  If the picture contains an area of the same color  it can be compressed without loss by saying  200 red dots  instead of  red dot  red dot      197 more times      red dot    The original data contains a certain amount of information  and there is a lower limit to the size of file that can carry all the information  Basic information theory says that there is an absolute limit in reducing the size of this data  When data is compressed  its entropy increases  and it cannot increase indefinitely  As an intuitive example  most people know that a compressed ZIP file is smaller than the original file  but repeatedly compressing the same file will not reduce the size to nothing  Most compression algorithms can recognize when further compression would be pointless and would in fact increase the size of the data   In many cases  files or data streams contain more information than is needed for a particular purpose  For example  a picture may have more detail than the eye can distinguish when reproduced at the largest size intended  likewise  an audio file does not need a lot of fine detail during a very loud passage  Developing lossy compression techniques as closely matched to human perception as possible is a complex task  Sometimes the ideal is a file that provides exactly the same perception as the original  with as much digital information as possible removed  other times  perceptible loss of quality is considered a valid trade off for the reduced data   2  Transform coding  More generally  some forms of lossy compression can be thought of as an application of transform coding – in the case of multimedia data  perceptual coding  it transforms the raw data to a domain that more accurately reflects the information content  For example  rather than expressing a sound file as the amplitude levels over time  one may express it as the frequency spectrum over time  which corresponds more accurately to human audio perception   While data reduction  compression  be it lossy or lossless  is a main goal of transform coding  it also allows other goals  one may represent data more accurately for the original amount of space – for example  in principle  if one starts with an analog or high resolution digital master  an MP3 file of a given size should provide a better representation than a raw uncompressed audio in WAV or AIFF file of the same size  This is because uncompressed audio can only reduce file size by lowering bit rate or depth  whereas compressing audio can reduce size while maintaining bit rate and depth  This compression becomes a selective loss of the least significant data  rather than losing data across the board  Further  a transform coding may provide a better domain for manipulating or otherwise editing the data – for example  equalization of audio is most naturally expressed in the frequency domain  boost the bass  for instance  rather than in the raw time domain   From this point of view  perceptual encoding is not essentially about discarding data  but rather about a better representation of data   Another use is for backward compatibility and graceful degradation  in color television  encoding color via a luminance chrominance transform domain  such as YUV  means that black and white sets display the luminance  while ignoring the color information   Another example is chroma subsampling  the use of color spaces such as YIQ  used in NTSC  allow one to reduce the resolution on the components to accord with human perception – humans have highest resolution for black and white  luma   lower resolution for mid spectrum colors like yellow and green  and lowest for red and blues – thus NTSC displays approximately 350 pixels of luma per scanline  150 pixels of yellow vs  green  and 50 pixels of blue vs  red  which are proportional to human sensitivity to each component   3  Information loss  Lossy compression formats suffer from generation loss  repeatedly compressing and decompressing the file will cause it to progressively lose quality  This is in contrast with lossless data compression  where data will not be lost via the use of such a procedure   Information theoretical foundations for lossy data compression are provided by rate distortion theory  Much like the use of probability in optimal coding theory  rate distortion theory heavily draws on Bayesian estimation and decision theory in order to model perceptual distortion and even aesthetic judgment   There are two basic lossy compression schemes   In lossy transform codecs  samples of picture or sound are taken  chopped into small segments  transformed into a new basis space  and quantized  The resulting quantized values are then entropy coded   In lossy predictive codecs  previous and or subsequent decoded data is used to predict the current sound sample or image frame  The error between the predicted data and the real data  together with any extra information needed to reproduce the prediction  is then quantized and coded  In some systems the two techniques are combined  with transform codecs being used to compress the error signals generated by the predictive stage   4  Lossy versus lossless  The advantage of lossy methods over lossless methods is that in some cases a lossy method can produce a much smaller compressed file than any lossless method  while still meeting the requirements of the application   Lossy methods are most often used for compressing sound  images or videos  This is because these types of data are intended for human interpretation where the mind can easily  fill in the blanks  or see past very minor errors or inconsistencies – ideally lossy compression is transparent  imperceptible   which can be verified via an ABX test   4 1  Transparency  When a user acquires a lossily compressed file   for example  to reduce download time  the retrieved file can be quite different from the original at the bit level while being indistinguishable to the human ear or eye for most practical purposes  Many compression methods focus on the idiosyncrasies of human physiology  taking into account  for instance  that the human eye can see only certain wavelengths of light  The psychoacoustic model describes how sound can be highly compressed without degrading perceived quality  Flaws caused by lossy compression that are noticeable to the human eye or ear are known as compression artifacts   4 2  Compression ratio  The compression ratio  that is  the size of the compressed file compared to that of the uncompressed file  of lossy video codecs is nearly always far superior to that of the audio and still image equivalents   Video can be compressed immensely  e g  100 1  with little visible quality loss  Audio can often be compressed at 10 1 with imperceptible loss of quality  Still images are often lossily compressed at 10 1  as with audio  but the quality loss is more noticeable  especially on closer inspection   5  Transcoding and editing  An important caveat about lossy compression  formally transcoding   is that editing lossily compressed files causes digital generation loss from the re encoding  This can be avoided by only producing lossy files from  lossless  originals and only editing  copies of  original files  such as images in raw image format instead of JPEG   If data which has been compressed lossily is decoded and compressed losslessly  the size of the result can be comparable with the size of the data before lossy compression  but the data already lost cannot be recovered   When deciding to use lossy conversion without keeping the original  one should remember that format conversion may be needed in the future to achieve compatibility with software or devices  format shifting   or to avoid paying patent royalties for decoding or distribution of compressed files   5 1  Editing of lossy files  By modifying the compressed data directly without decoding and re encoding  some editing of lossily compressed files without degradation of quality is possible  Editing which reduces the file size as if it had been compressed to a greater degree  but without more loss than this  is sometimes also possible   5 1 1  JPEG  The primary programs for lossless editing of JPEGs are jpegtran  and the derived exiftran  which also preserves Exif information   and  which provides a Windows interface    These allow the image to be  cropped  rotated  flipped  and flopped  or  converted to grayscale  by dropping the chrominance channel   While unwanted information is destroyed  the quality of the remaining portion is unchanged   Some other transforms are possible to some extent  such as joining images with the same encoding  composing side by side  as on a grid  or pasting images  such as logos  onto existing images  both via    or scaling   Some changes can be made to the compression without re encoding   optimize the compression  to reduce size without change to the decoded image   convert between progressive and non progressive encoding  The freeware Windows only IrfanView has some lossless JPEG operations in its JPG TRANSFORM plugin   5 1 2  Metadata  Metadata  such as ID3 tags  Vorbis comments  or Exif information  can usually be modified or removed without modifying the underlying data   5 1 3  Downsampling compressed representation scalability  One may wish to downsample or otherwise decrease the resolution of the represented source signal and the quantity of data used for its compressed representation without re encoding  as in bitrate peeling  but this functionality is not supported in all designs  as not all codecs encode data in a form that allows less important detail to simply be dropped   Some well known designs that have this capability include JPEG 2000 for still images and H 264 MPEG 4 AVC based Scalable Video Coding for video  Such schemes have also been standardized for older designs as well  such as JPEG images with progressive encoding  and MPEG 2 and MPEG 4 Part 2 video  although those prior schemes had limited success in terms of adoption into real world common usage   Without this capacity  which is often the case in practice  to produce a representation with lower resolution or lower fidelity than a given one  one needs to start with the original source signal and encode  or start with a compressed representation and then decompress and re encode it  transcoding   though the latter tends to cause digital generation loss   Another approach is to encode the original signal at several different bitrates  and their either choose which to use  as when streaming over the internet – as in RealNetworks   SureStream  – or offering varying downloads  as at Apple s iTunes Store   or broadcast several  where the best that is successfully received is used  as in various implementations of hierarchical modulation  Similar techniques are used in mipmaps  pyramid representations  and more sophisticated scale space methods   Some audio formats feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction which when combined reproduce the original signal  the correction can be stripped  leaving a smaller  lossily compressed  file  Such formats include MPEG 4 SLS  Scalable to Lossless   WavPack  and OptimFROG

substitute short words for long ones  or generative text techniques  although these sometimes fall into the related category of lossy data conversion   7  Lowering resolution  A general kind of lossy compression is to lower the resolution of an image  as in image scaling  particularly decimation  One may also remove less  lower information  parts of an image  such as by seam carving   Many media transforms  such as Gaussian blur  are  like lossy compression  irreversible  the original signal cannot be reconstructed from the transformed signal  However  in general these will have the same size as the original  and are not a form of compression   Lowering resolution has practical uses  as the NASA New Horizons craft will transmit thumbnails of its encounter with Pluto Charon before it sends the higher resolution images   Another solution for slow connections is the usage of Image interlacing which progressively defines the image  Thus a partial transmission is enough to preview the final image  in a lower resolution version  without creating a scaled and a full version too   8  See also  Data compression  Lossless data compression  Compression artifact  Rate–distortion theory  List of
