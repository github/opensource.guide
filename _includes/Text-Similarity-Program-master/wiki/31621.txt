A transient ischemic attack  TIA  is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by ischemia  loss of blood flow  – either focal brain  spinal cord  or retinal – without acute infarction  tissue death   TIAs have the same underlying cause as strokes  a disruption of cerebral blood flow  CBF   and are often referred to as mini strokes  This is different from the definition of TIA used before 2009  which was based on the temporal  arbitrary time point of   24 hours of associated neurological symptoms  TIAs cause the same symptoms associated with stroke  such as contralateral paralysis  opposite side of body from affected brain hemisphere  or sudden weakness or numbness  A TIA may cause sudden dimming or loss of vision  amaurosis fugax   aphasia  slurred speech  dysarthria  and mental confusion  But unlike a stroke  the symptoms of a TIA can resolve within a few minutes or 24 hours  Brain injury may still occur in a TIA lasting only a few minutes  Having a TIA is a risk factor for eventually having a stroke or a silent stroke   A silent stroke or silent cerebral infarct  SCI  differs from a TIA in that there are no immediately observable symptoms  An SCI may still cause long lasting neurological dysfunction affecting such areas as mood  personality and cognition  An SCI often occurs before or after a TIA or major stroke   A cerebral infarct that lasts longer than 24 hours but fewer than 72 hours is called a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit or RIND   1  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms can vary widely from person to person  depending on the area of the brain involved  The most frequent symptoms include temporary loss of vision  typically amaurosis fugax   difficulty speaking  aphasia   weakness on one side of the body  hemiparesis   and numbness or tingling  paresthesia   usually on one side of the body  Impairment of consciousness is very uncommon  There have been cases of temporary and partial paralysis affecting the face and tongue of the afflicted  The symptoms of a TIA are short lived and usually last a few seconds to a few minutes and most symptoms disappear within 60 minutes  Some individuals may have a lingering feeling that something odd happened to the body  Dizziness  lack of coordination or poor balance are also symptoms related to TIA  Symptoms vary in severity   2  Causes  The most common cause of a TIA is an embolus that occludes an artery in the brain  This usually arises from a dislodged atherosclerotic plaque in one of the carotid arteries  i e  two of the four major arteries supplying the brain  or from the vertebral basilar arteries  Another common cause is from a thrombus  i e  a blood clot  that has originated from the  usually left  atrium of the heart due to atrial fibrillation  In a TIA  the blockage period is very short lived and hence there is no permanent damage  The cholesterol build up is gradual and eventually narrows the lumen  With time  blood flow to that side of the brain is reduced and a stroke may occur as a result  In other cases  cholesterol particles from the atherosclerotic plaque may suddenly break off and enter the brain  In some people  these fragments come off from the heart and go to the brain  This often happens during a heart attack or an infection of the valves   Other reasons include excessive narrowing of large vessels resulting from an atherosclerotic plaque and increased blood viscosity caused by some blood diseases  TIA is related to other medical conditions such as hypertension  heart disease  especially atrial fibrillation   migraine  hypercholesterolemia  and diabetes mellitus   2 1  Risk factors  Family history of stroke or TIA substantially increases risk   People 55 years or older are at higher risk   Males have a slightly higher risk of TIA than females but females are more likely to die from a stroke   High blood pressure  Diabetes Mellitus  Tobacco smoking  3  Diagnosis  TIA will usually be diagnosed after a doctor performs a history and a physical exam  There are several radiological tests that are done to evaluate patients who have had a TIA  These include a CT scan or an MRI of the brain  ultrasound of the neck  or an echocardiogram of the heart  In most cases  the source of atherosclerosis is usually identified with an ultrasound   3 1  Differential diagnoses  Other diagnoses may have symptoms similar to those of a TIA   Atypical migraine if visual symptoms occur such as the perception of wavy or jagged lines or tiny specks of light and if a headache occurs  Typically a history of prior migraines is present   Partial seizure in the parietal area of the brain  Glucose abnormalities  these could be distinguished by a history of diabetes mellitus and a loss of consciousness  Electrolyte abnormalities  Hypertensive encephalopathy  headache  delirium  hypertension  cerebral edema   Subdural hematoma  history of trauma  headache  loss of consciousness   Brain tumor  mode of onset  progressive headaches  increased intracranial pressure   Demyelinating disease  Conversion disorder  4  Prevention  A TIA may be prevented by changes in lifestyle  although most of these recommendations have no solid empirical data  most medical professionals believe them to be so  These include   Avoiding smoking  Cutting down on fats to help reduce the amount of plaque build up  Eating a healthy diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables  Limiting sodium in the diet  thereby reducing blood pressure  Exercising regularly  Moderating alcohol intake  Maintaining a healthy weight  Controlling blood pressure and blood sugars  5  Treatment and management  The mainstay of the treatment following acute recovery from a TIA depends on the underlying cause  It is not always immediately possible to tell the difference between a CVA  stroke  and a TIA  Most patients who are diagnosed at a hospital s emergency department as having suffered from a TIA will be admitted to the hospital if it is their first TIA  for telemetry  blood pressure monitoring and other specific tests  If it is a second or subsequent TIA  most patients will be discharged home and advised to contact their primary physician to organize further investigations  A TIA can be considered as the last warning  The reason for the condition should be immediately examined by imaging of the brain  Occasionally  none of these tests will determine the cause  but the symptoms show that the stroke did occur  Actually TIA is a form of stroke in nature   To reduce risk of recurrence  patients are recommended to undergo lifestyle changes including quitting smoking  losing weight  eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising regularly   5 1  Surgery  If the TIA affects an area that is supplied by the carotid arteries  an ultrasound  TCD  scan may demonstrate carotid stenosis  For people with a greater than 70% stenosis within the carotid artery  removal of atherosclerotic plaque by surgery  specifically a carotid endarterectomy  may be recommended  The blood vessel is opened up and the plaque is removed  The carotid may be replaced with a vessel retrieved from the lower leg or foot  The procedure is not technically difficult but carries the potential complication of inducing a stroke  A stroke can occur during surgery or after the procedure  The chance of a stroke ranges from 1–4 percent   Some patients may also be given modified release dipyridamole or clopidogrel   5 2  Medication  The use of anti coagulant medications  heparin and warfarin  or anti platelet medications such as aspirin may be warranted  Antiplatelet drugs prevent platelets from agglutinating or sticking to each other  hence the term  blood thinner   The initial treatment is aspirin  second line is clopidogrel  PLAVIX   third line is ticlopidine  If TIA is recurrent after aspirin treatment  the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole is needed  Aggrenox    Thinning the blood helps to ensure that small particles do not form and travel to the brain  These drugs require frequent monitoring  These drugs also have side effects such as easy bruising and bleeding from mild trauma   An electrocardiogram  ECG  may show atrial fibrillation  a common cause of TIAs  or other arrhythmias that may cause embolisation to the brain  An echocardiogram is useful in detecting thrombus within the heart chambers  Such patients benefit from anticoagulation   6  Prognosis  People diagnosed with TIA are sometimes said to have had a warning for an approaching stroke  If the time period of blood supply impairment lasts more than a few minutes  the nerve cells of that area of the brain die and cause permanent neurologic damage  One third of the people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one third have a stroke because of permanent nerve cell loss  Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop stroke within 90 days  half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA  The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the ABCD² score   7  References
