The Precambrian  or Pre Cambrian  sometimes abbreviated pЄ  is the largest span of time in Earth s history before the current Phanerozoic Eon  and is a Supereon divided into several eons of the geologic time scale  It spans from the formation of Earth about 4 6 billion years ago  Ga  to the beginning of the Cambrian Period  about million years ago  Ma   when hard shelled creatures first appeared in abundance  The Precambrian is so named because it precedes the Cambrian  the first period of the Phanerozoic Eon  which is named after Cambria  the classical name for Wales  where rocks from this age were first studied  The Precambrian accounts for 88% of geologic time   1  Overview  Relatively little is known about the Precambrian  despite it making up roughly seven eighths of the Earth s history  and what is known has largely been discovered in the past 50 years  The Precambrian fossil record is poorer than that of the succeeding Phanerozoic  and those fossils present  e g  stromatolites  are of limited biostratigraphic use  This is because many Precambrian rocks have been heavily metamorphosed  obscuring their origins  while others have been destroyed by erosion  or remain deeply buried beneath Phanerozoic strata   It is thought that the Earth itself coalesced from material in orbit around the Sun roughly 4500 Ma  or 4 5 billion years ago  Ga   and may have been struck by a very large  Mars sized  planetesimal shortly after it formed  splitting off material that formed the Moon  see Giant impact hypothesis   A stable crust was apparently in place by 4400 Ma  since zircon crystals from Western Australia have been dated at 4404 Ma   The term Precambrian is recognized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a general term including the Archean and Proterozoic eons  It is still used by geologists and paleontologists for general discussions not requiring the more specific eon names  It was briefly also called the Cryptozoic eon   2  Life before the Cambrian  It is not known when life originated  but carbon in 3 8 billion year old rocks from islands off western Greenland may be of organic origin  Well preserved bacteria older than 3 46 billion years have been found in Western Australia  Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area  There is a fairly solid record of bacterial life throughout the remainder of the Precambrian   Excluding a few contested reports of much older forms from USA and India  the first complex multicellular life forms seem to have appeared roughly 600 Ma  The oldest fossil evidence of complex life comes from the Lantian formation  at least 580 million years ago  A quite diverse collection of soft bodied forms is known from a variety of locations worldwide between 542 and 600 Ma  These are referred to as Ediacaran or Vendian biota  Hard shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span  By the middle of the later Cambrian period a very diverse fauna is recorded in the Burgess Shale  including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa  The rapid radiation of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the Cambrian explosion of life   While land seems to have been devoid of plants and animals  cyanobacteria and other microbes formed prokaryotic mats that covered terrestrial areas   3  Planetary environment and the oxygen catastrophe  Evidence illuminating the details of plate motions and other tectonic functions in the Precambrian has been poorly preserved  It is generally believed that small proto continents existed prior to 3000 Ma  and that most of the Earth s landmasses collected into a single supercontinent around 1000 Ma  The supercontinent  known as Rodinia  broke up around 600 Ma  A number of glacial periods have been identified going as far back as the Huronian epoch  roughly 2200 Ma  One of the most delved into is the Sturtian Varangian glaciation  around 600 Ma  which may have brought glacial conditions all the way to the equator  resulting in a  Snowball Earth    The atmosphere of the early Earth is not well understood  Most geologists believe it was composed primarily of nitrogen  carbon dioxide  and other relatively inert gases  lacking in free oxygen  This has been disputed with evidence in support of an oxygen rich atmosphere since the early Archean   Molecular oxygen was not present as a significant fraction of Earth s atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism  This radical shift from an inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe  At first  oxygen would quickly combine with other elements in Earth s crust  primarily iron  as it was produced  After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out  oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere  and the modern high oxygen atmosphere developed  Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations  laid down as iron and oxygen first combined   4  Subdivisions  An established terminology has evolved covering the early years of the Earth s existence  as radiometric dating allows plausible real dates to be assigned to specific formations and features  The Precambrian Supereon is divided into three Precambrian eons  the Hadean  4500 3950 Ma   Archean    Ma  and Proterozoic    Ma   See Timetable of the Precambrian   Proterozoic  this eon refers to the time from the lower Cambrian boundary  Ma  back through Ma  As originally used  it was a synonym for  Precambrian  and hence included everything prior to the Cambrian boundary  The Proterozoic eon is divided into three eras  the Neoproterozoic  Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic   Neoproterozoic  The youngest geologic era of the Proterozoic Eon  from the Cambrian Period lower boundary   Ma  back to Ma  The Neoproterozoic corresponds to Precambrian Z rocks of older North American geology   Ediacaran  The youngest geologic period within the Neoproterozoic Era  The  2012 Geologic Time Scale  dates it from to Ma  In this period the Ediacaran fauna appeared   Cryogenian  The middle period in the Neoproterozoic Era    Ma   Tonian  the earliest period of the Neoproterozoic Era    Ma   Mesoproterozoic  the middle era of the Proterozoic Eon    Ma  Corresponds to  Precambrian Y  rocks of older North American geology   Paleoproterozoic  oldest era of the Proterozoic Eon    Ma  Corresponds to  Precambrian X  rocks of older North American geology   Archean Eon    Ma   Hadean Eon  3950 4500 Ma  This term was intended originally to cover the time before any preserved rocks were deposited  although some zircon crystals from about 4400 Ma demonstrate the existence of crust in the Hadean Eon  Other records from Hadean time come from the moon and meteorites  It has been proposed that the Precambrian should be divided into eons and eras that reflect stages of planetary evolution  rather than the current scheme based upon numerical ages  Such a system could rely on events in the stratigraphic record and be demarcated by GSSPs  The Precambrian could be divided into five  natural  eons  characterized as follows   Accretion and differentiation  a period of planetary formation until giant Moon forming impact event   Hadean  dominated by heavy bombardment from about 4 51   possibly including a Cool Early Earth period  to the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment period   Archean  a period defined by the first crustal formations  the Isua greenstone belt  until the deposition of banded iron formations due to increasing atmospheric oxygen content   Transition  a period of continued iron banded formation until the first continental red beds   Proterozoic  a period of modern plate tectonics until the first animals   5  Precambrian super continents  The movement of plates has caused the formation and break up of continents over time  including occasional formation of a super continent containing most or all of the continents  The earliest known super continent was Vaalbara  It formed from proto continents and was a super continent by 3 1 billion years ago  3 1 Ga   Vaalbara broke up ~2 8 Ga ago  The super continent Kenorland was formed ~2 7 Ga ago and then broke sometime after 2 5 Ga into the proto continent Cratons called Laurentia  Baltica  Australia  and Kalahari  The super continent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2 0–1 8 billion years and broke up about 1 5–1 3 billion years ago The super continent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago  to have embodied most or all of Earth s continents and to have broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago   6  See also
