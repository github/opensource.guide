Romantic nationalism  also national romanticism  organic nationalism  identity nationalism  is the form of nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs  This includes  depending on the particular manner of practice  the language  race  culture  religion  and customs of the  nation  in its primal sense of those who were  born  within its culture  This form of nationalism arose in reaction to dynastic or imperial hegemony  which assessed the legitimacy of the state from the  top down   emanating from a monarch or other authority  which justified its existence  Such downward radiating power might ultimately derive from a god or gods  see the divine right of kings and the Mandate of Heaven    Among the key themes of Romanticism  and its most enduring legacy  the cultural assertions of romantic nationalism have also been central in post Enlightenment art and political philosophy  From its earliest stirrings  with their focus on the development of national languages and folklore  and the spiritual value of local customs and traditions  to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for  self determination  of nationalities  nationalism was one of the key issues in Romanticism  determining its roles  expressions and meanings   1  Brief history  The ideas of Rousseau  1712 1778  and of Johann Gottfried von Herder  1744 1803  inspired much early Romantic nationalism in Europe  In 1784 Herder argued that geography formed the natural economy of a people  and that their customs and society would develop along the lines that their basic environment favored   From its beginnings in the late 18th century  romantic nationalism has relied upon the existence of a historical ethnic culture which meets the romantic ideal  folklore developed as a romantic nationalist concept  The Brothers Grimm  inspired by Herder s writings  put together an idealized collection of tales  which they labeled as authentically German  The concept of an inherited cultural patrimony from a common origin rapidly became central to a divisive question within romantic nationalism  specifically  is a nation unified because it comes from the same genetic source  that is because of race  or is the participation in the organic nature of the  folk  culture self fulfilling   Romantic nationalism formed a key strand in the philosophy of Hegel  1770 1831   who argued that there was a  spirit of the age  or zeitgeist that inhabited a particular people at a particular time  and that  when that people became the active determiner of history  it was simply because their cultural and political moment had come  Because of the Germans  role in the Protestant Reformation  Hegel  a Lutheran  argued that his historical moment had seen the Zeitgeist settle on the German speaking peoples   In continental Europe  Romantics had embraced the French Revolution in its beginnings  then found themselves fighting the counter Revolution in the trans national Imperial system of Napoleon  The sense of self determination and national consciousness that had enabled revolutionary forces to defeat aristocratic regimes in battle became rallying points for resistance against the French Empire  1804 1814   In Prussia  the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in the struggle against Napoleon was argued by  among others  Johann Gottlieb Fichte  1762 1814   a disciple of Kant  The word Volkstum  or  folkhood   was coined in Germany as part of this resistance to French hegemony   Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his thirteenth address  To the German Nation  in 1806   1 1  Nationalism and revolution  In the Balkans  Romantic views of a connection with classical Greece  which inspired Philhellenism infused the Greek War of Independence  1821 1832   in which the Romantic poet Lord Byron died of high fever  Rossini s opera William Tell  1829  marked the onset of the Romantic Opera  using the central national myth unifying Switzerland  and in Brussels  a riot  August 1830  after an opera that set a doomed romance against a background of foreign oppression  Auber s La Muette de Portici  sparked the Belgian Revolution of 1830 1831  the first successful revolution in the model of Romantic nationalism  Verdi s opera choruses of an oppressed people inspired two generations of patriots in Italy  especially with  Va pensiero   Nabucco  1842   Under the influence of romantic nationalism  among economic and political forces  both Germany and Italy found political unity  and movements to create nations similarly based upon ethnic groups would flower in the Balkans  see for example  the Carinthian Plebiscite  1920   along the Baltic Sea  and in the interior of Central Europe  where in the eventual outcome  the Habsburgs succumbed to the surge of Romantic nationalism  In Norway  romanticism was embodied  not in literature  but in the movement toward a national style  both in architecture and in ethos  Earlier  there was a strong romantic nationalist element mixed with Enlightenment rationalism in the rhetoric used in British North America  in the colonists  Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution of 1787  as well as the rhetoric in the wave of revolts  inspired by new senses of localized identities  which swept the American colonies of Spain  one after the other  from 1811   1 2  Language  Romantic nationalism inspired the processes whereby folk epics  retold legends and even fairy tales  published in existing dialects  were combined with a modern syntax to create a  revived  version of a language  Romantic nationalists expected patriots to then learn that language and raise their children speaking that language – as part of a general program to establish a unique identity   Landsmål   which is the foundation of a form of Norwegian used by 10% of the population  mostly in western Norway  was the first language to follow this program  and it was joined by modern Czech  Slovak  Finnish and later by Hebrew as nationalizing languages  Katharevousa Greek was constructed as a form of Modern Greek drawing on classical Greek morphology and vocabulary in an attempt to purify the existing demotic Greek   The linguistic processes of romantic nationalism demanded linguistic culture models  Romantic historiography was centered on biographies and produced culture heroes  The modern Itahlian of Risorgimento patriots like Alessandro Manzoni was based on the Tuscan dialects sanctified by Dante and Petrarch  In English  Shakespeare became an iconic figure  though not a modern linguistic model    1 3  Folk culture  Romantic nationalism inspired the collection of folklore by such people as the Brothers Grimm  The view that fairy tales  unless contaminated from outside literary sources  were preserved in the same form over thousands of years  was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists  but it fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people   The Brothers Grimm were criticized because their first edition was insufficiently German  and they followed the advice  They rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by Charles Perrault  which they thought proved they were not truly German tales  Sleeping Beauty survived in their collection because the tale of Brynhildr convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German  They also altered the language used  changing each  Fee   fairy  to an enchantress or wise woman  every  prince  to a  king s son   every  princess  to a  king s daughter   Discussing these views in their third editions  they particularly singled out Giambattista Basile s Pentamerone as the first national collection of fairy tales  and as capturing Neapolitan voice   The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors  both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it  to the neglect of cross cultural influence  Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev  the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe  and the Englishman Joseph Jacobs   Many artists and writers also drew on their native countries folklore and folktunes for their own work to express their nationalism   1 4  National epics  The concept of a  national epic   an extensively mythologized legendary work of poetry of defining importance to a certain nation  is another product of Romantic nationalism  The  discovery  of Beowulf in a single manuscript  first transcribed in 1818  came under the impetus of Romantic nationalism  after the manuscript had lain as an ignored curiosity in scholars  collections for two centuries  Beowulf was felt to provide people self identified as  Anglo Saxon  with their missing  national epic   just when the need for it was first being felt  the fact that Beowulf himself was a Geat was easily overlooked  The pseudo Gaelic literary forgeries of  Ossian  had failed  finally  to fill the need for the first Romantic generation   The first publication of The Tale of Igor s Campaign coincided with the rise in Russian national spirit in the wake of the Napoleonic wars and Suvorov s campaigns in Central Europe  The unseen and unheard Song of Roland had become a dim memory  until the antiquary Francisque Michel transcribed a worn copy in the Bodleian Library and put it into print in 1837  it was timely  French interest in the national epic revived among the Romantic generation  In Greece  the Iliad and Odyssey took on new urgency during the Greek War of Independence   Many other  national epics   epic poetry considered to reflect the national spirit  were produced or revived under the influence of Romantic nationalism  particularly in the Russian Empire  national minorities seeking to assert their own identities in the face of Russification produced new national poetry – either out of whole cloth  or from cobbling together folk poetry  or by resurrecting older narrative poetry  Examples include the Estonian Kalevipoeg  Finnish Kalevala  Polish Pan Tadeusz  Latvian Lāčplēsis  Armenian Sasuntzi Davit by Hovhannes Tumanyan  and Georgian The Knight in the Panther s Skin   2  Claims of primacy or superiority  At the same time  linguistic and cultural nationality  colored with pre genetic concepts of race  bolstered two rhetorical claims consistently associated with romantic nationalism to this day  claims of primacy and claims of superiority  Primacy is the claimed inalienable right of a culturally and racially defined people to a geographical terrain  a  heartland   a vivid expression  or homeland  The polemics of racial superiority became inexorably intertwined with romantic nationalism  Richard Wagner notoriously argued that those who were ethnically different could not comprehend the artistic and cultural meaning inherent in national culture  Identifying  Jewishness  even in musical style  he specifically attacked the Jews as being unwilling to assimilate into German culture  and thus unable to truly comprehend the mysteries of its music and language  Sometimes  national epics  such as the Nibelunglied have had a galvanizing effect on social politics   2 1  Arts  After the 1870s  national romanticism   as it is more usually called  became a familiar movement in the arts  Romantic musical nationalism is exemplified by the work of Bedřich Smetana  especially the symphonic poem  Vltava   In Scandinavia and the Slavic parts of Europe especially   national romanticism  provided a series of answers to the 19th century search for styles that would be culturally meaningful and evocative  yet not merely historicist  When a church was built over the spot in St Petersburg where Tsar Alexander II of Russia had been assassinated  the  Church of the Savior on Blood   the natural style to use was one that best evoked traditional Russian features  illustration  left   In Finland  the reassembly of the national epic  the Kalevala  inspired paintings and murals in the National Romantic style that substituted there for the international Art Nouveau styles  The foremost proponent in Finland was Akseli Gallen Kallela  illustration  below right    By the turn of the century  ethnic self determination had become an assumption held as being progressive and liberal  There were romantic nationalist movements for separation in Finland  the Kingdom of Bavaria held apart from a united Germany  and Czech and Serb nationalism continued to trouble Imperial politics  The flowering of arts which drew inspiration from national epics and song continued unabated  The Zionist movement revived Hebrew  and began immigration to Eretz Yisrael  and Welsh and Irish tongues also experienced a poetic revival   2 2  Twentieth century political developments  In the first two decades of the 20th century  Romantic Nationalism as an idea was to have crucial influence on political events  Following the Panic of 1873 that gave rise to a new wave of anti Semitism and racism in the German Empire politically ruled by an authoritarian  militaristic conservatism under Otto von Bismarck and in parallel with a wide revival of irrational emotionalism known as Fin de siècle  also reflected to a degree in the contemporary art movements of symbolism  the Decadénce movement  and Art Nouveau   the racist  so called völkisch movement grew out of Romantic nationalism during the last third of the 19th century  to some extent modelling itself on British Imperialism and  the White Man s Burden   The idea was that Germans should  naturally  rule over lesser peoples  Romantic nationalism  which had begun as a revolt against  foreign  kings and overlords  had come full circle  and was being used to make the case for a  Greater Germanic Empire  which would rule over Europe   The nationalistic and imperialistic tensions rising high between the European nations throughout the irrational  neo Romantic Fin de siècle period eventually erupted in the First World War  After Germany had lost the war and undergone the tumultuous German Revolution  the völkisch movement drastically radicalized itself in Weimar Germany under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles  and Adolf Hitler would go on to say that  the basic ideas of National Socialism are völkisch  just as the völkisch ideas are National Socialist    Outside of Germany  the belief among European powers was that nation states forming around unities of language  culture and ethnicity were  natural  in some sense  For this reason President Woodrow Wilson would argue for the creation of self determining states in the wake of the Great War  However  the belief in romantic nationalism would be honored in the breach  In redrawing the map of Europe  Yugoslavia was created as an intentional coalition state among competing  and often mutually hostile  southern Slavic peoples  and the League of Nations  mandates were often drawn  not to unify ethnic groups  but to divide them  To take one example  the nation now known as Iraq intentionally joined together three Ottoman vilayets  uniting Kurds in the north  Sunni Arabs in the center  and Shia Arabs in the south  in an effort to present a strong national buffer state between Turkey and Persia  over these was placed a foreign king from the Hashemite dynasty native to the Hijaz   Because of the broad range of expressions of romantic nationalism  it is listed as a contributing factor from everything from the creation of independent states in Europe  to the rise of Nazi Germany  As an idea  if not a specific movement  it is present as an assumption in debates over nationality and nationhood even today  and many of the world s nations were created from principles drawn from romantic nationalism as their source of legitimacy   3  See also  Conservatism  Scandinavism  Norwegian romantic nationalism  German question  Slavophiles  Pochvennichestvo  Britishness
