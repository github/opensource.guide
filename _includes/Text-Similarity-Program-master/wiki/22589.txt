In Classical Antiquity  an oracle was a person or agency considered to provide wise counsel or prophetic predictions or precognition of the future  inspired by the gods  As such it is a form of divination   1  Description  The word oracle comes from the Latin verb ōrāre  to speak  and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction  In extended use  oracle may also refer to the site of the oracle  and to the oracular utterances themselves  called khrēsmoi  χρησμοί  in Greek   Oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people  In this sense they were different from seers  manteis  μάντεις  who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs  animal entrails  and other various methods   The most important oracles of Greek antiquity were Pythia  priestess to Apollo at Delphi  and the oracle of Dione and Zeus at Dodona in Epirus  Other temples of Apollo were located at Didyma on the coast of Asia Minor  at Corinth and Bassae in the Peloponnese  and at the islands of Delos and Aegina in the Aegean Sea  The Sibylline Oracles are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters ascribed to the Sibyls  prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in a frenzied state   2  Origins  Walter Burkert observes that  Frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks  are recorded in the Near East as in Mari in the second millennium BC and in Assyria in the first millennium BC  In Egypt the goddess Wadjet  eye of the moon  was depicted as a snake headed woman or a woman with two snake heads  Her oracle was in the renowned temple in Per Wadjet  Greek name Buto   The oracle of Wadjet may have been the source for the oracular tradition which spread from Egypt to Greece  Evans linked Wadjet with the Minoan snake goddess  a chthonic deity and one of the aspects of the Great Mother   In Greece the old oracles were devoted to the Mother Goddess  At the oracle of Dodona she will be called Diōnē  the feminine form of Diós  genitive of Zeus  PIE *Dyaeus  or of dīos   godly   literally  heavenly    who represents the earth fertile soil  probably the chief female goddess of the PIE pantheon  Python  daughter  or son  of Gaia was the earth dragon of Delphi represented as a serpent and became the chthonic deity  enemy of Apollo  who slew her and possessed the oracle   3  Pythia  Pythia  the oracle at Delphi  was said to be infallible  Pythia only gave prophecies the seventh day of each month  seven being the number most associated with Apollo  during the nine warmer months of the year  thus  Delphi was not the major source of divination for the ancient Greeks  Many wealthy individuals bypassed the hordes of people attempting a consultation by making additional animal sacrifices to please the oracle lest their request go unanswered  As a result  seers were the main source of everyday divination   The temple was changed to a center for the worship of Apollo during the classical period of Greece and priests were added to the temple organization—although the tradition regarding prophecy remained unchanged—and the priestesses continued to provide the services of the oracle exclusively  It is from this institution that the English word  oracle  is derived   The Delphic Oracle exerted considerable influence throughout Hellenic culture  Distinctively  this female was essentially the highest authority both civilly and religiously in male dominated ancient Greece  She responded to the questions of citizens  foreigners  kings  and philosophers on issues of political impact  war  duty  crime  laws—even personal issues   The semi Hellenic countries around the Greek world  such as Lydia  Caria  and even Egypt also respected her and came to Delphi as supplicants   Croesus  king of Lydia beginning in 560 B C   tested the oracles of the world to discover which gave the most accurate prophecies  He sent out emissaries to seven sites who were all to ask the oracles on the same day what the king was doing at that very moment  Croesus proclaimed the oracle at Delphi to be the most accurate  who correctly reported that the king was making a lamb and tortoise stew  and so he graced her with a magnitude of precious gifts  He then consulted Delphi before attacking Persia  and according to Herodotus was advised   If you cross the river  a great empire will be destroyed   Believing the response favorable  Croesus attacked  but it was his own empire that ultimately was destroyed by the Persians   She allegedly also proclaimed that there was no man wiser than Socrates  to which Socrates said that  if so  this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance  After this confrontation  Socrates dedicated his life to a search for knowledge that was one of the founding events of western philosophy  He claimed that she was  an essential guide to personal and state development   This Oracle s last recorded response was given in 362 AD  to Julian the Apostate   The oracle s powers were highly sought after and never doubted  Any inconsistencies between prophecies and events were dismissed as failure to correctly interpret the responses  not an error of the oracle  Very often prophecies were worded ambiguously  so as to cover all contingencies – especially so ex post facto  One famous such response to a query about participation in a military campaign was  You will go you will return never in war will you perish   This gives the recipient liberty to place a comma before or after the word  never   thus covering both possible outcomes  Another was the response to the Athenians when the vast army of king Xerxes I was approaching Athens with the intent of razing the city to the ground   Only the wooden palisades may save you   answered the oracle  probably aware that there was sentiment for sailing to the safety of southern Italy and reestablishing Athens there  Some thought that it was a recommendation to fortify the Acropolis with a wooden fence and make a stand there  Others  Themistocles among them  said the oracle was clearly for fighting at sea  the metaphor intended to mean war ships  Others still insisted that their case was so hopeless that they should board every ship available and flee to Italy  where they would be safe beyond any doubt  In the event  variations of all three interpretations were attempted  some barricaded the Acropolis  the civilian population was evacuated over sea to nearby Salamis Island and to Troizen  and the war fleet fought victoriously at Salamis Bay  Should utter destruction have happened  it could always be claimed that the oracle had called for fleeing to Italy after all   4  Dodona  Dodona was another oracle devoted to the Mother Goddess identified at other sites with Rhea or Gaia  but here called Dione  The shrine of Dodona was the oldest Hellenic oracle  according to the fifth century historian Herodotus and in fact  dates to pre Hellenic times  perhaps as early as the second millennium BC when the tradition probably spread from Egypt  Zeus displaced the Mother goddess and assimilated her as Aphrodite   It became the second most important oracle in ancient Greece  which later was dedicated to Zeus and to Heracles during the classical period of Greece  At Dodona Zeus was worshipped as Zeus Naios or Naos  god of springs Naiads  from a spring which existed under the oak   and Zeus Bouleos  cancellor   Priestesses and priests interpreted the rustling of the oak leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken  The oracle was shared by Dione and Zeus   5  Trophonius  Trophonius was an oracle at Lebadea of Boeotia devoted to the chthonian Zeus Trophonius  Trophonius is derived from the Greek word  trepho   nourish  and he was a Greek hero  or demon or god  Demeter Europa was his nurse  Europa  in Greek  broad eyes  was a Phoenecian princess who Zeus transformed into a white bull abducted and carried her to Creta  and is equated with Astarte as a moon goddess by ancient sources  Some scholars connect Astarte with the Minoan snake goddess  whose cult as Aphrodite spread from Creta to Greece   6   Oracles  in other cultures  The term  oracle  is also applied to parallel institutions of divination in other cultures  Specifically  it is used in the context of Christianity for the concept of divine revelation  and in the context of Judaism for the Urim and Thummim breastplate  and in general any utterance considered prophetic   6 1  China  Oracles were common in many civilizations of antiquity  In China  the use of oracle bones dates as far back as the Shang Dynasty   1600–1046 BC   The I Ching  or  Book of Changes   is a collection of linear signs used as oracles that are from that period  Although divination with the I Ching is thought to have originated prior to the Shang Dynasty  it was not until King Wu of Zhou  1046–1043 BC  that it took its present form  In addition to its oracular power  the I Ching has had a major influence on the philosophy  literature and statecraft of China from the time of the Zhou Dynasty  1122 BC – AD 256    6 2  Celtic polytheism  In Celtic polytheism  divination was performed by the priestly caste  either the druids or the vates  This is reflected in the role of  seers  in Dark Age Wales  dryw  and Ireland  fáith    6 3  Hinduism  In ancient India  the oracle was known as Akashwani or Ashareera vani  a person without body or unseen   or Asariri  Tamil   literally meaning  voice from the sky  and was related to the message of god  Oracles played key roles in many of the major incidents of the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana  An example is that Kamsa  or Kansa   the evil uncle of lord Krishna  was informed by an oracle that the eighth son of his sister Devaki would kill him  There are still a few existing and publicly accessible oracles in India   6 4  Tibetan Buddhism  In Tibet  oracles have played  and continue to play  an important part in religion and government  The word  oracle  is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit that enters those men and women who act as media between the natural and the spiritual realms  The media are  therefore  known as kuten  which literally means   the physical basis    The Dalai Lama  who lives in exile in northern India  still consults an oracle known as the Nechung Oracle  which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet  The Dalai Lama has according to centuries old custom  consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of Losar  Nechung and Gadhong are the primary oracles currently consulted  former oracles such as Karmashar and Darpoling are no longer active in exile  Another oracle the Dalai Lama consults is the Tenma Oracle  for which a young Tibetan woman is the medium for the goddess  The Dalai Lama gives a complete description of the process of trance and spirit possession in his book Freedom in Exile     6 5  Pre Columbian Americas  In the migration myth of the Mexitin  i e   the early Aztecs  a mummy bundle  perhaps an effigy  carried by four priests directed the trek away from the cave of origins by giving oracles  An oracle led to the foundation of Mexico Tenochtitlan  The Yucatec Mayas knew oracle priests or chilanes  literally  mouthpieces  of the deity  Their written repositories of traditional knowledge  the Books of Chilam Balam  were all ascribed to one famous oracle priest who correctly had predicted the coming of the Spaniards and its associated disasters   6 6  Sub Saharan Africa  The Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria in Africa have a long tradition of using oracles  In Igbo villages  oracles were usually female priestesses to a particular deity  usually dwelling in a cave or other secluded location away from urban areas  and  much as the oracles of ancient Greece  would deliver prophecies in an ecstatic state to visitors seeking advice  Two of their ancient oracles became especially famous during the pre colonial period  the Agbala oracle at Awka and the Chukwu oracle at Arochukwu  Though the vast majority of Igbos today are Christian  many of them still use oracles   Amongst the related Yoruba peoples of the same country  the Babalawos  and their female counterparts  the Iyanifas  serve collectively as the principal aspects of the tribe s World famous Ifa divination system  Due to this  they customarily officiate at a great many of its traditional and religious ceremonies   6 7  Norse mythology  In Norse mythology  Odin took the severed head of the mythical god Mimir to Asgard for consultation as an oracle  The Havamal and other sources relate the sacrifice of Odin for the oracular Runes whereby he lost an eye  external sight  and won wisdom  internal sight  insight   to be a consulted oracle  6 8  Hawaii  In Hawaii  oracles
