A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease  A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe  its toxins or one of its surface proteins  The agent stimulates the body s immune system to recognize the agent as foreign  destroy it  and keep a record of it  so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters   Vaccines can be prophylactic  example  to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or  wild  pathogen   or therapeutic  e g   vaccines against cancer are also being investigated  see cancer vaccine    The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae  smallpox of the cow   the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox  He used it in 1798 in the long title of his Inquiry into the   Variolae vaccinae   known    as    the Cow Pox  in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox  In 1881  to honour Jenner  Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed   1  Effectiveness  Vaccines have historically been the most effective means to fight and eradicate infectious diseases  Limitations to their effectiveness  nevertheless  exist  Sometimes  protection fails because the host s immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all  Lack of response commonly results from clinical factors such as diabetes  steroid use  HIV infection or age  However it also might fail for genetic reasons if the host s immune system includes no strains of B cells that can generate antibodies suited to reacting effectively and binding to the antigens associated with the pathogen   Even if the host does develop antibodies  protection might not be adequate  immunity might develop too slowly to be effective in time  the antibodies might not disable the pathogen completely  or there might be multiple strains of the pathogen  not all of which are equally susceptible to the immune reaction  However  even a partial  late  or weak immunity  such as a one resulting from cross immunity to a strain other than the target strain  may mitigate an infection  resulting in a lower mortality rate  lower morbidity and faster recovery   Adjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response  particularly for older people  50–75 years and up   whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened  The efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors   the disease itself  for some diseases vaccination performs better than for others   the strain of vaccine  some vaccines are specific to  or at least most effective against  particular strains of the disease   whether the vaccination schedule has been properly observed   idiosyncratic response to vaccination  some individuals are  non responders  to certain vaccines  meaning that they do not generate antibodies even after being vaccinated correctly   assorted factors such as ethnicity  age  or genetic predisposition  If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against  the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated victims   The following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program   careful modelling to anticipate the impact that an immunization campaign will have on the epidemiology of the disease in the medium to long term  ongoing surveillance for the relevant disease following introduction of a new vaccine  maintenance of high immunization rates  even when a disease has become rare  In 1958  there were 763 094 cases of measles in the United States  552 deaths resulted  After the introduction of new vaccines  the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year  median of 56   In early 2008  there were 64 suspected cases of measles  Fifty four of those infections were associated with importation from another country  although only 13% were actually acquired outside the United States  63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated   2  Adverse effects  Vaccination given during childhood are generally safe  Adverse effects if any are generally mild  The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question  Some potential side effects include  fever  pain around the injection site  and muscle aches  Severe side effects are extremely rare   3  Types  Vaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them   There are several types of vaccines in use  These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness  while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response   3 1  Inactivated  Some vaccines contain inactivated  but previously virulent  micro organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals  heat  radioactivity  or antibiotics  Examples are influenza  cholera  bubonic plague  polio  hepatitis A  and rabies   3 2  Attenuated  Some vaccines contain live  attenuated microorganisms  Many of these are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties  or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response  Although most attenuated vaccines are viral  some are bacterial in nature  Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever  measles  rubella  and mumps  and the bacterial disease typhoid  The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain  but contains a virulently modified strain called  BCG  used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine  The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization  Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages  They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults  But they may not be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals  and may rarely mutate to a virulent form and cause disease   3 3  Toxoid  Toxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro organism  Examples of toxoid based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria  Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy  Not all toxoids are for micro organisms  for example  Crotalus atrox toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites   3 4  Subunit  Protein subunit – rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro organism to an immune system  which would constitute a  whole agent  vaccine   a fragment of it can create an immune response  Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus  previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients  but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast   the virus like particle  VLP  vaccine against human papillomavirus  HPV  that is composed of the viral major capsid protein  and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus  Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization   3 5  Conjugate  Conjugate – certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic  By linking these outer coats to proteins  e g   toxins   the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen  This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine   3 6  Experimental  A number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use   Dendritic cell vaccines combine dendritic cells with antigens in order to present the antigens to the body s white blood cells  thus stimulating an immune reaction  These vaccines have shown some positive preliminary results for treating brain tumors   Recombinant Vector – by combining the physiology of one micro organism and the DNA of the other  immunity can be created against diseases that have complex infection processes  DNA vaccination – in recent years a new type of vaccine called DNA vaccination  created from an infectious agent s DNA  has been developed  It works by insertion  and expression  enhanced by the use of electroporation  triggering immune system recognition  of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells  Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them  Because these cells live for a very long time  if the pathogen that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time  they will be attacked instantly by the immune system  One advantage of DNA vaccines is that they are very easy to produce and store  As of 2006  DNA vaccination is still experimental   T cell receptor peptide vaccines are under development for several diseases using models of Valley Fever  stomatitis  and atopic dermatitis  These peptides have been shown to modulate cytokine production and improve cell mediated immunity   Targeting of identified bacterial proteins that are involved in complement inhibition would neutralize the key bacterial virulence mechanism  While most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro organisms  synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides  carbohydrates  or antigens   3 7  Valence  Vaccines may be monovalent  also called univalent  or multivalent  also called polyvalent   A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism  A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism  or against two or more microorganisms  The valency of a multivalent vaccine may be denoted with a Greek or Latin prefix  e g   tetravalent or quadrivalent   In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response   3 8  Heterotypic  Also known as Heterologous or  Jennerian  vaccines these are vaccines that are pathogens of other animals that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in the organism being treated  The classic example is Jenner s use of cowpox to protect against smallpox  A current example is the use of BCG vaccine made from Mycobacterium bovis to protect against human tuberculosis   4  Developing immunity  The immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign  destroys them  and  remembers  them  When the virulent version of an agent is encountered  the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus  and thus is prepared to respond  by  1  neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells  and  2  recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers   When two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation  the two vaccines can interfere  This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines  where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components  This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine  where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the  take  of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine  This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched  where the DEN 3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN 1  −2 and −4 serotypes   Vaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox  one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known to man  Other diseases such as rubella  polio  measles  mumps  chickenpox  and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago  As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated  it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur  let alone spread  This effect is called herd immunity  Polio  which is transmitted only between humans  is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries  Afghanistan  Nigeria  and Pakistan   The difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings  however  have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times   5  Schedule  In order to provide best protection  children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines  with additional  booster  shots often required to achieve  full immunity   This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules  In the United States  the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommends routine vaccination of children against  hepatitis A  hepatitis B  polio  mumps  measles  rubella  diphtheria  pertussis  tetanus  HiB  chickenpox  rotavirus  influenza  meningococcal disease and pneumonia  The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended  up to 24 injections by age two  has led to problems with achieving full compliance  In order to combat declining compliance rates  various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed  e g   Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine   which provide protection against multiple diseases   Besides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters  many specific vaccines are recommended at other ages or for repeated injections throughout life—most commonly for measles  tetanus  influenza  and pneumonia  Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella  The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U S   as of 2011  and UK  as of 2009   Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza  which are more deadly to that group  In 2006  a vaccine was introduced against shingles  a disease caused by the chickenpox virus  which usually affects the elderly   6  History  Prior to the introduction of vaccination with material from cases of cowpox  heterotypic immunisation   smallpox could be prevented by deliberate inoculation of smallpox virus  later referred to as variolation to distinguish it from smallpox vaccination  This information was brought to the West in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu  who showed it to Hans Sloane  the  British  King s physician   Sometime during the late 1760s whilst serving his apprenticeship as a surgeon apothecary Edward Jenner learned of the story  common in rural areas  that dairy workers would never have the often fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox  because they had already had cowpox  which has a very mild effect in humans  In 1796  Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox  scratched it into the arm of an 8 year old boy  and six weeks later inoculated  variolated  the boy with smallpox  afterwards observing that he did not catch smallpox  Jenner extended his studies and in 1798 reported that his vaccine was safe in children and adults and could be transferred from arm to arm reducing reliance on uncertain supplies from infected cows  Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation  the latter  though still widely practised in England  was banned in 1840  The second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax  and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige  and compulsory vaccination laws were passed   The twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines  including those against diphtheria  measles  mumps  and rubella  Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s  Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century  As vaccines became more common  many people began taking them for granted  However  vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases  including herpes simplex  malaria  and HIV   6 1  Landmarks in history of vaccines  7  Society and culture  7 1  Opposition to vaccination  Opposition to vaccination  from a wide array of vaccine critics  has existed since the earliest vaccination campaigns  Although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization  disputes have arisen over the morality  ethics  effectiveness  and safety of vaccination  Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate  Some religious groups do not allow vaccination  and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty  In response  concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life threatening infections  not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations  but also in those who cannot be vaccinated due to age or immunodeficiency  who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers  see herd immunity   Some parents believe vaccinations cause autism  although the scientific consensus has rejected this idea  In 2011  Andrew Wakefield  a leading proponent of one of the main controversies regarding a purported link between autism and vaccines  was found to have been financially motivated to falsify research data and was subsequently stripped of his medical license   7 2  Economics of development  One challenge in vaccine development is economic  Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine  including HIV  malaria and tuberculosis  exist principally in poor countries  Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases  because there is little revenue potential  Even in more affluent countries  financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great   Most vaccine development to date has relied on  push  funding by government  universities and non profit organizations  Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health  The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades  This increase  particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support  rather than economic incentive   7 3  Patents  The filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines  Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product  the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy   8  Production  Vaccine production has several stages  First  the antigen itself is generated  Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs  e g   for influenza  or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells  e g   for hepatitis A   Bacteria are grown in bioreactors  e g   Haemophilus influenzae type b   Likewise  a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast  bacteria  or cell cultures  After the antigen is generated  it is isolated from the cells used to generate it  A virus may need to be inactivated  possibly with no further purification required  Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography  Finally  the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant  stabilizers  and preservatives as needed  The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen  stabilizers increase the storage life  and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials  Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce  because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved   Vaccine production techniques are evolving  Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important  compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs  due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination  Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids  Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain  and thereby decrease undesirable interactions  by using pathogen associated molecular patterns   In 2010  India produced 60 percent of the world s vaccine worth about $900 million €670 million    8 1  Excipients  Beside the active vaccine itself  the following excipients are commonly present in vaccine preparations   Aluminum salts or gels are added as adjuvants  Adjuvants are added to promote an earlier  more potent response  and more persistent immune response to the vaccine  they allow for a lower vaccine dosage   Antibiotics are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during production and storage of the vaccine   Egg protein is present in influenza and yellow fever vaccines as they are prepared using chicken eggs  Other proteins may be present   Formaldehyde is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines  Formaldehyde is also used to inactivate unwanted viruses and kill bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production   Monosodium glutamate  MSG  and 2 phenoxyethanol are used as stabilizers in a few vaccines to help the vaccine remain unchanged when the vaccine is exposed to heat  light  acidity  or humidity   Thimerosal is a mercury containing preservative that is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria  Due to the controversy surrounding thimerosal it has been removed from most vaccines   8 2  Role of preservatives  Many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection  which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative  Several preservatives are available  including thiomersal  phenoxyethanol  and formaldehyde  Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria  has a better shelf life  and improves vaccine stability  potency  and safety  but  in the U S   the European Union  and a few other affluent countries  it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines  as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content  Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism  no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims   9  Delivery systems  The development of new delivery systems raises the hope of vaccines that are safer and more efficient to deliver and administer  Lines of research include liposomes and ISCOM  immune stimulating complex    Notable developments in vaccine delivery technologies have included oral vaccines  Early attempts to apply oral vaccines showed varying degrees of promise  beginning early in the 20th century  at a time when the very possibility of an effective oral antibacterial vaccine was controversial  By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an oral typhoid fever vaccine for example   An oral polio vaccine turned out to be effective when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training  the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines  Effective oral vaccines have many advantages  for example there is no risk of blood contamination  Vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid  and as solids they commonly are stabler and less prone to damage or to spoilage by freezing in transport and storage  Such stability reduces the need for a  cold chain   the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration  which  in turn  may decrease costs of vaccines   A microneedle approach  which is still in stages of development  uses  pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin    A nanopatch is a needle free vaccine delivery system that is under development  A stamp size patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20 000 microscopic projections per square inch  When worn on the skin  it will deliver vaccine directly to the skin  which has a higher concentration of immune cells than the muscle tissue does  which is one of the tissues where injections commonly deliver vaccines  Dermal administration by nanopatches thus increases the effectiveness of vaccination  while requiring less vaccine than injection   9 1  Plasmids  The use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases  However  in human studies this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit  The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid s immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells   10  Use in veterinary medicine  Vaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans  Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated  In some instances  wild populations may be vaccinated  This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine laced food spread in a disease prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons   Where rabies occurs  rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law  Other canine vaccines include canine distemper  canine parvovirus  infectious canine hepatitis  adenovirus 2  leptospirosis  bordatella  canine parainfluenza virus  and Lyme disease  among others   11  DIVA vaccines  DIVA  Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals  vaccines make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals   DIVA vaccines carry at least one epitope less than the microorganisms circulating in the field  An accompanying diagnostic test that detects antibody against that epitope allows us to actually make that differentiation   11 1  The first DIVA vaccines  The first DIVA vaccines  formerly termed marker vaccines and since 1999 coined as DIVA vaccines  and companion diagnostic tests have been developed by J T  van Oirschot and colleagues at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad  The Netherlands  They found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies  also termed Aujeszky’s disease  had deletions in their viral genome  among which the gE gene   Monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an ELISA that demonstrated antibodies against gE  In addition  novel genetically engineered gE negative vaccines were constructed  Along the same lines  DIVA vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus 1 infections have been developed   11 2  Use in practice  The DIVA strategy has been applied in various countries and successfully eradicated pseudorabies virus  Swine populations were intensively vaccinated and monitored by the companion diagnostic test and subsequently the infected pigs were removed from the population  Bovine herpesvirus 1 DIVA vaccines are also widely used in practice   11 3  Other DIVA vaccines  under development   Scientists have put and still are putting much effort in applying the DIVA principle to a wide range of infectious diseases  such as  for example  classical swine fever  avian influenza  Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia and Salmonella infections in pigs   12  Trends  Vaccine development has several trends   Until recently  most vaccines were aimed at infants and children  but adolescents and adults are increasingly being targeted   Combinations of vaccines are becoming more common  vaccines containing five or more components are used in many parts of the world  In 2013  Biofarma has released a new product called Pentabio  which is combination vaccine of Diphtheria  Tetanus  Pertussis  Hepatitis B  and Haemophilus Influenzae Type B for baby infant in Indonesia s Immunization Program   New methods of administering vaccines are being developed  such as skin patches  aerosols via inhalation devices  and eating genetically engineered plants   Vaccines are being designed to stimulate innate immune responses  as well as adaptive   Attempts are being made to develop vaccines to help cure chronic infections  as opposed to preventing disease   Vaccines are being developed to defend against bioterrorist attacks such as anthrax  plague  and smallpox   Appreciation for sex and pregnancy differences in vaccine responses  might change the strategies used by public health officials    Scientists are now trying to develop synthetic vaccines by reconstructing the outside structure of a virus  Principles that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases  such as cancers and autoimmune disorders  For example  the experimental vaccine CYT006 AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure  Factors that have impact on the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine  demographics  regulatory science  political  cultural  and social responses   12 1  Plants as bioreactors for vaccine production  Transgenic plants have been identified as promising expression systems for vaccine production  Complex plants such as tobacco  potato  tomato  and banana can have genes inserted that cause them to produce vaccines usable for humans  Bananas have been developed that produce a human vaccine against Hepatitis B  Another example is the expression of a fusion protein in alfalfa transgenic plants for the selective directioning to antigen presenting cells  therefore increasing vaccine potency against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus  BVDV    13  See also  Flying syringe  The Horse Named Jim  Immunization registry  Immunotherapy  List of vaccine
