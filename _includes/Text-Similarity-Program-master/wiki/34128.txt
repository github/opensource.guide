Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt  16 August 1832 – 31 August 1920  was a German physician  physiologist  philosopher  and professor  known today as one of the founding figures of modern psychology  Wundt  who noted psychology as a science apart from biology and philosophy  was the first person to ever call himself a Psychologist  He is widely regarded as the  father of experimental psychology   In 1879  Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research at the University of Leipzig  This marked psychology as an independent field of study   By creating this laboratory he was able to explore the nature of religious beliefs  identify mental disorders and abnormal behavior  and find damaged parts of the brain  In doing so  he was able to establish psychology as a separate science from other topics  He also formed the first journal for psychological research in the year 1881   1  Biography  Wundt was born at Neckarau  Baden  now part of Mannheim  on 16 August 1832  the fourth child to parents Maximilian Wundt  a Lutheran minister   and his wife Marie Frederike  née Arnold  1797 1868   Wundt s paternal grandfather was Friedrich Peter Wundt  1742 1805   Professor of Geography and pastor in Wieblingen  When Wundt was about four years of age  his family moved to Heidelsheim  then a small medieval town in Baden Württemberg   Wundt studied from 1851 to 1856 at the University of Tübingen  at the University of Heidelberg  and at the University of Berlin  After graduating in medicine from Heidelberg  1856   Wundt studied briefly with Johannes Peter Müller  before joining the University s staff  becoming an assistant to the physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1858  There he wrote Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception  1858–62   In 1865  he wrote a textbook about human physiology  However  his main interest was not in physiology but in the medical field of pathological anatomy  In 1867 he became a professor in acquainting medical students with the exact physical needs for medical investigation  In 1874  he became a professor of  Inductive Philosophy  in Zurich   In 1867  near Heidelberg  Wundt met Sophie Mau  1844 1912   She was the eldest daughter of the Kiel theology professor Heinrich August Mau and his wife Louise  née von Rumohr  and a sister of the archaeologist August Mau  They married on 14 August 1872 in Kiel  The couple had three children  Eleanor  *1876 1957    Lily  1880 1884   and Max Wundt  1879 1963   who became a philosopher   During Wundt s time at the University of Heidelberg he offered the first course ever taught in scientific psychology  all the while stressing the use of experimental methods drawn from the natural sciences  emphasizing the physiological relationship of the human brain and the mind  His background in physiology would have a great effect on his approach to the new science of psychology  His lectures on psychology were published as Lectures on the Mind of Humans and Animals in 1863 1864  He was promoted to Assistant Professor of Physiology at Heidelberg in 1864  Weber  1795–1878  and Fechner  1801–1887   who worked at Leipzig  inspired Wundt s interest in psychology   Wundt applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology  Principles of Physiological Psychology in 1874  This was the first textbook that was written pertaining to the field of psychology  Wundt claimed that the book was  an attempt to mark out  psychology  as a new domain of science   The Principles utilized a system of psychology that sought to investigate the immediate experiences of consciousness  including feelings  emotions  volitions and ideas  mainly explored through Wundt s system of  internal perception   or the self examination of conscious experience by objective observation of one s consciousness   In 1875  Wundt moved to Leipzig  In 1879  at the University of Leipzig  Wundt opened the first laboratory ever to be exclusively devoted to psychological studies  and this event marked the official birth of psychology as an independent field of study  The new lab was full of graduate students carrying out research on topics assigned by Wundt  and it soon attracted young scholars from all over the world who were eager to learn about the new science that Wundt had developed   2  Wundt s work and influence on modern psychology  Wundt believed that scientific psychology should focus on analyzing consciousness  a person s subjective experience of the world and mind  Parts of Wundt s system were developed and championed by his one time student  Titchener  who described his system as Structuralism  or the analysis of the basic elements that constitute the mind  This approach involved breaking consciousness down into elemental sensations and feelings  Wundt believed that scientific psychology should focus on consciousness and therefore centralizes on structuralism  Wundt analyzes the constituents of the mind by using a method called introspection  which involves the subjective observation of one s own experience  This became the reason why structuralism gradually faded out  based on the unreliability of this method  Several of Wundt s works  including Principles of Physiological Psychology  are considered fundamentally important texts in the fields of physiology and psychology  Though widely recognized as important in the birth and growth of psychology  his influence on psychology today is a subject of continuing debate among experts  Wundt also influenced in the field of psycholinguistics  For example  the influential Leonard Bloomfield based his linguistics textbook  published in 1914  on Wundtian psychology  Wundt hypothesized that the mental sentence  or  inner psychological construction   determines the unfolding sentence  and should therefore be regarded as a unit of speech   In 1886  in his  Logik   Wundt formulated the famous expression heterogony of ends  Heterogonie der Zwecke    Several of Wundt s students became eminent psychologists in their own right  including two who became philosophers  Ljubomir Nedić and Branislav Petronijević   They include  the Germans Oswald Külpe  a professor at the University of Würzburg   Ottmar Dittrich  who continued Wundt s work in psycholinguistics by heading the group on phonetics and psychology of language at the University of Leipzig   the Americans James McKeen Cattell  the first professor of psychology in the United States   G  Stanley Hall  the father of the child psychology movement and adolescent developmental theorist  head of Clark University   Charles Hubbard Judd  Director of the School of Education at the University of Chicago   Hugo Münsterberg  Walter Dill Scott  who contributed to the development of industrial psychology and taught at Harvard University   Edward Bradford Titchener  Lightner Witmer  founder of the first psychological clinic in his country   the Englishman Charles Spearman  who developed the two factor theory of intelligence and several important statistical analyses   see Factor analysis  Spearman s rank correlation coefficient   the Romanian Constantin Rădulescu Motru  Personalist philosopher and head of the Philosophy department at the University of Bucharest    The University of Leipzig assigned Wundt a lab in 1876 to store equipment he had brought from Zurich  Located in the Konvikt building  many of Wundt s demonstrations took place in this laboratory due to the inconvenience of transporting his equipment between the lab and his classroom  Wundt collected many pieces of equipment such as tachistoscopes  chronoscopes  pendulums  electrical devices  timers  and sensory mapping devices and was known to assign an instrument to various graduate students with the assignment of developing uses for future research in experimentation   In 1879 Wundt began conducting experiments that were not part of his course work  and he claimed that these independent experiments solidified his lab s legitimacy as a formal laboratory of psychology  though the University did not officially recognize the building as part of the campus until 1883  Wundt faced much opposition in regards to his fellow colleague s rejections of psychology as a legitimate science and their questions concerning the nature of introspection  Despite this opposition  the laboratory grew and encompassing a total of eleven rooms  the Psychological Institute  as it became known  eventually moved to a new building that Wundt had designed specifically for psychological research   Wundt s laboratory students called their approach Ganzheitspsychologie   holistic psychology   following Wundt s death  Much of Wundt s work was derided mid century in the United States because of a lack of adequate translations  misrepresentations by certain students  and behaviorism s polemic with the structuralist program  Titchener  a two year resident of Wundt s lab and one of Wundt s most vocal advocates in the United States  is responsible for several English translations and mistranslations of Wundt s works that supported his own views and approach  which he termed  structuralism  and claimed was wholly consistent with Wundt s position   Titchener s focus on internal structures of mind was rejected by behaviorists following the ideas of B  F  Skinner  the latter dominated psychological studies in the mid 1900s  Part of this rejection included Wundt  whose work was eclipsed during this period  In later decades  his actual positions and techniques have seen reconsideration and reassessment by major psychologists   An optical illusion described by him is called the Wundt illusion  Wundt tried to provide objective measurements of conscious processes by using reaction time techniques similar to those first developed by Helmholtz  His fasting research participants  focusing only on the response they were to make  could respond automatically to the tone because they didn t have to engage in the additional step of interpretation  This type of experimentation broke new ground by showing that psychologists could use scientific techniques to disentangle even subtle conscious processes   2   Like many of his contemporaries  Wundt accepted a developmental conception of mind  But developmental in the idealist sense of unfolding reason  such that the highest intelligence is a logical product of more primitive manifestations   3  Publications  Wundt was extremely prolific in publications  of which this is a selection only
