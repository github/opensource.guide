Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields  Electric currents and the fundamental magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field  which acts on other currents and magnetic moments  All materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field  The most familiar effect is on permanent magnets  which have persistent magnetic moments caused by ferromagnetism  Most materials do not have permanent moments  Some are attracted to a magnetic field  paramagnetism   others are repulsed by a magnetic field  diamagnetism   others have a much more complex relationship with an applied magnetic field  spin glass behavior and antiferromagnetism   Substances that are negligibly affected by magnetic fields are known as non magnetic substances  They include copper  aluminium  gases  and plastic  Pure oxygen exhibits magnetic properties when cooled to a liquid state   The magnetic state  or phase  of a material depends on temperature  and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field  so that a material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism depending on its temperature  etc   1  History  Aristotle attributed the first of what could be called a scientific discussion on magnetism to Thales of Miletus  who lived from about 625 BC to about 545 BC  Around the same time  in ancient India  the Indian surgeon  Sushruta  was the first to make use of the magnet for surgical purposes   In ancient China  the earliest literary reference to magnetism lies in a 4th century BC book named after its author  The Master of Demon Valley  鬼谷子    The lodestone makes iron come or it attracts it   The earliest mention of the attraction of a needle appears in a work composed between AD 20 and 100  Louen heng    A lodestone attracts a needle   The Chinese scientist Shen Kuo  1031–1095  was the first person to write of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the astronomical concept of true north  Dream Pool Essays  AD 1088   and by the 12th century the Chinese were known to use the lodestone compass for navigation  They sculpted a directional spoon from lodestone in such a way that the handle of the spoon always pointed south   Alexander Neckam  by 1187  was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation  In 1269  Peter Peregrinus de Maricourt wrote the Epistola de magnete  the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets  In 1282  the properties of magnets and the dry compass were discussed by Al Ashraf  a Yemeni physicist  astronomer  and geographer   In 1600  William Gilbert published his De Magnete  Magneticisque Corporibus  et de Magno Magnete Tellure  On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies  and on the Great Magnet the Earth   In this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the terrella  From his experiments  he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north  previously  some believed that it was the pole star  Polaris  or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass    An understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by Hans Christian Ørsted  a professor at the University of Copenhagen  who discovered more or less by accident that an electric current could influence a compass needle  This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted s Experiment  Several other experiments followed  with André Marie Ampère  who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path  Carl Friedrich Gauss  Jean Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart  both of whom in 1820 came up with the Biot–Savart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current carrying wire  Michael Faraday  who in 1831 found that a time varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage  and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity  James Clerk Maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into Maxwell s equations  unifying electricity  magnetism  and optics into the field of electromagnetism  In 1905  Einstein used these laws in motivating his theory of special relativity  requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames   Electromagnetism has continued to develop into the 21st century  being incorporated into the more fundamental theories of gauge theory  quantum electrodynamics  electroweak theory  and finally the standard model   2  Sources of magnetism  Magnetism  at its root  arises from two sources   Electric current  see electron magnetic dipole moment    Nuclear magnetic moments of atomic nuclei  These moments are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons  magnetic moments  so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials  Nuclear magnetic moments are very important in other contexts  particularly in nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  and magnetic resonance imaging  MRI   Ordinarily  the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments  both orbital and intrinsic  cancel out  This is due  to some extent  to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the Pauli exclusion principle  see electron configuration   or combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital motion  In both cases  the electron arrangement is so as to exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each electron  Moreover  even when the electron configuration is such that there are unpaired electrons and or non filled subshells  it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different  random directions  so that the material will not be magnetic   However  sometimes—either spontaneously  or owing to an applied external magnetic field—each of the electron magnetic moments will be  on average  lined up  Then the material can produce a net total magnetic field  which can potentially be quite strong   The magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure  particularly its electron configuration  for the reasons mentioned above  and also on the temperature  At high temperatures  random thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment   3  Topics  3 1  Diamagnetism  Diamagnetism appears in all materials  and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field  and therefore  to be repelled by a magnetic field  However  in a material with paramagnetic properties  that is  with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field   the paramagnetic behavior dominates  Thus  despite its universal occurrence  diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material  In a diamagnetic material  there are no unpaired electrons  so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect  In these cases  the magnetization arises from the electrons  orbital motions  which can be understood classically as follows   Note that this description is meant only as an heuristic  a proper understanding requires a quantum mechanical description   Note that all materials undergo this orbital response  However  in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances  the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons   3 2  Paramagnetism  In a paramagnetic material there are unpaired electrons  i e  atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them  While paired electrons are required by the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic   spin   magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions  causing their magnetic fields to cancel out  an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction  When an external magnetic field is applied  these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field  thus reinforcing it   3 3  Ferromagnetism  A ferromagnet  like a paramagnetic substance  has unpaired electrons  However  in addition to the electrons  intrinsic magnetic moment s tendency to be parallel to an applied field  there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered energy state  Thus  even in the absence of an applied field  the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another   Every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature  called the Curie temperature  or Curie point  above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties  This is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy lowering due to ferromagnetic order   Ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances  the common ones are iron  nickel  cobalt  their alloys  and some alloys of rare earth metals   3 3 1  Magnetic domains  The magnetic moment of atoms in a ferromagnetic material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets  They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains  Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch  There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields   When a domain contains too many molecules  it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably as shown at the right   When exposed to a magnetic field  the domain boundaries move so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure  dotted yellow area  as shown at the left  When the magnetizing field is removed  the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state  This results in the ferromagnetic material s being magnetized  forming a permanent magnet   When magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain  the material is magnetically saturated  When a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the Curie point temperature  the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause cease  When the material is cooled  this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns  in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can freeze into a crystalline solid   3 4  Antiferromagnetism  In an antiferromagnet  unlike a ferromagnet  there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in opposite directions  When all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is  anti aligned   the substance is antiferromagnetic  Antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment  meaning no field is produced by them  Antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors  and are mostly observed at low temperatures  In varying temperatures  antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties   In some materials  neighboring electrons want to point in opposite directions  but there is no geometrical arrangement in which each pair of neighbors is anti aligned  This is called a spin glass  and is an example of geometrical frustration   3 5  Ferrimagnetism  Like ferromagnetism  ferrimagnets retain their magnetization in the absence of a field  However  like antiferromagnets  neighboring pairs of electron spins like to point in opposite directions  These two properties are not contradictory  because in the optimal geometrical arrangement  there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction  than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction   Most ferrites are ferrimagnetic  The first discovered magnetic substance  magnetite  is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet  Louis Néel disproved this  however  after discovering ferrimagnetism   3 6  Superparamagnetism  When a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small  it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to Brownian motion  Its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet  but much larger   3 7  Electromagnet  An electromagnet is a type of magnet whose magnetism is produced by the flow of electric current  The magnetic field disappears when the current ceases   3 8  Other types of magnetism  Molecular magnet  Metamagnetism  Molecule based magnet  Spin glass  4  Magnetism  electricity  and special relativity  As a consequence of Einstein s theory of special relativity  electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked  Both magnetism lacking electricity  and electricity without magnetism  are inconsistent with special relativity  due to such effects as length contraction  time dilation  and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity dependent  However  when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account  the resulting theory  electromagnetism  is fully consistent with special relativity  In particular  a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another  or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference  Thus  special relativity  mixes  electricity and magnetism into a single  inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism  analogous to how relativity  mixes  space and time into spacetime   All observations on electromagnetism apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism  e g  perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field  and propagate at the speed of light   5  Magnetic fields in a material  In a vacuum   where is the vacuum permeability   In a material   The quantity is called magnetic polarization   If the field is small  the response of the magnetization in a diamagnet or paramagnet is approximately linear   the constant of proportionality being called the magnetic susceptibility  If so   In a hard magnet such as a ferromagnet  is not proportional to the field and is generally nonzero even when is zero  see Remanence    6  Magnetic force  The phenomenon of magnetism is  mediated  by the magnetic field  An electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field  and that field  in turn  imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields   Maxwell s equations  which simplify to the Biot–Savart law in the case of steady currents  describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces  Therefore magnetism is seen whenever electrically charged particles are in motion—for example  from movement of electrons in an electric current  or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom s nucleus  They also arise from  intrinsic  magnetic dipoles arising from quantum mechanical spin   The same situations that create magnetic fields—charge moving in a current or in an atom  and intrinsic magnetic dipoles—are also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect  creating a force  Following is the formula for moving charge  for the forces on an intrinsic dipole  see magnetic dipole   When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field B  it feels a Lorentz force F given by the cross product   where  Because this is a cross product  the force is perpendicular to both the motion of the particle and the magnetic field  It follows that the magnetic force does no work on the particle  it may change the direction of the particle s movement  but it cannot cause it to speed up or slow down  The magnitude of the force is  where is the angle between v and B   One tool for determining the direction of the velocity vector of a moving charge  the magnetic field  and the force exerted is labeling the index finger  V   the middle finger  B   and the thumb  F  with your right hand  When making a gun like configuration  with the middle finger crossing under the index finger  the fingers represent the velocity vector  magnetic field vector  and force vector  respectively  See also right hand rule   7  Magnetic dipoles  A very common source of magnetic field shown in nature is a dipole  with a  South pole  and a  North pole   terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses  interacting with the Earth s magnetic field to indicate North and South on the globe  Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted  the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet  The Earth s North Magnetic Pole  currently in the Arctic Ocean  north of Canada  is physically a south pole  as it attracts the north pole of a compass  A magnetic field contains energy  and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy  When diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field  a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field  thereby lowering the net field strength  When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field  the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field  thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains   7 1  Magnetic monopoles  Since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar  when a bar magnet is cut in half  each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet  Even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole  these two poles cannot be separated from each other  A monopole—if such a thing exists—would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object  It would act as an isolated north pole  not attached to a south pole  or vice versa  Monopoles would carry  magnetic charge  analogous to electric charge  Despite systematic searches since 1931    they have never been observed  and could very well not exist   Nevertheless  some theoretical physics models predict the existence of these magnetic monopoles  Paul Dirac observed in 1931 that  because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry  just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge  isolated South or North magnetic poles should be observable  Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist  then one could explain the quantization of electric charge—that is  why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron   Certain grand unified theories predict the existence of monopoles which  unlike elementary particles  are solitons  localized energy packets   The initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the big bang contradicted cosmological observations—the monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe  However  the idea of inflation  for which this problem served as a partial motivation  was successful in solving this problem  creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations   8  Quantum mechanical origin of magnetism  In principle all kinds of magnetism originate  similar to superconductivity  from specific quantum mechanical phenomena  e g  Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics  in particular the chapters on spin and on the Pauli principle   A successful model was developed already in 1927  by Walter Heitler and Fritz London  who derived quantum mechanically  how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen atoms  i e  from the atomic hydrogen orbitals and centered at the nuclei A and B  see below  That this leads to magnetism is not at all obvious  but will be explained in the following   According to the Heitler London theory  so called two body molecular  orbitals are formed  namely the resulting orbital is   Here the last product means that a first electron  r1  is in an atomic hydrogen orbital centered at the second nucleus  whereas the second electron runs around the first nucleus  This  exchange  phenomenon is an expression for the quantum mechanical property that particles with identical properties cannot be distinguished  It is specific not only for the formation of chemical bonds  but as we will see  also for magnetism  i e  in this connection the term exchange interaction arises  a term which is essential for the origin of magnetism  and which is stronger  roughly by factors 100 and even by 1000  than the energies arising from the electrodynamic dipole dipole interaction   As for the spin function   which is responsible for the magnetism  we have the already mentioned Pauli s principle  namely that a symmetric orbital  i e  with the + sign as above  must be multiplied with an antisymmetric spin function  i e  with a − sign   and vice versa  Thus   I e   not only and must be substituted by α and β  respectively  the first entity means  spin up   the second one  spin down    but also the sign + by the − sign  and finally ri by the discrete values si    ±½   thereby we have and   The  singlet state   i e  the − sign  means  the spins are antiparallel  i e  for the solid we have antiferromagnetism  and for two atomic molecules one has diamagnetism  The tendency to form a  homoeopolar  chemical bond  this means  the formation of a symmetric molecular orbital  i e  with the + sign  results through the Pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state  i e  with the − sign   In contrast  the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons  i e  the tendency that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion  would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function  i e  with the − sign  of these two particles  and complementary to a symmetric spin function  i e  with the + sign  one of the so called  triplet functions    Thus  now the spins would be parallel  ferromagnetism in a solid  paramagnetism in two atomic gases    The last mentioned tendency dominates in the metals iron  cobalt and nickel  and in some rare earths  which are ferromagnetic  Most of the other metals  where the first mentioned tendency dominates  are nonmagnetic  e g  sodium  aluminium  and magnesium  or antiferromagnetic  e g  manganese   Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic  and not paramagnetic  However  the oxygen molecule  because of the involvement of π orbitals  is an exception important for the life sciences   The Heitler London considerations can be generalized to the Heisenberg model of magnetism  Heisenberg 1928    The explanation of the phenomena is thus essentially based on all subtleties of quantum mechanics  whereas the electrodynamics covers mainly the phenomenology   9  Units of electromagnetism  9 1  SI units related to magnetism  9 2  Other units  gauss – The gauss is the centimeter gram second  CGS  unit of
