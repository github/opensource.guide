A road is a thoroughfare  route  or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by some conveyance  including a horse  cart  or motor vehicle   Roads consist of one or two roadways  British English  carriageways   each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks  British English  pavement  and road verges   Roads that are available for use by the public may be referred to as public roads or as highways   1  Definitions  The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  defines a road as  a line of communication  travelled way  using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips open to public traffic  primarily for the use of road motor vehicles running on their own wheels   which includes  bridges  tunnels  supporting structures  junctions  crossings  interchanges  and toll roads  but not cycle paths    In urban areas roads may diverge through a city or village and be named as streets  serving a dual function as urban space easement and route  Modern roads are normally smoothed  paved  or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel  Historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance   1 1  United States  In the United States  laws distinguish between public roads  which are open to public use  and private roads  which are privately controlled   1 2  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom there is some ambiguity between the terms highway and road  The Highway code details rules for  road users   For the purposes of the English law  Highways Act 1980  which covers England and Wales but not Scotland or Northern Ireland  the term road is defined to be  any length of highway or of any other road to which the public has access  and includes bridges over which a road passes   This includes footpaths  bridleways and cycle tracks  and also road and driveways on private land and many car parks  Vehicle Excise Duty  a road use tax  is payable on some vehicles used on the public road   The definition of a road depends on the definition of a highway  however there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant Act  A 1984 ruling said  the land over which a public right of way exists is known as a highway  and although most highways have been made up into roads  and most easements of way exist over footpaths  the presence or absence of a made road has nothing to do with the distinction  Another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths  bridleways  driftways  etc   it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor vehicles  and the term rights of way can be used to cover the wider usage   2  History  The assertion that the first pathways were the trails made by animals has not been universally accepted  in many cases animals do not follow constant paths  Others believe that some roads originated from following animal trails  The Icknield Way is given as an example of this type of road origination  where man and animal both selected the same natural line  By about 10 000 BC  rough roads pathways were used by human travelers   The world s oldest known paved road was laid in Egypt some time between 2600 and 2200 BC   Stone paved streets are found in the city of Ur in the Middle East dating back to 4000 BC   Corduroy roads  log roads  are found dating to 4000 BC in Glastonbury  England   The Sweet Track  a timber track causeway in England  is one of the oldest engineered roads discovered and the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe  Built in winter 3807 BC or spring 3806 BC  tree ring dating  Dendrochronology  enabled very precise dating  It was claimed to be the oldest road in the world until the 2009 discovery of a 6 000 year old trackway in Plumstead  London   Brick paved streets were used in India as early as 3000 BC    In 500 BC  Darius I the Great started an extensive road system for Persia  Iran   including the Royal Road  which was one of the finest highways of its time  The road remained in use after Roman times   In ancient times  transport by river was far easier and faster than transport by road  especially considering the cost of road construction and the difference in carrying capacity between carts and river barges  A hybrid of road transport and ship transport beginning in about 1740 is the horse drawn boat in which the horse follows a cleared path along the river bank   From about 312 BC  the Roman Empire built straight strong stone Roman roads throughout Europe and North Africa  in support of its military campaigns  At its peak the Roman Empire was connected by 29 major roads moving out from Rome and covering 78 000 kilometers or 52 964 Roman miles of paved roads   In the 8th century AD  many roads were built throughout the Arab Empire  The most sophisticated roads were those in Baghdad  which were paved with tar  Tar was derived from petroleum  accessed from oil fields in the region  through the chemical process of destructive distillation   The Highways Act 1555 in Britain transferred responsibility for maintaining roads from government to local parishes  This resulted in a poor and variable state of roads  To remedy this  the first of the  Turnpike trusts  was established around 1706  to build good roads and collect tolls from passing vehicles  Eventually there were approximately 1 100 trusts in Britain and some 36 800 km  22 870 miles  of engineered roads  The Rebecca Riots in Carmarthenshire and Rhayader from 1839 to 1844 contributed to a Royal Commission that led to the demise of the system in 1844  which coincided with the development of the UK railway system   3  Design  The subject of road design is considered part of highway engineering  Structural road design is the science of designing a road for its environment in order to extend its longevity and reduce maintenance  The Shell pavement design method is used in many countries for the design of new asphalt roads   4  Construction  Road construction requires the creation of a continuous right of way  overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle or foot travel   pg15  and may be required to meet standards set by law or official guidelines  The process is often begun with the removal of earth and rock by digging or blasting  construction of embankments  bridges and tunnels  and removal of vegetation  this may involve deforestation  and followed by the laying of pavement material  A variety of road building equipment is employed in road building   After design  approval  planning  legal and environmental considerations have been addressed alignment of the road is set out by a surveyor  The radii and gradient are designed and staked out to best suit the natural ground levels and minimize the amount of cut and fill   page34  Great care is taken to preserve reference Benchmarks  page59   Roads are designed and built for primary use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic  Storm drainage and environmental considerations are a major concern  Erosion and sediment controls are constructed to prevent detrimental effects  Drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with runoff coefficients and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system  Drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse  creek  river or the sea for drainage discharge   page38 to 40   A borrow pit  source for obtaining fill  gravel  and rock  and a water source should be located near or in reasonable distance to the road construction site  Approval from local authorities may be required to draw water or for working  crushing and screening  of materials for construction needs  The top soil and vegetation is removed from the borrow pit and stockpiled for subsequent rehabilitation of the extraction area  Side slopes in the excavation area not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal for safety reasons   page 53 to 56    Old road surfaces  fences  and buildings may need to be removed before construction can begin  Trees in the road construction area may be marked for retention  These protected trees should not have the topsoil within the area of the tree s drip line removed and the area should be kept clear of construction material and equipment  Compensation or replacement may be required if a protected tree is damaged  Much of the vegetation may be mulched and put aside for use during reinstatement  The topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road  Stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins  Final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding  planting  watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas   page 66 to 67    Processes during earthwork include excavation  removal of material to spoil  filling  compacting  construction and trimming  If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed  moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements  generally 90 95% relative compaction   Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the road bed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base  When a depression must be filled to come up to the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed  The fill is made by the  compacted layer method  where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications  under saturated conditions  The process is repeated until the desired grade is reached   page 68 to 69     General fill material should be free of organics  meet minimum California bearing ratio  CBR  results and have a low plasticity index  The lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand rich mixture with fine gravel  which acts as an inhibitor to the growth of plants or other vegetable matter  The compacted fill also serves as lower stratum drainage  Select second fill  sieved  should be composed of gravel  decomposed rock or broken rock below a specified particle size and be free of large lumps of clay  Sand clay fill may also be used  The road bed must be  proof rolled  after each layer of fill is compacted  If a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply   page 70 to 72    Geosynthetics such as geotextiles  geogrids and geocells are frequently used in the various pavement layers to improve road quality  Geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads  separation  reinforcement  filtration and drainage  which increase the pavement performance  reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance   The completed road way is finished by paving or left with a gravel or other natural surface  The type of road surface is dependent on economic factors and expected usage  Safety improvements such as traffic signs  crash barriers  raised pavement markers and other forms of road surface marking are installed   According to a May 2009 report by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  AASHTO  and TRIP—a national transportation research organization—driving on rough roads costs the average American motorist approximately $400 a year in extra vehicle operating costs  Drivers living in urban areas with populations more than 250 000 are paying upwards of $750 more annually because of accelerated vehicle deterioration  increased maintenance  additional fuel consumption  and tire wear caused by poor road conditions   When a single carriageway road is converted into dual carriageway by building a second separate carriageway alongside the first  it is usually referred to as duplication  twinning or doubling  The original carriageway is changed from two way to become one way  while the new carriageway is one way in the opposite direction  In the same way as converting railway lines from single track to double track  the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway   5  Maintenance  Like all structures  roads deteriorate over time  Deterioration is primarily due to accumulated damage from vehicles  however environmental effects such as frost heaves  thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute  According to a series of experiments carried out in the late 1950s  called the AASHO Road Test  it was empirically determined that the effective damage done to the road is roughly proportional to the Fourth power of axle weight  A typical tractor trailer weighing 80 000 pounds  36 287 t  with 8 000 pounds  3 629 t  on the steer axle and 36 000 pounds  16 329 t  on both of the tandem axle groups is expected to do 7 800 times more damage than a passenger vehicle with 2 000 pounds  0 907 t  on each axle  Potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction works   Pavements are designed for an expected service life or design life  In some parts of the United Kingdom the standard design life is 40 years for new bitumen and concrete pavement  Maintenance is considered in the whole life cost of the road with service at 10  20 and 30 year milestones  Roads can be and are designed for a variety of lives  8   15   30   and 60 year designs   When pavement lasts longer than its intended life  it may have been overbuilt  and the original costs may have been too high  When a pavement fails before its intended design life  the owner may have excessive repair and rehabilitation costs  Some asphalt pavements are designed as perpetual pavements with an expected structural life in excess of 50 years   Many asphalt pavements built over 35 years ago  despite not being specifically designed as a perpetual pavement  have remained in good condition long past their design life  Many concrete pavements built since the 1950s have significantly outlived their intended design lives  Some roads like Chicago  Illinois s  Wacker Drive   a major two level viaduct in downtown area are being rebuilt with a designed service life of 100 years   Virtually all roads require some form of maintenance before they come to the end of their service life  Pro active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads  Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser inertial Profilometers  These measurements include road curvature  cross slope  asperity  roughness  rutting and texture  This data is fed into a pavement management system  which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred   Maintenance treatments for asphalt concrete generally include thin asphalt overlays  crack sealing  surface rejuvenating  fog sealing  micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments  Thin surfacing preserves  protects and improves the functional condition of the road while reducing the need for routing maintenance  leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity   Maintenance for the older concrete pavements that develop faults includes the technique called dowel bar retrofit  This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint  placing dowel bars in the slots  then filling them with concrete patching material  This method can extend the life of the concrete pavement for another 15 years   Failure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society  in a 2009 report released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  USA  about 50% of the roads in the USA are in bad condition with urban areas worse  The report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746 year on vehicle repairs while the average US motorist pays about $335 year  In contrast  the average motorist pays about $171 year in road maintenance taxes  based on 600 gallons year and $0 285 gallon tax    5 1  Slab stabilization  Distress and serviceability loss on concrete roads can be caused by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs  The voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration  The most common causes of voids are pumping  consolidation  subgrade failure and bridge approach failure  Slab stabilization is a non destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other Concrete Pavement Restoration  CPR  methods including patching and diamond grinding  The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints  cracks or the pavement edge   The process consists of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab  The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and or sub base  The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete  The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes  grout injection and post testing the stabilized slabs   Slab stabilization does not correct depressions  increase the design structural capacity  stop erosion or eliminate faulting  It does  however  restore the slab support  therefore  decreasing deflections under the load  Stabilization should only be performed at joints and cracks where loss of support exists  Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids  Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting  corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks  Deflection testing is another common procedure utilized to locate voids  It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures  joints open  aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest   5 2  Testing  Ground penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into the pavement and measures and graphically displays the reflected signal  This can reveal voids and other defects   The epoxy core test  detects voids by visual and mechanical methods  It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter hole through the pavement into the sub base with a dry bit roto hammer  Next  a two part epoxy is poured into the hole舒dyed for visual clarity  Once the epoxy hardens  technicians drill through the hole  If a void is present  the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence   Common stabilization materials include pozzolan cement grout and polyurethane  The requirements for slab stabilization are strength and the ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids  Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan cement grouts  The contractor must place the grout using a positive displacement injection pump or a non pulsing progressive cavity pump  A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or breakouts  The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole  The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast control reverse switch  in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge  The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges   5 3  Joint sealing  Also called joint and crack repair  this method’s purpose is to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system  Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration  CPR  techniques  Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal  shaping and cleaning the reservoir  installing the backer rod and installing the sealant  Sawing  manual removal  plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant  Saws are used to shape the reservoir  When cleaning the reservoir  no dust  dirt or traces of old sealant should remain  Thus  it is recommended to water wash  sand blast and then air blow to remove any sand  dirt or dust  The backer rod installation requires a double wheeled  steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth  After inserting the backer rod  the sealant is placed into the joint  There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid  silicone and preformed compression seals   6  Safety considerations  Careful design and construction of roads can increase road traffic safety and reduce the harm  deaths  injuries  and property damage  on the highway system from traffic collisions   On neighborhood roads traffic calming  safety barriers  pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes can all protect pedestrians and cyclists   Lane markers in some countries and states are marked with Cat s eyes or Botts dots  bright reflectors that do not fade like paint  Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter  because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road  although they can be embedded in short  shallow trenches carved in the roadway  as is done in the mountainous regions of California   For major roads risk can be reduced by providing limited access from properties and local roads  grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite direction traffic to reduce likelihood of head on collisions   The placement of energy attenuation devices  e g  guardrails  wide grassy areas  sand barrels  is also common  Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact  Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them  Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road   7  Environmental performance  Careful design and construction of a road can reduce any negative environmental impacts   Water management systems can be used to reduce the effect of pollutants from roads  Rainwater and snowmelt running off of roads tends to pick up gasoline  motor oil  heavy metals  trash and other pollutants and result in Water pollution  Road runoff is a major source of nickel  copper  zinc  cadmium  lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs   which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels   De icing chemicals and sand can run off into roadsides  contaminate groundwater and pollute surface waters  and road salts can be toxic to sensitive plants and animals  Sand applied to icy roads can be ground up by traffic into fine particulates and contribute to air pollution  Sand can alter stream bed environments  causing stress for the plants and animals that live there   Roads are a chief source of environmental noise generation  In the early 1970s it was recognized that design of roads can be conducted to influence and minimize noise generation  Noise barriers are used to reduce noise pollution  in particular where roads are located close to built up areas  Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking   Motor vehicle emissions contribute air pollution  Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road  Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions  In addition  on road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change  scientists say   8  Terminology  Alignment — the route of

countries where traffic flows on the right  traffic signs are mostly on the right side of the road  roundabouts and traffic circles go counter clockwise anti clockwise  and pedestrians crossing a two way road should watch out for traffic from the left first  In countries where traffic flows on the left  the reverse is true   About 33% of the world by population drive on the left  and 67% keep right  By road distances  about 28% drive on the left  and 72% on the right  even though originally most traffic drove on the left worldwide   10  Economics  Transport economics is used to understand both the relationship between the transport system and the wider economy and the complex network effects when there are multiple paths and competing modes for both personal and freight  road rail air ferry  and where Induced demand can result in increased on decreased transport levels when road provision is increased by building new roads or decreased  for example California State Route 480   Roads are generally built and maintained by the public sector using taxation although implementation may be through private contractors   or occasionally using road tolls   Public private partnerships are a way for communities to address the rising cost by injecting private funds into the infrastructure  There are four main ones   design build  design build operate maintain  design build finance operate  build own operate Economics and society depend heavily on efficient roads  In the European Union  EU  44% of all goods are moved by trucks over roads and 85% of all people are transported by cars  buses or coaches on roads  The term was also commonly used to refer to roadsteads  waterways that lent themselves to use by shipping   10 1  Construction costs  According to the New York State
