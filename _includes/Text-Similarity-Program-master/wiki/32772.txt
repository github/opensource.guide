Virology is the study of viruses – submicroscopic  parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat – and virus like agents  It focuses on the following aspects of viruses  their structure  classification and evolution  their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction  their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity  the diseases they cause  the techniques to isolate and culture them  and their use in research and therapy  Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine   1  Virus structure and classification  A major branch of virology is virus classification  Viruses can be classified according to the host cell they infect  animal viruses  plant viruses  fungal viruses  and bacteriophages  viruses infecting bacteria  which include the most complex viruses   Another classification uses the geometrical shape of their capsid  often a helix or an icosahedron  or the virus s structure  e g  presence or absence of a lipid envelope   Viruses range in size from about 30 nm to about 450 nm  which means that most of them cannot be seen with light microscopes  The shape and structure of viruses has been studied by electron microscopy  NMR spectroscopy  and X ray crystallography   The most useful and most widely used classification system distinguishes viruses according to the type of nucleic acid they use as genetic material and the viral replication method they employ to coax host cells into producing more viruses   DNA viruses  divided into double stranded DNA viruses and single stranded DNA viruses    RNA viruses  divided into positive sense single stranded RNA viruses  negative sense single stranded RNA viruses and the much less common double stranded RNA viruses    reverse transcribing viruses  double stranded reverse transcribing DNA viruses and single stranded reverse transcribing RNA viruses including retroviruses   The latest report by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses  2005  lists 5450 viruses  organized in over 2 000 species  287 genera  73 families and 3 orders   Virologists also study subviral particles  infectious entities notably smaller and simpler than viruses   viroids  naked circular RNA molecules infecting plants    satellites  nucleic acid molecules with or without a capsid that require a helper virus for infection and reproduction   and  prions  proteins that can exist in a pathological conformation that induces other prion molecules to assume that same conformation   Taxa in virology are not necessarily monophyletic  as the evolutionary relationships of the various virus groups remain unclear  Three hypotheses regarding their origin exist   Viruses arose from non living matter  separately from yet in parallel to cells  perhaps in the form of self replicating RNA ribozymes similar to viroids   Viruses arose by genome reduction from earlier  more competent cellular life forms that became parasites to host cells and subsequently lost most of their functionality  examples of such tiny parasitic prokaryotes are Mycoplasma and Nanoarchaea   Viruses arose from mobile genetic elements of cells  such as transposons  retrotransposons or plasmids  that became encapsulated in protein capsids  acquired the ability to  break free  from the host cell and infect other cells  Of particular interest here is mimivirus  a giant virus that infects amoebae and encodes much of the molecular machinery traditionally associated with bacteria  Is it a simplified version of a parasitic prokaryote  or did it originate as a simpler virus that acquired genes from its host   The evolution of viruses  which often occurs in concert with the evolution of their hosts  is studied in the field of viral evolution   While viruses reproduce and evolve  they do not engage in metabolism  do not move  and depend on a host cell for reproduction  The often debated question of whether they are alive or not is a matter of definition that does not affect the biological reality of viruses   2  Viral diseases and host defenses  One main motivation for the study of viruses is the fact that they cause many important infectious diseases  among them the common cold  influenza  rabies  measles  many forms of diarrhea  hepatitis  Dengue fever  yellow fever  polio  smallpox and AIDS  Herpes simplex causes cold sores and genital herpes and is under investigation as a possible factor in Alzheimer s   Some viruses  known as oncoviruses  contribute to the development of certain forms of cancer  The best studied example is the association between Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer  almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by certain strains of this sexually transmitted virus  Another example is the association of infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses and liver cancer   Some subviral particles also cause disease  the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  which include Kuru  Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy   mad cow disease    are caused by prions  hepatitis D is due to a satellite virus   The study of the manner in which viruses cause disease is viral pathogenesis  The degree to which a virus causes disease is its virulence   When the immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus  it may produce specific antibodies which bind to the virus and neutralize its infectivity or mark it for destruction  Antibody presence in blood serum is often used to determine whether a person has been exposed to a given virus in the past  with tests such as ELISA  Vaccinations protect against viral diseases  in part  by eliciting the production of antibodies  Monoclonal antibodies  specific to the virus  are also used for detection  as in fluorescence microscopy   A second defense of vertebrates against viruses  cell mediated immunity  involves immune cells known as T cells  the body s cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell s surface  and if a T cell recognizes a suspicious viral fragment there  the host cell is destroyed and the virus specific T cells proliferate  This mechanism is jump started by certain vaccinations   RNA interference  an important cellular mechanism found in plants  animals and many other eukaryotes  most likely evolved as a defense against viruses  An elaborate machinery of interacting enzymes detects double stranded RNA molecules  which occur as part of the life cycle of many viruses  and then proceeds to destroy all single stranded versions of those detected RNA molecules   Every lethal viral disease presents a paradox  killing its host is obviously of no benefit to the virus  so how and why did it evolve to do so  Today it is believed that most viruses are relatively benign in their natural hosts  some viral infection might even be beneficial to the host  The lethal viral diseases are believed to have resulted from an  accidental  jump of the virus from a species in which it is benign to a new one that is not accustomed to it  see zoonosis   For example  viruses that cause serious influenza in humans probably have pigs or birds as their natural host  and HIV is thought to derive from the benign non human primate virus SIV   While it has been possible to prevent  certain  viral diseases by vaccination for a long time  the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a comparatively recent development  The first such drug was interferon  a substance that is naturally produced when an infection is detected and stimulates other parts of the immune system   3  Molecular biology research and viral therapy  Bacteriophages  the viruses which infect bacteria  can be relatively easily grown as viral plaques on bacterial cultures  Bacteriophages occasionally move genetic material from one bacterial cell to another in a process known as transduction  and this horizontal gene transfer is one reason why they served as a major research tool in the early development of molecular biology  The genetic code  the function of ribozymes  the first recombinant DNA and early genetic libraries were all arrived at using bacteriophages  Certain genetic elements derived from viruses  such as highly effective promoters  are commonly used in molecular biology research today   Growing animal viruses outside of the living host animal is more difficult  Classically  fertilized chicken eggs have often been used  but cell cultures are increasingly employed for this purpose today   Since some viruses that infect eukaryotes need to transport their genetic material into the host cell s nucleus  they are attractive tools for introducing new genes into the host  known as transformation or transfection   Modified retroviruses are often used for this purpose  as they integrate their genes into the host s chromosomes   This approach of using viruses as gene vectors is being pursued in the gene therapy of genetic diseases  An obvious problem to be overcome in viral gene therapy is the rejection of the transforming virus by the immune system   Phage therapy  the use of bacteriophages to combat bacterial diseases  was a popular research topic before the advent of antibiotics and has recently seen renewed interest   Oncolytic viruses are viruses that preferably infect cancer cells  While early efforts to employ these viruses in the therapy of cancer failed  there have been reports in 2005 and 2006 of encouraging preliminary results   4  Other uses of viruses  A new application of genetically engineered viruses in nanotechnology was recently described  see the uses of viruses in material science and nanotechnology  For a use in mapping neurons see the applications of pseudorabies in neuroscience   5  History of virology  The word virus appeared in 1599 and originally meant  venom    A very early form of vaccination known as variolation was developed several thousand years ago in China  It involved the application of materials from smallpox sufferers in order to immunize others  In 1717 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu observed the practice in Istanbul and attempted to popularize it in Britain  but encountered considerable resistance  In 1796 Edward Jenner developed a much safer method  using cowpox to successfully immunize a young boy against smallpox  and this practice was widely adopted  Vaccinations against other viral diseases followed  including the successful rabies vaccination by Louis Pasteur in 1886  The nature of viruses however was not clear to these researchers   In 1892 Dimitri Ivanovski showed that a disease of tobacco plants  tobacco mosaic disease  was caused by an extremely minuscule infectious agent  capable of permeating porcelain Chamberland filters  something which bacteria could never do  He described his findings in an article  1892  and a dissertation  1902   In 1898 Martinus Beijerinck repeated Ivanovski s work but went further and passed the  filterable agent  from plant to plant  found the action undiminished  and concluded it infectious—replicating in the host—and thus not a mere toxin  He called it contagium vivum fluidum  The question of whether the agent was a  living fluid  or a particle was however still open   In 1903 it was suggested for the first time that transduction by viruses might cause cancer  In 1908 Bang and Ellerman showed that a filterable virus could transmit chicken leukemia  data largely ignored till the 1930s when leukemia became regarded as cancerous  In 1911 Peyton Rous reported the transmission of chicken sarcoma  a solid tumor  with a virus  and thus Rous became  father of tumor virology   The virus was later called Rous sarcoma virus 1 and understood to be a retrovirus  Several other cancer causing retroviruses have since been described   The existence of viruses that infect bacteria  bacteriophages  was first recognized by Frederick Twort in 1911  and  independently  by Felix d Herelle in 1917  As bacteria could be grown easily in culture  this led to an explosion of virology research   The cause of the devastating Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was initially unclear  In late 1918  French scientists showed that a  filter passing virus  could transmit the disease to people and animals  fulfilling Koch s postulates   In 1926 it was shown that scarlet fever is caused by a bacterium that is infected by a certain bacteriophage   While plant viruses and bacteriophages can be grown comparatively easily  animal viruses normally require a living host animal  which complicates their study immensely  In 1931 it was shown that influenza virus could be grown in fertilized chicken eggs  a method that is still used today to produce vaccines  In 1937  Max Theiler managed to grow the yellow fever virus in chicken eggs and produced a vaccine from an attenuated virus strain  this vaccine saved millions of lives and is still being used today   Max Delbrück  an important investigator in the area of bacteriophages  described the basic  life cycle  of a virus in 1937  rather than  growing   a virus particle is assembled from its constituent pieces in one step  eventually it leaves the host cell to infect other cells  The Hershey Chase experiment in 1952 showed that only DNA and not protein enters a bacterial cell upon infection with bacteriophage T2  Transduction of bacteria by bacteriophages was first described in the same year   In 1949 John F  Enders  Thomas Weller and Frederick Robbins reported growth of poliovirus in cultured human embryonal cells  the first significant example of an animal virus grown outside of animals or chicken eggs  This work aided Jonas Salk in deriving a polio vaccine from deactivated polio viruses  this vaccine was shown to be effective in 1955   The first virus that could be crystalized and whose structure could therefore be elucidated in detail was tobacco mosaic virus  TMV   the virus that had been studied earlier by Ivanovski and Beijerink  In 1935  Wendell Stanley achieved its crystallization for electron microscopy and showed that it remains active even after crystallization  Clear X ray diffraction pictures of the crystallized virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941  Based on such pictures  Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955  Also in 1955  Heinz Fraenkel Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid  coat  protein can self assemble into functional virions  suggesting that this assembly mechanism is also used within the host cell  as Delbrück had proposed earlier   In 1963  the Hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg who went on to develop a hepatitis B vaccine   In 1965  Howard Temin described the first retrovirus  a virus whose RNA genome was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA  cDNA   then integrated into the host s genome and expressed from that template  The viral enzyme reverse transcriptase  which along with integrase is a distinguishing trait of retroviruses  was first described in 1970  independently by Howard Temin and David Baltimore  The first retrovirus infecting humans was identified by Robert Gallo in 1974  Later it was found that reverse transcriptase is not specific to retroviruses  retrotransposons which code for reverse transcriptase are abundant in the genomes of all eukaryotes  About 10 40% of the human genome derives from such retrotransposons   In 1975 the functioning of oncoviruses was clarified considerably  Until that time  it was thought that these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which  when inserted into the host s genome  would cause cancer  Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus showed that the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus is in fact not specific to the virus but is contained in the genome of healthy animals of many species  The oncovirus can switch this pre existing benign proto oncogene on  turning it into a true oncogene that causes cancer   1976 saw the first recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease  a highly lethal virally transmitted disease   In 1977  Frederick Sanger achieved the first complete sequencing of the genome of any organism  the bacteriophage Phi X 174  In the same year  Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp independently showed that the genes of adenovirus contain introns and therefore require gene splicing  It was later realized that almost all genes of eukaryotes have introns as well   A worldwide vaccination campaign led by the UN World Health Organization resulted in the eradication of smallpox in 1979   In 1982  Stanley Prusiner discovered prions and showed that they cause scrapie   The first cases of AIDS were reported in 1981  and HIV  the retrovirus causing it  was identified in 1983 by Luc Montagnier  Françoise Barré Sinoussi and Robert Gallo  Tests detecting HIV infection by detecting the presence of HIV antibody were developed  Subsequent tremendous research efforts turned HIV into the best studied virus  Human Herpes Virus 8  the cause of Kaposi s sarcoma which is often seen in AIDS patients  was identified in 1994  Several antiretroviral drugs were developed in the late 1990s  decreasing AIDS mortality dramatically in developed countries   The Hepatitis C virus was identified using novel molecular cloning techniques in 1987  leading to screening tests that dramatically reduced the incidence of post transfusion hepatitis   The first attempts at gene therapy involving viral vectors began in the early 1980s  when retroviruses were developed that could insert a foreign gene into the host s genome  They contained the foreign gene but did not contain the viral genome and therefore could not reproduce  Tests in mice were followed by tests in humans  beginning in 1989  The first human studies attempted to correct the genetic disease severe combined immunodeficiency  SCID   but clinical success was limited  In the period from 1990 to 1995  gene therapy was tried on several other diseases and with different viral vectors  but it became clear that the initially high expectations were overstated  In 1999 a further setback occurred when 18 year old Jesse Gelsinger died in a gene therapy trial  He suffered a severe immune response after having received an adenovirus vector  Success in the gene therapy of two cases of X linked SCID was reported in 2000   In 2002 it was reported that poliovirus had been synthetically assembled in the laboratory  representing the first synthetic organism  Assembling the 7741 base genome from scratch  starting with the virus s published RNA sequence  took about two years  In 2003 a faster method was shown to assemble the 5386 base genome of the bacteriophage Phi X 174 in 2 weeks   The giant mimivirus  in some sense an intermediate between tiny prokaryotes and ordinary viruses  was described in 2003 and sequenced in 2004   The strain of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 that killed up to 50 million people during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 was reconstructed in 2005  Sequence information was pieced together from preserved tissue samples of flu victims  viable virus was then synthesized from this sequence  The 2009 flu pandemic involved another strain of Influenza A H1N1  commonly known as  swine flu    By 1985  Harald zur Hausen had shown that two strains of Human papillomavirus  HPV  cause most cases of cervical cancer  Two vaccines protecting against these strains were released in 2006   In 2006 and 2007 it was reported that introducing a small number of specific transcription factor genes into normal skin cells of mice or humans can turn these cells into pluripotent stem cells  known as Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells  The technique uses modified retroviruses to transform the cells  this is a potential problem for human therapy since these viruses integrate their genes at a random location in the host s genome  which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes cancer   In 2008  Sputnik virophage was described  the first known virophage  it uses the machinery of a helper virus to reproduce and inhibits reproduction of that helper virus  Sputnik reproduces in amoeba infected by mamavirus  a relative of the mimivirus mentioned above and the largest known virus to date   6  See also  Introduction to viruses  Virus  Virus
