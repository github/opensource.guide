Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini    3 November 1801 – 23 September 1835  was an Italian opera composer  who was known for his long flowing melodic lines for which he was named  the Swan of Catania   Many years later  in 1898  Giuseppe Verdi  praised the broad curves of Bellini s melody   there are extremely long melodies as no one else had ever made before     A very large amount of what is known about Bellini s life and his activities comes from surviving letters—except for a short period—which were written over his lifetime to his friend Francesco Florimo  whom he had met as a fellow student in Naples and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship  Other sources of information come from correspondence saved by other friends and business acquaintances   Bellini was the quintessential composer of the Italian bel canto era of the early 19th century and his work has been summed up by the London critic Tim Ashley as   In considering which of his operas can be seen to be his greatest successes over the almost two hundred years since his death  Il pirata laid much of the groundwork in 1827  achieving very early recognition in comparison to Donizetti s having written thirty operas before his major 1830 triumph with Anna Bolena  Both I Capuleti ed i Montecchi at La Fenice in 1830 and La sonnambula in Milan in 1831 reached new triumphal heights  although initially Norma  given at La Scala in 1831 did not fare as well until later performances elsewhere   The genuine triumph  of I puritani in January 1835 in Paris capped a significant career  Certainly  Capuleti  La sonnambula  Norma  and I puritani are regularly performed today   After his initial success in Naples  most of the rest of his short life was spent outside of both Sicily and Naples  those years being followed with his living and composing in Milan and Northern Italy  and—after a visit to London—then came his final masterpiece in Paris    I puritani  Only nine months later  Bellini died in Puteaux  France at the age of 33   1  Catania  Early life  Born in Catania  at the time part of the Kingdom of Sicily  the eldest of seven children in the family  he became a child prodigy within a highly musical family  His grandfather  Vincenzo Tobia Bellini  had studied at the conservatory in Naples and  in Catania from 1767 forward  had been an organist and teacher  as had Vincenzo s father  Rosario   An anonymous twelve page hand written history  held in Catania s Museo Belliniano  states that he could sing an aria by Valentino Fioravanti at eighteen months  that he began studying music theory at two years of age and the piano at three  By the age of five  he could apparently play  marvelously   The document states that Bellini s first five pieces were composed when he was just six years old and  at seven he was taught Latin  modern languages  rhetoric  and philosophy   Author Herbert Weinstock regards some of these accounts as no more than myths  not being supported from other  more reliable sources  Additionally  he makes the point in regard to Bellini s apparent knowledge of languages and philosophy   Bellini never became a well educated man    However  it appears that his career as a musician was never in doubt  Living with his grandfather after 1816 and learning from him  the young composer began to produce some pieces of music  among them the nine Versetti da cantarsi il Venerdi Santo  eight of which were based on texts by Metastasio  Another author  Stellios Galatopoulos  considers more of the  facts  presented in the précis  but does provide a reliable source for these compositions and expresses some skepticism regarding the young Bellini as being a child prodigy   With several other orchestral pieces completed  by 1818 Bellini was ready for further study and  logically  this would have to be in Naples  However  family support was limited  but the new intendente of the province of Catania  who came from Palermo  Stefano Notabartolo  the duca di San Martino e Montalbo and his duchess  encouraged the young man to petition the city fathers for a stipend to support his musical studies  This was successfully achieved in May 1819 with unanimous agreement for a four year pension to allow him to study at the Real Collegio di Musica di San Sebastiano in Naples  Thus  he left Catania in July carrying letters of introduction to several powerful individuals  including Giovanni Carafa who was the intendente of the Real Collegio as well as being in charge of the city s royal theatres  The young Bellini was to live in Naples for the following eight years   2  Naples  Musical education  The Conservatorio di San Sebastiano  as it had been named when the original Real Collegio di Musica  established in 1806 and then renamed as such in 1808  had moved to more spacious facilities close to the church of Gesù Novo and the building formerly occupied by the nuns of San Sabastiano  was run by the government and there  students  who wore semi military uniform  were obliged to live under a tight daily regimen of classes in principal subjects  in singing and instrumental coaching  plus basic education  Their days were long  going from early morning mass at 5 15am to finally end by 10pm  Although beyond the normal age for admission  Bellini had submitted ten pieces of music for consideration  these clearly demonstrated his talent  although he did need to do remedial work to correct some of his faulty technique   The focus of study was on the masters of the Neapolitan school and the orchestral works of Haydn and Mozart  with the emphasis put upon the Italian classical era composers such as Pergolesi and Paisiello  rather than the  modern day  approaches of composers such as Rossini  The young student s first teacher was Giovanni Furno  with whom  he studied exercises in harmony and accompaniment   another  from whom he learned counterpoint  was the composer of over 50 operas  Giacomo Tritto  but whom he found to be  old fashioned and doctrinaire   However  the artistic director of the school was the opera composer  Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli  By 1822 23  Bellini had become a member of a class which he taught  the older man appears to have recognised Bellini s potential and treated his student like a son  giving him some firm advice   It was during these early years at the Collegio that Bellini met Francesco Florimo with whom he had a lifetime of correspondence  Other fellow students—who were to become opera composers—included Francesco Stabile and the Ricci brothers—Luigi and Federico—as well as Saverio Mercadante who  by this time  was a graduate student   Another person to whom the young student composer was introduced was Gaetano Donizetti whose ninth opera—which had been a great success in Rome—was given at the Teatro di San Carlo  About 50 years later  Florimo gave an account of the meeting of the two men   Carlo Conti  one of Bellini s tutors  said to Bellini and me   Go and hear Donizetti s La zingara  for which my admiration increases at every performance   After hearing the opera  Donizetti acquired the score  convinced Conti to introduce him  and  Florimo  reports that Bellini s reaction was that he was  a truly beautiful  big man  and his noble countenance—sweet  but at the same time majestic—arouses affection as well as respect    Increasingly  Bellini did better and better in his studies  in January 1820 he passed his examinations in theory  and was successful enough to gain an annual scholarship  which meant that his stipend from Catania could be used to help his family  In the following January he was equally successful and  to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania—a condition of his scholarship—he sent a Messa di gloria which was performed the following October  His involvement in Zingarelli s class took place over the 1822 23 school year  By January 1824  after passing examinations where he did very well  resulted in his being given the title of primo maestrino  a post which required him to tutor younger students  allowed him to have a room of his own in the Collegio  and also allowed him visits to the opera on Thursdays and Sundays  where he saw his first opera by Rossini  Semiramide  While Weinstock gives an account of how he was  clearly captivated by the music of Rossini    he put Rossini on a pedestal   he relates that  returning from the performance Bellini was unusually quiet and then  suddenly exclaimed to his companions   Do you know what I think  After Semiramide  it s futile for us to try and achieve anything     An additional challenge confronted the young composer  how to win the hand of young Maddalena Fumarolis whom he had met as a guest in her home and then had become her music tutor  As their affair became obvious to her parents  they were forbidden to see each other  Bellini was determined to obtain the parents  permission for them to marry  and some writers regard this as the propelling reason for his writing his first opera   The impetus to write this opera came about in late summer or early autumn of 1824  Given his status at the conservatoire  Bellini learned that he had been selected to compose an opera for presentation at the Collegio s teatrino  This became Adelson e Salvini an opera semi seria  half serious  from a libretto by the Neapolitan Andrea Leone Tottola  who had written the one for Donizetti s La zingara  Adelson was first given sometime between mid January and mid March 1825  The opera featured an all male cast of fellow students and proved to be so popular among the Conservatory s student population that it was performed every Sunday for a year   With that achievement behind him  it is believed that the young Bellini  who had been away from home for six years  set out for Catania to visit his family  However  some sources attribute the visit to 1824  others to 1825  However  it is known that he was back in Naples by the summer or early autumn of 1825 in order to fulfill a contract to write an opera for the San Carlo or one of the other royal theatres  the Teatro Fondo   3  Career in music  early success in Naples  Following the presentation of Adelson e Salvini and while he was in Milan  Bellini—requesting help from Florio—began to make some revisions  expanding the opera to two acts in the hope that it might be given stagings by Domenico Barbaja  the Intendant at the Teato di San Carlo since 1809  But little is known about exactly how much Bellini or Florimo contributed to the revisions  and Weinstock asserts that no performances were ever given after 1825  but in March 1829  we find Bellini writing to Florimo that  I have written you the changes that you should make in Adelson     In the summer or early autumn of 1825 Bellini began work on what was to become his first professionally produced opera  A contract between the Conservatory and the royal theatres obliged the Conservatory—when it nominated a sufficiently talented student—to require that student to write a cantata or one act opera to be presented on a gala evening in one of the theatres  After Zingarelli used his influence to secure this honour for his promising student  Bellini was able to obtain agreement that he could write a full length opera and  furthermore  that the libretto did not have to be written by Tottola  the theatres  official dramatic poet  However  as Intendant of the San Carlo   Barbaja was the chief beneficiary   With a small investment he found among those young men the one who would lead him to large profits   notes Florimo   The young composer chose Domenico Gilardoni  a young writer who then prepared his first libretto  which he named Bianca e Fernando  based on an 1820 play  Bianca e Fernando alla tomba di Carlo IV  Duca d Agrigento and set in Sicily   However  the title Bianca e Fernando had to be changed  because Ferdinando was the name of the heir to the throne  and no form of it could be used on a royal stage  After some delays caused by King Francesco I forcing postponement  the opera—now named Bianca e Gernando—was given its premiere performance at the Teatro di San Carlo on 30 May 1826  Prince Ferdinando s name day   It was very successful  helped by the approval of the King  who broke the custom of there being no applause at a performance attended by royalty  It was also attended by Donizetti who enthusiastically wrote to Mayr   It is beautiful  beautiful  beautiful  especially as it is his first opera   Bellini s music was highly regarded  with the Giornale delle Due Sicilie on 13 June noting that   several of the arias and duets  are some of the most laudable pieces of new music heard in recent times at the  San Carlo    However  there were reservations about Gilardoni s contribution   Within nine months  in February March 1827  Domenico Barbaja offered Bellini a commission for an opera to be presented in the autumn of 1827 at Milan s La Scala  of which between 1821 and 1832  Barbaja was also part of the management   4  Northern Italy  operas from 1827 to 1833  Bellini spent 1827 to 1833 mostly in Milan  never holding any official position within an opera company and living solely from the income produced from his compositions  for which he was able to ask higher than usual fees   Upon his arrival  he met Antonio Villa of La Scala and composer Saverio Mercadante whose new opera  Il Montanaro was in rehearsal  The latter introduced him to Francesco and Marianna Pollini  an older couple  the husband a retired professor of piano  the wife a better than amateur musician  who immediately took the young man under their wing   In addition  Bellini was introduced to the librettist Felice Romani  who proposed the subject of the composer’s first project  Il pirata  to which the young man willingly agreed especially when he realised that the story  provided several passionate and dramatic situations    and   that such Romantic characters were then an innovation on the operatic stage   A strong professional relationship with Romani began from that time  he became Bellini’s primary creative partner  providing the libretti for six of Bellini’s operas which followed  in addition to about 100 libretti written for the major composers of the day  up to and including Verdi  As has been observed   no other Italian opera composer of the time showed such an attachment to a single librettist  and although Romani was known to treat composers poorly  he evidently had great respect for Bellini  even acceding to his requests for revisions  For his part  Bellini admired  the sonorous and elegance of the poet s verses   While in Milan    Bellini  quickly gained an entrée into higher social circles   although he also stayed for months at a time with friends  the Cantù and the Turina families  It was with Giuditta Turina that he began an affair in 1828 during the premiere performances of Bianca e Fernando in Genoa   The four years in Northern Italy between 1827 and 1831 produced four great masterpieces  Il pirata  I Capuleti e i Montecchi  La sonnambula  and Norma  along with a revival and a setback   4 1  Il pirata  Milan  October 1827  The collaboration with Romani on Il pirata began in May 1827 and  by August  the music was being written  By then  the composer was aware that he was to write music for his favourite tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and the soprano was to be Henriette Méric Lalande  Both singers had starred in Bianca in the original 1826 production  The strong cast also included Antonio Tamburini  a major bass baritone of the time  But rehearsals did not progress without some difficulties  as both Weinstock and Galatopoulos recount  it appears that Bellini found Rubini  while singing beautifully  to be lacking expressiveness  he was urged to  throw yourself with all your sole into the character you are representing  and to use  your  body   to accompany your singing with gestures   as well as to act with  your  voice  It appears that Bellini s exhortations bore fruit  based on his own account of the audience s reactions to the first performance  as well as the reaction of Milan s Gazzetta priviligiata of 2 December which noted that this opera  introduced us to Rubini s dual personality as a singer and actor   The reviewer continued to declare that this duality had never been expressed in other operas in which he had performed   The premiere  given on 17 October 1827  was  an immediate and then an increasing  success  By Sunday  December 2  when the season ended  it had been sung to fifteen full houses   For Rubini   it marked the defining performance for the tenor   and the newspaper reviews which followed all agreed with the composer s own assessment   After its Milanese debut  the opera received very successful performances in Vienna in February 1828 and also in Naples three months later  Both productions starred Rubini  Tamburini  and—in the role of Imogene—Rubini s wife  Adelaide Comelli Rubini  about whom Bellini had initial misgivings  although it appears that she acquitted herself very well  By this time  Bellini had begun to achieve international fame   4 2  Bianca e Fernando  Genoa  April 1828  After Il pirata  Bellini remained in Milan with the hope of securing another commission  One came from Genoa via Bartolomeo Merelli on 13 January 1828 for a new opera for presentation on 7 April  However  without knowing which singers would be engaged  he was unwilling to commit at that time  but remained in hope of something definite from La Scala for the autumn  When no alternatives appeared  he accepted Genoa s offer in February  but it was then too late to write anything new  He immediately proposed a revival and re working of Bianca e Gernando  this time with the original title Bianca e Fernando  there being no royal by the name of Fernando in the House of Savoy  Romani wrote to Florimo in Naples and told him that he had taken on the re construction of the libretto  with the result that  out of the whole of Bianca  the only pieces entirely unchanged are the big duet and the romanza  everything else is altered  and about half of it is new   Bellini then re arranged the music to suit the singers  voices  now knowing that the Bianca was to be Adelaide Tosi and the Fernando to be Giovanni David   As Bellini reports  he had problems with Tosi wanting changes to be made to a cavatina and a stretta in one scene  but he stuck to his own opinion  proving to be correct when he reported the audience s reaction to Florimo   the public was very happy with the entire opera  particularly with the second act   Overall  the first performance was even greater than it had been in Naples  and the opera was given a total of 21 times  However  critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience   The second act is a long bore  stated L Eco di Milano  although the Gazzetta di Genova was more helpful  noting  the more we listen to the style of the music  the more we appreciate its merit    4 3  After Bianca  Bellini remained in Genoa until 30 April and then returned to Milan  but with no specific opportunity in place  His initial opposition to Comelli Rubini being allowed to reprise the role of Imogene in Il pirata for performances in Naples  as she had done in Vienna—but successfully  was proved to be wrong  since she did sing well there and received general approval  But this issue had caused complications in his relationship with Barbaja  who controlled both theatres  and when he visited Milan in June  he offered Bellini the opportunity to choose between Naples and Milan as the venue for his next opera  For the composer  the decision hung on the availability of singers for each of the houses  especially because Rubini was contracted to sing only in Naples  However  by 16 June  he had decided on the location to be Milan  and then signed a contract to write a new opera for the Carnival season for a fee of one thousands ducati  compared to 150 ducati for his first opera   4 4  La straniera  Milan  February 1829  For La straniera  Bellini received a fee which was sufficient for him to be able to make his living solely by composing music  and this new work became an even greater success than Il pirata had been  As for singers  it appears there was some doubt about the tenor  but that Henriette Méric Lalande  Luigi Lablache  or Tamburini   would be available  In consultation with Romani as to the subject  it was agreed that it would be based on the novel L étrangère  Il solitario  of 1825 by Charles Victor Prévot  vicomte d Arlincourt  and planned for the premiere on the opening night of the season on 26 December   However  by 20 September  Bellini told Florimo that he did not think the performance could take place as scheduled due to Romani being ill  In addition  he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when he had been unable to obtain Rubini s release from his Naples contract  Berardo Calvari  known as Winter  was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala  Fortunately  having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina  he was able to secure his services  describing him in a letter to Florimo as  one who will want to do himself honour  everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful  and that he has all the acting and spirit one could wish for    Following Romani s recovery  the delivery of the libretto arrived piecemeal  but Bellini set to work again  progress was slow  By 7 January 1829  with Romani having recovered and set off for Venice to fulfill a contract  the composer was  almost up to the 2nd act   Filippo Cicconetti  in his 1859 biography  gives an account of Bellini s working methods  explaining how he set texts to music always with the words in front of him in order to see how inspired to compose he might become  When it came time to compose the final aria Or sei pago  ol ciel tremendo  the librettist s words gave him no inspiration at all and  at their next meeting  Romani agreed to re write the text  Returning within half an hour  the second version left Bellini equally cold—as did a third draft  Finally  when asked what it was that he was seeking  Bellini replied   I want a thought that will be at one and the same time a prayer  an imprecation  a warning  a delirium       A fourth draft was quickly prepared   Have I entered into your spirit   asked the librettist—and he was embraced by the young composer   Rehearsals began in early January with the premiere planned for 14 February 1829  it was an immediate and resounding success with the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano on 16 February declaring it to be a   Three days later  the same publication praised the quality of the music  describing Bellini as  a modern Orpheus  for the beauty of his melodies  Reporting to Romani  who was still in Venice  Bellini gave an account of the success   the thing went as we never had imagined it  We were in seventh heaven  With  this letter  receive my gratitude more than ever      Others wrote equally enthusiastic reports  with abundant praise being given to the singers as well  However  there were detractors who criticised both the opera and its composer  its new style and its restless harmonic shifts into remote keys did not please all  45 years later it was stated that  Bellini s style was abstruse  discontinuous  distorted  and lacking in distinction  that it alternated among the serio and the buffo and the semi sererio    4 5  Zaira  a setback  Parma  May 1829  Zaira was the opera which came into being following discussions with Barbaja in Milan in June 1828 for a second opera for La Scala  At around the same time  Bellini reported to Florimo that he had been approached by Merelli about writing an inaugural opera for the soon to be completed Teatro Ducale  now the Teatro Regio  in Parma which was due to open during the following year on 12 May 1829  Initially  the opera was to be Carlo di Borgogna  but composer and librettist decided to tackle  a drama so   hallowed as Voltaire s Zaïre   but this proved to be more challenging for Romani than first imagined   With this opera  Bellini encountered  the first serious setback of a hitherto brilliant career   Several reason have been put forward  Lippmann and McGuire note  it was because  Bellini showed too little enthusiasm for the undertaking   Another writer attributes it to Parma s traditional love of and favouritism towards the music of Rossini  while yet another notes that a combination of the composer being constantly seen in cafes around the city  when it was assumed that he should have been composing  and the fact that Romani had included a long explanation of the difficulties of adapting Voltaire in the printed libretto provided to all operagoers  The librettist was critical of his own work   the style should have been more careful  and that here and there  certain repetitions of phrases and concepts should have been edited out   At the same time  he stated that  with music composed to those verses now in place   I was not permitted to go back over what already had been done  and poetry and music were finished in less than a month   This short period of time compares to the months which  for example  it took Bellini to write Il pirata   In fact  Bellini arrived in Parma on 17 March giving him 56 days before the opening  but he then learned that some of the singers would only arrive 14 days before the date of the premiere  a date that was—in theory— unchangeable  In fact  it had to be changed due to the inability of Lalande to arrive in time for sufficient rehearsal  Both composer and librettist were somewhat dilatory  delaying work as much and as long as possible  Count Sanvitale s request on 17 April  asking  to let me know the reasons why our copyists are kept idle   did not receive much of response to satisfy the theatre s management  Eventually  both men got down to work and finished on time  although the premiere was delayed by four days   The general impression given by reports in the press was that  overall  the music was weak  although some numbers and the trio were liked  However  for the most part  the singers were applauded  even if the composer received little  The opera received eight performances  followed by some poorly received ones in Florence in 1836  and then it disappeared until 1976   4 6  May 1829 to March 1830  After the poor response in Parma to Zaira  Bellini stayed with Ferdinando and Giuditta Turina s family for a short period in May June and then returned to Milan by the end of June and discovered that his grandfather  then 85  had died in Catania  No contract for another opera in sight  except for the possibility of working with the Teatro La Fenice in Venice  As is revealed by Herbert Weinstock  there is limited knowledge of what happened to Bellini between June 1833 and February 1834  since no letters to Florimo from that period have survived  and the only sources are those letters sent to others   Giovanni Pacini  another Catanese composer  was still in Milan in late June after the well received premiere on 10 June of his opera Il Talismano at La Scala  where it went on to receive a total of 16 performances  To Bellini  he appeared to be a rival  and with his recent success  Pacini received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the Carnival season  He accepted both offers  but the La Fenice impresario included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract  then it would be transferred to Bellini   Bellini then became preoccupied with staging a revival of his Il pirata during the summer season at the Teatro Canobbiana because La Scala was closed for repairs  Pirata was staged with the original cast and again was a triumph  it received 24 consecutive performances between 16 July and 23 August 1829  thus outnumbering Pacini s   During July and August  the composer Giachino Rossini visited Milan on his way to Bologna  He saw the Pirata production and met Bellini  the two men were taken with each other  to the extent that when the younger composer was in Paris a year or two later  he developed a very strong bond with Rossini  A firm offer of a contract for a new opera for Venice appeared in the autumn  a contract which also included a provision that Il pirata would be given during the Carnival 1830 season  Tearing himself away from dalliances with La Turina  by mid December Bellini was in Venice where Giuseppe Persiani s Constantino in Arles was in rehearsal with the same singers who were to perform in Pirata  they were Giuditta Grisi  the tenor Lorenzo Bonfigli  and Giulio Pellegrini   4 7  I Capuleti e i Montecchi  Venice  March 1830  With rehearsals for Pirata underway in late December  Bellini was given notice by the La Fenice impresario  Alessandro Lanari  that it was doubtful whether Pacini would be present in time to stage an opera and that a contract was to be prepared with the proviso that it would only become effective on 14 January  Accepting the offer 5 January  Bellini stated that he would set Romani s libretto for Giulietta Capellio  that he required 45 days between receipt of the libretto and the first performance  and that he would accept 325 napoleoni d oro  about 8 000 lire    The tentative contract deadline was extended until 20 January  but by that date Romani was in Venice  having already re worked much of his earlier libretto which he had written for Nicola Vaccai s 1825 opera  Giulietta e Romeo  the source for which was the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola which had been written in 1818  The two men set to work  but with the winter weather in Venice becoming increasingly bad  Bellini fell ill  however  he had to continue to work under great pressure within a now limited timetable  Eventually  revisions to Romani s libretto were agreed to  a new title was given to the work  and Bellini reviewed his score of Zaira to see how some of the music could be set to the new text  but composing the part of Romeo for Grisi  He also took Giulietta’s  Oh quante volte  and Nelly’s romanza from Adelson e Salvini  The Giulietta was to be sung by Rosalbina Caradori Allan   At the premiere of I Capuleti e i Montecchi on 11 March 1830 success for Bellini returned  Weinstock describes the premiere as  an unclouded and immediate success  but it was only able to be performed eight times before the La Fenice season closed on 21 March  A local newspaper  I Teatri  reported that  all things considered  this opera by Bellini has aroused as much enthusiasm in Venice as La straniera aroused in Milan from the first evening on    By this time  Bellini knew that he had achieved a degree of fame  writing on 28 March  he stated that   Before leaving Venice  Bellini was offered a contract to produce another new opera for La Fenice for the 1830—31 Carnival season  and—upon his return to Milan after a reunion with Turina—he also found an offer from Genoa for a new opera but proposed for the same time period  an offer he was forced to reject   Later that year  Bellini prepared a version of Capuleti for La Scala which was given on 26 December  lowering Giulietta’s part for the mezzo soprano    4 8  La sonnambula  Milan  March 1831  Returning to Milan after the Capuleti performances  little occurred until the latter part of April when changes began to appear in the management of La Scala  The organisation   Criveli and Company  which had managed both that house as well as La Fenice  was negotiating with a triumvirate consisting of Duke Pompeo Litta and two businessmen  their immediate concern being the engagement of singers and composers for La Scala  In order to contract with Bellini  he had to be released from his obligation to Venice  this was achieved by Litta buying out the Venice contract  When Bellini laid out his terms for writing for Milan  Litta gave him a very favourable response   I shall earn almost twice as much as if I had composed for Crivelli  then the Venetian impresario   he noted in a letter to his uncle   However  the group led by Duke Litta failed to come to terms with the Criveli Lanari Barbaja group which continued to manage both La Scala and La Fenice  As a result  in the April–May 1830 period  Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with both the Litta group—which was planning performances in a smaller Milan house  the —and with the Criveli group to obtain a contract for an opera for the autumn of 1831 and another for the 1832 Carnival season  These were to become Norma for La Scala and Beatrice di Tenda for La Fenice   Bellini then experienced the re occurrence of an illness which had emerged in Venice due to pressure of work and the bad weather  but which consistently recurred after each opera and which would eventually cause his death  The gastro enteric condition—which he describes as  a tremendous inflammatory gastric bilious fever — resulted in his being cared for by Francesco Pollini and his wife at their home because  as Bellini wrote   he loves me more than a son    Having recovered from his illness by the summer  Bellini went to stay near Lake Como  The need to decide on the subject for the following winter s opera became pressing  although it had already been agreed that Giuditta Pasta  who had achieved success in the Teatro Carcano in 1829 and 1830 with in several major operas  would be the principal artist  That she owned a house near Como and would be staying there over the summer was the reason that Romani traveled to meet her and Bellini   4 8 1  * Attempts to create Ernani  By 15 July they had decided on an adaptation of Victor Hugo s play  Hernani  although Weinstock speculates as to how this decision could have come about  The play s political subject matter would have been known to the group and they would certainly know of the strict censorship then in existence in Austrian controlled Lombardy  In addition  it was uncertain as to whether Pasta was interested in singing a trousers role  that of the protagonist  Ernani  While it seems that all three were in agreement  no further progress was made  Romani  who promised to begin the Ernani libretto immediately  went off to write one for what became Donizetti s Anna Bolena  which opened the Carcano s season in December 1830   Rather than resting  Bellini immediately set off for Bergamo to stage La straniera  then went back to the mountains  But  by the end of November  nothing had been achieved in the way of writing either the libretto or the score of Ernani   On 3 January 1831  a letter from Bellini stated      I am no longer composing Ernani because the subject would have had to undergo some modifications at the hands of the police      Romani  is now writing La sonnambula  ossia I Due Fidanzati svezzeri     It must go on stage on 20 February at the latest    4 8 2  * La sonnambula replaces Ernani  Romani s libretto for La sonnambula was based on a ballet pantomime by Eugène Scribe and Jean Pierre Aumer called La somnambule  ou L arrivée d un nouveau seigneur  With its pastoral setting and story  La sonnambula was to become another triumphant success during Bellini s five years in Milan   The title role of Amina  the sleepwalker  with its high tessitura is renowned for its difficulty  requiring a complete command of trills and florid technique  It was written for Pasta who has been described as a soprano sfogato  That music which he was beginning to use for Ernani was transferred to Sonnambula is not in doubt  and as Weinstein comments   he was as ready as most other composers of his era to reuse in a new situation musical passages created for a different  earlier one    The opera s premiere performance took place on 6 March 1831  a little later than the original date  at the Teatro Carcano  Its success was partly due to the differences between Romani s earlier libretti and this one  as well as  the accumulation of operatic experience which both  Bellini  and Romani had brought to its creation   Press reactions were universally positive  as was that of the Russian composer  Mikhail Glinka  who attended and wrote overwhelmingly enthusiastically   During Bellini s lifetime another sfogato  Maria Malibran  was to become a notable exponent of the role  After its premiere  the opera was performed in London on 28 July 1831 at the King’s Theatre and in New York on 13 November 1835 at the Park Theatre   4 9  Norma  Milan  December 1831  With La sonnambula successfully behind them  Bellini and Romani began to consider the subject of the opera for which they had been contracted by the Crivelli group for a December 1831 premiere at La Scala and which would mark Giuditta Pasta s debut at that house  By the summer  they had decided upon Norma  ossia L Infanticidio which was based on the play of the same name  Norma  or The Infanticide by Alexandre Soumet which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen   For the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione  La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi  the sister of Giuditta  and the well known tenor Domenico Donzelli  who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles  especially that of Otello  He provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which Mercadante also provided  By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto  enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work  which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied  He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September   Pasta s vocal and dramatic ranges were extensive  that March  she had created the very different Bellini role of Amina  the Swiss village maiden  in La sonnambula   As the year progressed  several things appeared which began to disturb the composer  Firstly  an outbreak of cholera had occurred in Austria in July  and concern about its spread to Italy was real  to the point that  by late September  Bellini was writing to Florimo   I am composing the opera without any real zeal because I am almost certain that the cholera will arrive in time to close the theatres  but as soon it threatens to come near  I ll leave Milan    About this time he had received an offer to compose for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples and  in return  had imposed some harsh terms  totally objecting to the English soprano Marianna Lewis   a donna who is below mediocrity  does not know how to sing  is a sausage on stage     He continues by stressing the need for a good tenor were he to come to Naples and  in a separate letter to be forwarded by Florimo  tells Principe di Ruffano  then the superintendent of the royal theatres  that he doubts that Barbaja would even agree to the fee already offered to him by La Scala  a total of 2 400 ducati  when he would want 3 000 ducati from Naples for all the additional expenses which he would incur  In a post script  Bellini adds an indignant objection to what he has heard about the proposed casting of Capuleti in Naples  It is clear that he regards Barbaja as an enemy   Norma was completed by about the end of November  Bellini then had to deal with the issue of piracy in regard to vocal reductions for piano of La sonnambula as published by Casa Ricordi  These scores were then fully orchestrated and sold to unsuspecting opera houses as full orchestral scores  This illegal action caused Bellini to publish a notice in major Italian newspapers putting such  pirates  on notice  but Weinstock comments that such attempts to control were not likely to succeed until Italian unification provided laws applicable to the country as a whole   After rehearsals began on 5 December  Pasta baulked at singing the Casta diva in act 1  now one of the most famous arias of the nineteenth century  She felt that it was  ill adapted to her vocal abilities   but Bellini was able to persuade her to keep trying for a week  after which she adapted to it and confessed her earlier error  At the opening night  the opera was received with what Weinstock describes as  chill indifference   To Florimo on the night of the premiere  Bellini wrote  Fiasco  Fiasco  Solemn fiasco   and proceed to tell him of the indifference of the audience and how it affected him   In addition  in a letter to his uncle on 28 December  Bellini tries to explain the reasons for the reactions  As other commentators have also noted  some problems were innate to the structure and content of the opera  while others were external to it  Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers  after rehearing the entire second on the day of the premiere  as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please—and failed to please the composer as well  But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective  It appears from the letter that the second evening s performance was more successful  Among the external reasons  Bellini cites the adverse reaction caused by the attitudes of both the owner of a journal  and his claque  and also of  a very rich woman —who Weinstock identifies as Contessa Giulia Samoyloff— who was Pacini s mistress  He also notes that on this second evening  the theatre was full   In all  Norma was given 39 performances in its first season at La Scala  and reports from elsewhere  especially those from Bergamo when performances were given there in late 1832  suggested that it was becoming more and more popular  Bellini left Milan for Naples  and then Sicily  on 5 January 1832  but for the first time since 1827  it was a year in which he did not write an opera   4 10  Naples  Sicily  Bergamo  January to September 1832  Bellini traveled to Naples  although he may have stopped in Rome to see Giuditta Turina and her brother Gaetano Cantù  However  the sister and brother also went to Naples where Giuditta was finally able to meet Florimo and see the city in which Bellini had triumphed  Within six days  Bellini was in Naples where he remained for six weeks   During that time he remained busy  spending some time with Turina  who was ill for part of it   visiting the conservatory and meeting with many of the students and his old teacher  Zingarelli  to whom he had dedicated Norma   and attending a performance of Capuleti at the San Carlo with Turina and Florimo on 5 February in the presence of King Ferdinand II  The King led the applause for the composer  resulting in his being called to the stage and thus enjoying a very warm welcome from the people of Naples   Planning to leave Naples by 25 February  he dealt with the invitation from Lanari at La Fenice to compose for that house by stating that he would not work for less than the sum received from the last production  and that he was also in discussions with the San Carlo  Arriving in Messina along with Florimo on the morning of 27 February  Bellini was greeted by several members of his family including his father  They remained in Messina for two days  attending a performance of Il pirata at the Teatro della Munizione  where he was greeted with  loud shouts of pleasure  hand clapping  and words of praise    Bellini arrived in Catania on 3 March to a civic welcome  He was greeted by the city s authorities and citizens who also feted him at a concert the following evening  This included excerpts from La sonnambula and Il pirata at the Teatro Communale  now replaced by the Teatro Massimo Bellini which was opened in 1890 and named in Bellini s honour  After a month  Bellini and Florimo left for Palermo where  once again  there was a  royal welcome  and where he made the acquaintance of Filippo Santocanale and his wife  Although weather delayed their departure for Naples  they continued to spend an enjoyable time there  but Bellini was anxious to return to Naples before Easter and to be with Giuditta Turina  who had remained in that city  They reached Naples on 25 April where he was reunited with Turina   Upon his arrival  Bellini wrote to his new friend Santocanale in Palermo  telling him that he would be accepting a contract from La Fenice so the issue had resurfaced in the form of a contract from Lanari which appeared to have accepted the composer s terms  But he had forgotten how much he had demanded  writing to Giuditta Pasta s husband  Giuseppe  he asked for the letter he had written to him  in which he had revealed the terms offered  to be sent to him to await his arrival in Florence  When returning to Naples  the couple reached Rome on 30 April  There is speculation that  when there  Bellini composed a one act opera  Il fu ed it sara  The Past and the Present  for a private performance  which was supposedly not given until 1832   but little further information—nor any of the music—has been forthcoming  It appears that the couple  along with Giuditta s brother  left for Florence on or around 20 May traveling by private coach and that he attended what he described as  a quite unrecognisable  performance of La sonnumbula at the Teatro della Pergola  In the same letter  Bellini informed his publisher that   He continues by stating that  in addition  he will receive one hundred percent of the rental rights of the scores   Within a few days  Bellini was in Milan  from there writing to his friend Santocanale in Palermo that  I m   trying to find a good subject for my new opera for Venice  In August  I shall go to Bergamo for the production of my Norma with Pasta   From Bergamo  he wrote to Romani  excited to tell him that   After the successful production in Bergamo  which was favourably reviewed by the same writer from the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano who was not enthusiastic about the original Milan production  Bellini spent a few days with Turina  and then  by mid September  had returned to Milan anxious to meet Romani to decide on the subject for the following February s opera for La Fenice for which a contract had become official  In addition  it had been agreed that the new opera would be preceded by performances of Norma and that they would open the season   4 11  Beatrice di tenda  Venice 1833  Beatrice di Tenda  with the leading role requiring a strong female character to be written for Pasta  composer and librettist met to consider a subject  Much of the initial work fell upon Romani  who had to look at a number of possible sources  and he became irritated by the task  finally hoping that a shipment of books from Paris would reveal a suitable one  It appears that by 6 October  a subject had been agreed upon  it would be Christina regina di Svenzia from a play by Alexander Dumas which had appeared in Paris in 1830  However  by one month later  Bellini was writing to Pasta to state that   Bellini s expectation that Romani s good will would be demonstrated promptly  turned out to be a mistake  The librettist had vastly over committed himself  by the time that Christina became Beatrice  he had made commitments to Mercadante for an October opera  also to Carlo Coccia for an opera for La Scala on 14 February 1833  and further  to Luigi Majocchi for a Parma production on 26 February  to Mercadante for La Scala on 10 March  and to Donizetti for Florence on 17 March  Nothing happened in November  Bellini announced that he would arrive in Venice in early December and after 10th  he became preoccupied with rehearsals for Norma  However  the lack of any verses—for an opera which was supposed to be staged in the second half of February—caused him to have to take action against Romani  This involved a complaint lodged with the governor of Venice who then contacted the governor of Milan  who then had his police contact Romani  The librettist finally arrived in Venice on 1 January 1833  He holed up to write Bellini s libretto  but  at the same time  Donizetti was equally incensed at delays in receiving a libretto from Romani for an opera which was to be Parisina   When Norma opened on 26 December  it was a success but only because of Pasta  The Adalgisa of Anna Del Serre and the Pollione of Alberico Curioni were mediocre  Bellini feared for how Beatrice would turn out  Writing to Santocanale on 12 January  Bellini was in despair  complaining of the short time to write his opera because  Whose fault is that  that of my usual and original poet  the God of Sloth   Their relationship quickly began to deteriorate  greetings including tu  the informal  you   gave way to voi  the formal  you   and they lived in different parts of Venice  However  by 14 February  Bellini was reporting that he had only  another three pieces of the opera to do  and that  I hope to go onstage here on 6 March if I am able to finish the opera and prepare it    As it turned out  Bellini was only able to prepare the opera for rehearsals by deleting sections of the libretto as well as some of the music for the finale  To create more time for Bellini to finish  at La Fenice Lanari padded the programme with older works or revivals  but that allowed only eight days for Beatrice before the scheduled end of the season  Not surprisingly  the audience greeted the opening night on 16 March with little enthusiasm  especially after Romani s plea for  the reader s full indulgence  appeared in the libretto  but at the following two performances there was a large crowd  For Bellini  his opera  was not unworthy of her sisters    4 12  The break with Romani  There then began what Herbert Weinstock describes in over twelve pages of text  which include the long letters written by both sides in the dispute   Three days before the premiere  the Venetian daily  the Gazzetta privilegiata di Venezia  had published a letter purportedly written to its editor by  A B   of Fonzaso  in Weinstein s view most certainly fabricated by Tommaso Locatelli  the musically sophisticated man who edited the paper  In the letter  he complained about the delay in the production of Beatrice as the end of the season became closer   Weinstock assumes that it is Locatelli who replied to  A B    asserting that Bellini and Romani were trying to achieve perfection before taking the opera to London  Then a torrent of anti Beatrice letters appeared after the first performance  followed by a pro Bellini reply  signed  A friend of M  Bellini   This letter removes the blame from Bellini and lays it at the feet of Romani  outlining the timetable for the delivery of the libretto  which was contracted to be due in two parts  one in October and then the second in November  The author states that  except for a limited amount of text  nothing had been received by mid January and the piece continues by describing the legal proceedings taken by Bellini and the various setbacks which occurred even after Romani arrived in Venice  On 2 April  this provoked a response from Romani himself  presenting his case against Bellini based largely on the composer s inability to decide on a subject  as well as justifying all the work which he did after arriving in Venice  only to find his melodramma  touched up in a thousand ways   in order to make it acceptable to  the Milords of the Thames  who  await him   a saracatic reference to planned trip to London  Another  a more  venomous  version of this letter  was sent to Milan s L Eco    Pietro Marinetti  replied from the pro Bellini camp in the Milan journal  Il Barbiere di Siviglia on 11 April  In  Two Words for Signor Felice Romani   but which takes five pages in print   he states that it is not his intention to defend the composer but  only to vent my displeasure given me and all sensitive people by the very sarcastic manner  full of personal rancor and hauteur  with which Signor Romani has undertaken to assail his antagonist   Not unexpectedly  a further  cannonade   says Weinstock  appeared from Romani  published this time in L Eco on 12 April 1833 with both an editor s preface  decrying the poor taste displayed by both sides  and a brief final response from Marinetti   The relationship begins to be repaired Having been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo for the 1834 1835 Carnival season  but declined because of his Paris commitment  he stated that May 1835 might be possible when he knew who were to be the contracted singers  Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend  indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835  Continuing his letter to Florimo  he states   From that statement of March 1834  it does not appear that animosity still existed on the composer s part  Through an intermediary  Bordesi  or Bordese   a mutual friend of both men  Romani initially expressed interest in re establishing friendly relations with Bellini  Thus  Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating   Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man  and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he  Bellini  says  whereas I do nothing but to talk about him to the entire universe   Then he ends with   Give him a kiss for me   This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings  which—it appears—did happen when he writes to Romani himself  most likely expansion of the initial draft  laying out a series of concerns  but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states  I have not ceased to love him  Bellini   for I recognise that the blame is not all his    In conclusion  Bellini suggests  draw ing  a veil over everything that happened   stating that he cannot come to Milan at this time but  since he was planning to write the opera for Naples for 1836  he could do so in January  1835  presumably after I puritani   He ends by saying that  if he does not hear back from Romani  he will not write to him again  Little is known about Romani s reply  but reply he did  as indicated in Bellini s letter to Florimo in October followed by a very friendly one on 7 October 1834 to the librettist  who had been engaged in Turin  and in which he states   It seemed impossible to exist without you   closing with  Write for Turin or for wherever  write for me alone  only for me  for your Bellini    Within a year of writing that letter  Bellini was dead  The two men never did meet again   5  London  April to August 1833  After leaving Venice on 26 March  before the barrage of letter writing began  it is known that Bellini spent some time with Turina in Milan and  leaving many of his personal possessions with her  appears to have planned to return there by August since he did not give up his rooms in the contrade dei Re Monasteri   With the Pastas and other members of the Italian troupe contracted for London by the impresario of the King s Theatre  Pierre François Laporte  Bellini and his troupe set off  On the journey it is known that he stopped in Paris and discussed with Dr  Louis Véron  the director of the Paris Opéra  the possibility of writing a French opera  but his intention was to focus on that subject on his return in the coming July   As Weinstock notes  when the Italians arrived in London by 27 April  Bellini was a known factor  many of his operas having already been given over the previous few years  His name is listed as an attendee in the Morning Chronicle of 29 April at a performance of Rossini s La cenerentola  along with those of Maria Malibran  Felix Mendelssohn  Nicolo Paganini  as well as Pasta  Rubini  and other visiting Italian singers  His operas which had been presented in London included Il pirata  with Henriette Méric Lalande in April 1830  followed by La sonnambula  with Pasta  and La straniera with Giuditta Grisi   In addition—and separate from Bellini s troupe at the King s Theatre—Maria Malibran was about to present her London debut in La sonnamula at the Theatre Royal  Drury Lane on 1 May in an English version with  an adapted Bellini score   It appears that Bellini had his first meeting with Malibran when attending a performance where  as he states   As the opera season progressed  Bellini found himself caught up in the social whirl  with invitations coming from all around him  His fame was now secure—La sonnambula having established it—and the premiere of Norma  given on 21 June with Pasta in the title role  was a triumph according to a long letter which Giuseppe Pasta wrote about the experience and his wife s huge success  as well as reports in the London press  including The Times of 23 June 1833  It took until late July for I Capuleti e i Montecchi to be given its London premiere and his contract was then over  He left for Paris by about mid August   6  Paris  August 1833 to January 1835  When he arrived in Paris in mid August 1833  Bellini had intended to stay only about three weeks  the main aim being to continue the negotations with the Opéra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier  While there was no agreement with Véron at the Opéra  the Théâtre Italien made him an offer which  Bellini notes  he accepted because  the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then  though only by a little  then because of so magnificent a company  and finally so as to remain in Paris at others  expense    In fact  Éduard Robert and Carlo Severini of the Italien had written to the composer  offering a seat in the their theatre during his stay in the city and telling him that Grisi  Unger  and Rubini would be singing Pirata in October and Capuleti in November  But with no definite arrangements having been made to compose for the Italian house—and Bellini essentially not wishing to proceed with an offer from Turin to stage Norma—he began to getting settled in a new  small apartment  He wrote to Florimo  telling him about the lodgings and that he had written to Turina not to sell any of his furniture  but to send some of it to him   Quickly  Bellini entered the fashionable world of the Parisian salon  most importantly that run by the Italian exile Princess Belgiojoso whom he had met in Milan and who  was by far the most overtly political of the salonnières   Her salon became a meeting place for Italian revolutionaries such as Vincenzo Gioberti  Niccolò Tommaseo  and Camillo Cavour  and it was there that he would have most likely made the acquaintance of Count Carlo Pepoli  Others that Bellini would have met included Victor Hugo  George Sand  Alexandre Dumas pėre  and Heinrich Heine  Among the many musical figures were several Italian such as Michele Carafa and the imposing Luigi Cherubini  then in his seventies   In terms of musical activity—or lack thereof—Bellini pleaded guilty in the letter to Florimo in March 1844   If you reflect for a moment that a young man in my position  in London and Paris for the first time  cannot help amusing himself immensely  you will excuse me   However  in January 1834  he had signed a contract to write a new opera for the Théâtre Italien which would be presented at the end of the year  At the same time  he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834 1835 Carnival season  but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers  Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer  indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835   On a professional level  Bellini became very concerned around the middle of April 1834  when he learned that Donizetti would be composing for the Théâtre Italien during the same season  1834—1835  According to Weinstock  quoting letters sent to Florimo in Italy at around that time  and continuing almost up to the premiere of I puritani   Bellini perceived this to be a plot orchestrated by Rossini  In a long  rambling letter of 2 500 words to Florino of 11 March 1834  he expresses his frustrations   But over a year later and with hindsight—after Puritani s great success which came way ahead of that of Donizetti s first work for Paris  Marin Faliero—he outlines  the plot which was being hatched against me  and the strategies which he adopted to counter it  These strategies included expanding his contacts with Rossini to secure his growing friendship by continuing to see him on numerous occasions to seek his advice  noting  I have always adored Rossini  and I succeeded  and happily     having  tamed Rossini s hatred  I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour   In a series of letters to Florimo throughoutthe year  he wrote of Rossini s increasing support  even love   I hear that he speaks well of me   4 September 1834       if I have Rossini s protection  I ll be situated very well   4 November    The most beautiful is that Rossini loves me very  very  very much   18 November   and     my very dear Rossini who now loves me as a son   21 January 1835  following the dress rehearsal    However  during the time during which he was composing Puritani  Bellini recounted the details of another bout of what he describes as  gastric fever  and which Weinstock describes as  that brief indisposition  which had been recurring almost every year at the onset of warm weather    6 1  I puritani  January 1834 to January 1835  Having signed the contract for a new opera  Bellini began to look around for a suitable subject and  in a letter to Florimo of 11 March 1834  he alludes to the opera which was to become I puritani  noting   I am about to lose my mind over the plot of the opera for Paris  as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company    In the same letter he continues by stating that he was working towards finding a subject with the Italian emigré  Count Pepoli  who came from a prominent Bologna family and who had been active in opposition to Austrian rule of Italy  until forced into exile in France and England  Although Pepoli had yet to write for the opera house  he made acquaintance with Bellini at one of the salons both attended  The process of writing the libretto and working with the composer was a struggle  notes Weinstock   added to by a period of illness which Bellini reports  although—on 11 April—he is able to report in a letter to Ferlito that he was well and that  I have chosen the story for my Paris opera  it is of the times of Cromvello  Cromwell   after he had King Charles I of England beheaded   In his letter  he continues by providing a synopsis  indicating that his favourite singers—Giulia Grisi  Rubini  Tamburini  and Lablache—would be available for the principal roles  and that he would begin to write the music by 15 April if he has received the verses  He also referred to the offer from Naples for April 1836 and noting his financial demands with the questions as to how this might be received   The chosen source was a play performed in Paris only six months before  Têtes Rondes et Cavalieres  Roundheads and Cavaliers   written by Jacques François Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine  which some sources state was based on Walter Scott s novel Old Mortality  while others state that there is no connection  The composer had prepared the way for his librettist by providing him with a scenario of thirty nine scenes  thus compressing the original drama into manageable proportions   reducing the number of characters from nine to seven and at the same time  giving them names of a more Italianate  singable quality   Continuing to work on the yet unnamed I Puritani  Bellini moved to Puteaux— a half an hour by road  from central Paris  as the guest of an English friend  Samuel Levys   where I hope to complete my opera more carefully   At some in the late Spring  specific date unknown  Bellini wrote to Pepoli to remind him that he should bring the first act of the opera with him the following day  so that we can finish discussing the first act  which   will be interesting  magnificent  and proper poetry for music in spite of you and all your absurd rules     At the same time  he lays out one basic rule for the librettist to follow   By late June  there had been considerable progress and  in a letter copied into one written to Florimo on 25 July  Bellini writes in reply to Alesandro Lanari  now the director of the Royal Theatres of Naples  Because Lanari had written to him on 10 April 1834 regarding an opera for Naples  Bellini tells him that the first act of Puritani is finished and that he expects to complete the opera by September  in order that he may then have time to write for Naples   In this letter to Lanari  the composer lays down some very strict terms  some of which received counter offers in August  but none of which were accepted by the composer  Finally  Bellini stated that he did not want  to negotiate with anybody until I see what success my opera will have   This included a proposal from the Opéra Comique for a new opera for them   By September he was writing to Florimo of being able to  polish and re polish  in the three remaining months before rehearsals and he expresses happiness with Pepoli s verses   a very beautiful trio for the two basses and La Grisi  and by around mid December he had submitted the score for Rossini s approval  with rehearsals planned for late December early January  The dress rehearsal on 20 January 1835 was attended by many people— All of high society  all the great artists  and everyone most distinguished in Paris were in the theatre  enthusiastic  —and the premiere  postponed by two days  took place on 24 January 1835  Bellini s ecstatic letter to Florimo which followed recounts the enthusiastic reception of many of the numbers throughout the performance  most especially the second act stretta so that  by its end   The opera became  the rage of Paris  and was given 17 performances to end the season on 31 March   7  Paris  January to September 1835  In the immediate aftermath of I puritani  s success  Bellini was awarded two honours  the first by King Louis Philippe  naming him as chevalier of the Légion d honneur  the second by King Ferdinand II in Naples  awarding him the cross of the  Order of Francesco I   Bellini then dedicated I puritiani  To the Queen of the French   Queen Marie Emélie  But from a personal point of view  Bellini expressed his sadness at not having seen Florimo for so long  and there flowed a succession of invitations  then demands that Florimo come to Paris to visit him  but from February to July  Florimo ignored the offers and finally  in a letter to him  Bellini stated   I ll no longer ask for reasons  and I ll see you when I see you   After that  he attempted to persuade his uncle  Vincenzo Ferlito  to visit  but without success   During the final preparations in 1834 for the staging of Puritani and up to its delay into 1835  Bellini had concluded an agreement with Naples to present three operas there—including the re writing of parts of the music for Malibran—beginning in the following January  All that went by the wayside when the revised score failed to arrive on time  and performances were abandoned and the contract scrapped  Thus  during March  Bellini did nothing  but did attend the final performance of Puritani on 31st  On 1 April  he wrote a very lengthy letter to Ferlito laying out the entire history of his life in Paris to date  as well as reviving the old jealousies about Donizetti and Rossini s so called  enmity  toward him  He ended by mentioning that  my future plans are to be able to arrange a contract with the French Grand Opéra and remain in Paris  making it my home for the present  Additionally  he discusses the prospect of marriage to a young woman who  is not rich  but she has an uncle and aunt who are  if they will give her 200 000 francs  I ll marry her   but remarks that he is in no hurry   Throughout May  accounts came to him from London of the success of I puritani and the failure of a revival of Norma  due to the poor performances by both the Adelgisa and Pollione   although later reports of Giulietta Grisi s Norma—in contrast to those of Pasta—were not good either  and Bellini was pleased that it was not Grisi who gave the opera in Paris  Over the summer  Bellini s general mood was reported to be  dark   discussion with the Opéra could not proceed until a new director was appointed   he writes long letters  crowded with projects  ideas  reveries that the hand seems to have trouble restraining   and  as Weintock concludes  all of these things seem to  inescapably suggest a man deeply disturbed physically  psychologically  or both    At one of the literary gatherings which Bellini attended earlier in the year  Bellini had met the writer Heinrich Heine  Both men then attended a dinner that summer  at which the writer is reported to have remarked maliciously   The rather superstitious Bellini was horrified  Also  when Heine s literary portrait of Bellini  which became part of his unfinished novel Florentinische Nächte  Florentine Nights  was published in 1837  it emphasized the less appealing aspects of the composer s personality  summing up a description of him as  a sigh in dancing pumps    From between mid August and early September  Bellini wrote his last known letter to Filippo Santocanale on 16 August  followed by one to Florimo on 2 September  In the latter  he mentions that  for three days I ve been slightly disturbed by a diarrhea  but I am better now  and think that it is over    7 1  Final illness and death  It was clear from Bellini s reaction to Heine s remarks  that he did not like him  Attempting to reconcile the two men  Madame Joubert  who had attended the summer event  invited both to dinner  along with her friend the Princess Belgioioso  Bellini failed to appear  instead he sent a note stating that he was too ill  Weinstock reports that the principessa sent Doctor Luigi Montallegri to Puteaux  Over a few days  he reported to Carlo Severini of the Théatre Italien with four notes  the first  on 20 September  stated  no appreciable improvement   On the following day  Montallegri reported a slight improvement  and on 22nd  the doctor stated that he  hopes to declare him out of danger tomorrow   However  the fourth note—on 22 September—is far more pessimistic  it reported that it was the thirteen day of the illness and that Bellini had  passed a very restless night   And then  during the daytime of the 23rd  Montallegri indicated what Weinstock describes as  a terrifying convulsion  and that death was close  It appears that Bellini died at around 5pm on 23 September 1835   Immediately taking charge of arrangements  Rossini began to plan Bellini s funeral and entombment  as well as caring for his estate  He ordered that a post mortem be performed  following an order which came directly from the King  The distinguished Court appointed Doctor Dalmas performed the autopsy and reported his findings on the cause of death   Rossini then created a committee of Parisian musicians in order to find support for a subscription to build a monument to the dead composer  as well as supporting a funeral mass to be given on 2 October in the chapel of the Hôtel des Invalides  On 27 September and 3 October  Rossini wrote to Santocanale in Palermo providing very detailed accounts of all that he had done immediately following Bellini s death and then what had taken place on 2 October  Initially  Rossini regarded burial in the Pere Lachaise cemetery as a short term arrangement  not knowing where the final resting place would turn out to be  Despite attempts over many years to have Bellini s remains transferred to Catania  that did not take place until 1876  when the casket containing his remains was taken to the cathedral in Catania and reburied   Of the many tributes which poured forth following Bellini s death  one stands out  It was written by Felice Romani and published in Turin on 1 October 1835  In it  he states   and he concludes   I sweated for fifteen years to find a Bellini  A single day took him from me    Today  the Museo Belliniano  housed in the Gravina Cruyllas Palace in Catania—Bellini s birthplace—preserves memorabilia and scores   8  Bellini  romanticism and melodrama  When planning the subject of his next opera after La Scala s Il pirata  Bellini had been invited to write an opera for Parma s inauguration of the new Teatro Ducale in early 1829  In the initial contract  Bellini was given power over who was to write the libretto and  after meeting the composer and prima donna  the Parman librettist Luigi Torrigiani s work had been rejected  The aspiring librettist laid a complaint against Bellini in a report to Parma s Grand Chamberlain in December 1828  which was ignored   In it  the aggrieved librettist sums up Bellini s tastes in Romantic drama as follows   In writing the libretto for Zaira  Romani expressed his position in relation to Voltaire s tragedy by noting in the preface to the libretto   9  Personal life and relationships  9 1  Francesco Florimo  Bellini resisted any emotional commitment  and never married  leading to speculation as to his sexuality  The central relationship in Bellini s life seemed to be with Francesco Florimo stemming from his student days at the Naples Conservatory  and who came from a village close to Catania  Over Bellini s lifetime  the two shared a close correspondence  the source of much of the information which is known to us about the composer s life via the  sometimes  very long letters which Bellini wrote to him from the many places in which he lived and to which he travelled  Meanwhile  Florimo remained in Naples  ultimately becoming the Conservatoire s librarian  The two men addressed each in very affectionate terms  Bellini wrote in 1825   Your existence is necessary to mine   However  once Bellini left Naples for Milan  they saw each other very infrequently  the last time being in Naples in late 1832 when Bellini was there with Giuditta Turina and before they left to return to Milan via Florence  Florimo s published recollections—from fifty years away from the events which they recall—may be flawed  In later years  Bellini declared that Florimo  was the only friend in whom  I  could find comfort   It is unclear whether the relationship was ever physical  After Bellini s death Florimo was treated as his spiritual heir  as well as his literary executor   9 2  Maddalena Fumarolis  Although the frustrating affair with Maddalena Fumarolis which  as noted above  came to nothing during these early years  the success achieved by Bianca e Gernado gave Bellini fresh hope that her parents would finally relent  and a new appeal was made through a friend  This was utterly rejected by Maddalena s father  who returned all the letters which she had received along with a letter from him stating that  my daughter will never marry a poor piano banger  suonatore di cembalo    However  when Florimo gave him the news  he said that he was going to try again and win  but the next move was to come later from the Fumarolis family   At some time before March 1828  after the major success of Il pirata and just as Bellini was about to leave Milan for his production of Bianca e Ferdinando in Genoa  he received a notification from his go between with the Fumarolis family that they had withdrawn their rejection of his proposal  But by then—with the efforts to build his career and with time and distance between him and Maddalena—his feelings had changed and  using Florimo to communicate to the family  he rejected the offer  expressing the feeling that he would be unable to support her financially  Even Maddalena s own pleas in three letters which followed failed to change his mind   9 3  Giuditta Turina  The one significant relationship which Bellini had after 1828 was the five year relationship with Giuditta Turina  a young married woman with whom he began a passionate affair when both were in Genoa in April 1828 for the production of Bianca e Fernando  Their relationship lasted until Bellini went to Paris  Perhaps because her marriage was irrevocable and not based on love  and because the lovers were discreet  her husband  Fernandino  and his family seem to have tacitly permitted the relationship  Bellini’s letters to his friend Florimo indicate his satisfaction with the nature of the liaison  particularly because it kept him from having to marry—and thus becoming being distracted from his work   However  in May 1833 while he was in London  a significant change in Bellini s relationship with Giuditta followed from the discovery by her husband of a compromising letter from Bellini  The result was that he decided to seek a legal separation and have her removed from his house  For Bellini  it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her  and he had no interest in doing that  having cooled in his feelings for her  When he wrote to Florimo from Paris the following year  he clearly stated that  I constantly am being threatened from Milan with Giuditta s coming to Paris   at which point he says he ll leave that city if that were to happen  Then he continues   I no longer want to be put in the position of renewing a relationship that made me suffer great troubles   Ultimately  he resisted any long term emotional commitment  and never married   However  Turina maintained contact with Florimo throughout her life  although was heard from her after his death until she wrote a sad but friendly letter to Florimo Florimo returned the friendship and  as Galatopoulos notes   the death of Bellini was a mutual loss and Florimo needed Giuditta as much as she needed him  so that the two corresponded for years and Florimo visited her in Milan  at least once  in 1858   She died on 1 December 1871   10  Complete works of Bellini  10 1  Operas  In 1999  the Italian music publisher Casa Ricordi  in collaboration with the Teatro Massimo
