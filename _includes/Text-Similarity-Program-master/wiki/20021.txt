Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other marine or brackish bodies of water  Given that in biology many phyla  families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land  marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy  Marine biology differs from marine ecology as marine ecology is focused on how organisms interact with each other and the environment  while biology is the study of the organisms themselves   A large proportion of all life on Earth exists in the ocean  Exactly how large the proportion is unknown  since many ocean species are still to be discovered  The ocean is a complex three dimensional world covering about 71% of the Earth s surface  The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere  to the depths of the oceanic trenches  sometimes 10 000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean  Specific habitats include coral reefs  kelp forests  seagrass meadows  the surrounds of seamounts and thermal vents  tidepools  muddy  sandy and rocky bottoms  and the open ocean  pelagic  zone  where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary  The organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton to huge cetaceans  whales  in length   Marine life is a vast resource  providing food  medicine  and raw materials  in addition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world  At a fundamental level  marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet  Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle  and are involved in the regulation of the Earth s climate  Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life  and some marine organisms even help create new land   Many species are economically important to humans  including food fish  both finfish and shellfish   It is also becoming understood that the well being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways  The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing  with new discoveries being made nearly every day  These cycles include those of matter  such as the carbon cycle  and of air  such as Earth s respiration  and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean   Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored   1  History  Early instances of the study of marine biology trace back to Aristotle  384–322 BC  who made several contributions which laid the foundation for many future discoveries and were the first big step in the early exploration period of the ocean and marine life  The British naturalist Edward Forbes  1815–1854  is regarded by some as the founder of the science of marine biology  The pace of oceanographic and marine biology studies quickly accelerated during the course of the 19th century   The observations made in the first studies of marine biology fuelled the age of discovery and exploration that followed  During this time  a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world  Many voyages contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge  Among the most significant were the voyages of the HMS Beagle where Charles Darwin came up with his theories of evolution and on the formation of coral reefs  Another important expedition was undertaken by HMS Challenger  where findings were made of unexpectedly high species diversity among fauna stimulating much theorizing by population ecologists on how such varieties of life could be maintained in what was thought to be such a hostile environment  This era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies because they lacked technology that would allow them to adequately examine species that lived in deep parts of the oceans   The creation of marine laboratories was important because it allowed marine biologists to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions  The oldest marine laboratory in the world  Station biologique de Roscoff  was established in France in 1872  In the United States  the Scripps Institution of Oceanography dates back to 1903  while the prominent Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute was founded in 1930  The development of technology such as sound navigation ranging  scuba diving gear  submersibles and remotely operated vehicles allowed marine biologists to discover and explore life in deep oceans that was once thought to not exist   2  Subfields  The marine ecosystem is large  and thus there are many sub fields of marine biology  Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups  such as phycology  invertebrate zoology and ichthyology   Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in sea water and the ocean in general  adaptation to a salty environment  and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life  A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life  and global warming and environmental issues  such as carbon dioxide displacement    Recent marine biotechnology has focused largely on marine biomolecules  especially proteins  that may have uses in medicine or engineering  Marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire biomimetic materials   2 1  Related fields  Marine biology is a branch of biology and is closely linked to oceanography  It also encompasses many ideas from ecology  Fisheries science and marine conservation can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology  as well as environmental studies   Marine Chemistry  Physical oceanography and Atmospheric sciences are closely related to this field   3  Animals  3 1  Birds  Birds adapted to living in the marine environment are often referred to as seabirds  Examples include albatross  penguins  gannets  and auks  Although they spend most of their lives in the ocean  species such as gulls can often be found thousands of miles inland   3 2  Fish  Fish anatomy includes a two chambered heart  operculum  swim bladder  scales  fins  lips  eyes and secretory cells that produce mucous  Fish breathe by extracting oxygen from water through their gills  Fins propel and stabilize the fish in the water  Many fish fall under two major categories   Elasmobranchii and Teleostei   A reported 32 700 species of fish have been described  as of December 2013   more than the combined total of all other vertebrates  About 60% of fish species are saltwater fish   3 3  Invertebrates  As on land  invertebrates make up a huge portion of all life in the sea  Invertebrate sea life includes Cnidaria such as jellyfish and sea anemones  Ctenophora  sea worms including the phyla Platyhelminthes  Nemertea  Annelida  Sipuncula  Echiura  Chaetognatha  and Phoronida  Mollusca including shellfish  squid  octopus  Arthropoda including Chelicerata and Crustacea  Porifera  Bryozoa  Echinodermata including starfish  and Urochordata including sea squirts or tunicates   3 4  Mammals  There are five main types of marine mammals   Cetaceans include toothed whales  Suborder Odontoceti   such as the Sperm Whale  dolphins  and porpoises such as the Dall s porpoise  Cetaceans also include baleen whales  Suborder Mysticeti   such as the Gray Whale  Humpback Whale  and Blue Whale   Sirenians include manatees  the Dugong  and the extinct Steller s Sea Cow   Seals  Family Phocidae   sea lions  Family Otariidae   which also include the fur seals   and the Walrus  Family Odobenidae  are all considered pinnipeds   The Sea Otter is a member of the Family Mustelidae  which includes weasels and badgers   The Polar Bear  Family Ursidae  is sometimes considered a marine mammal because of its dependence on the sea   3 5  Reptiles  Reptiles which inhabit or frequent the sea include sea turtles  sea snakes  terrapins  the marine iguana  and the saltwater crocodile  Most extant marine reptiles  except for some sea snakes  are oviparous and need to return to land to lay their eggs  Thus most species  excepting sea turtles  spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean  Despite their marine adaptations  most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land  around islands  especially waters that are somewhat sheltered  as well as near estuaries  Some extinct marine reptiles  such as ichthyosaurs  evolved to be viviparous and had no requirement to return to land   4  Fungi  Over 1500 species of fungi are known from marine environments  These parasitize marine algae or animals  or are saprobes on algae  corals  protozoan cysts  sea grasses  wood and other substrata  and can also be found in sea foam  Spores of many species have special appendages which facilitate attachment to the substratum  A very diverse range of unusual secondary metabolites is produced by marine fungi   5  Plants and algae  Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life  sometimes acting as hiding and foraging places for larval forms of larger fish and invertebrates   Algal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean  Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world s photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined  Most of the niche occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic algae in the ocean  such as Sargassum and kelp  which are commonly known as seaweeds that creates kelp forests   Plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters  such as the seagrasses  examples of which are eelgrass  Zostera  and turtle grass  Thalassia   These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment  The intertidal zone is also a good place to find plant life in the sea  where mangroves or cordgrass or beach grass might grow  Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life  sometimes acting as hiding and foraging places for larval forms of larger fish and invertebrates   6  Microscopic life  Microscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood  For example  the role of viruses in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century   The role of phytoplankton is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous primary producers on Earth  Phytoplankton are categorized into cyanobacteria  also called blue green algae bacteria   various types of algae  red  green  brown  and yellow green   diatoms  dinoflagellates  euglenoids  coccolithophorids  cryptomonads  chrysophytes  chlorophytes  prasinophytes  and silicoflagellates   Zooplankton tend to be somewhat larger  and not all are microscopic  Many Protozoa are zooplankton  including dinoflagellates  zooflagellates  foraminiferans  and radiolarians  Some of these  such as dinoflagellates  are also phytoplankton  the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms  Other zooplankton include cnidarians  ctenophores  chaetognaths  molluscs  arthropods  urochordates  and annelids such as polychaetes  Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms  Two examples are fish larvae and sea stars  also called starfish    7  Marine habitats  Marine habitats can be divided into coastal and open ocean habitats  Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the shoreline to the edge of the continental shelf  Most marine life is found in coastal habitats  even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area  Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf  Alternatively  marine habitats can be divided into pelagic and demersal habitats  Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open water column  away from the bottom of the ocean  Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean  An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism  as in pelagic fish  Similarly  an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism  as in demersal fish  Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral  depending on what ocean currents are doing   Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants  Some marine organisms  like corals  kelp and seagrasses  are ecosystem engineers which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms   7 1  Intertidal and shore  Intertidal zones  those areas close to shore  are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean s tides  A huge array of life lives within this zone   Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence  It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently  Many species here are scavengers  living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore  Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats  A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of bioerosion   7 2  Reefs  Reefs comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world  The best known types of reefs are tropical coral reefs which exist in most tropical waters  however  reefs can also exist in cold water  Reefs are built up by corals and other calcium depositing animals  usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor  Reefs can also grow on other surfaces  which has made it possible to create artificial reefs  Coral reefs also support a huge community of life  including the corals themselves  their symbiotic zooxanthellae  tropical fish and many other organisms   Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the El Niño weather phenomenon  In 1998  coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record  when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal  Some reefs are recovering  but scientists say that between 50% and 70% of the world s coral reefs are now endangered and predict that global warming could exacerbate this trend   7 3  Open ocean  The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients  yet because it is so vast  in total it produces the most primary productivity  Much of the aphotic zone s energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of detritus   7 4  Deep sea and trenches  The deepest recorded oceanic trench measured to date is the Mariana Trench  near the Philippines  in the Pacific Ocean at   At such depths  water pressure is extreme and there is no sunlight  but some life still exists  A white flatfish  a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the bathyscaphe Trieste when it dove to the bottom in 1960   Other notable oceanic trenches include Monterey Canyon  in the eastern Pacific  the Tonga Trench in the southwest at   the Philippine Trench  the Puerto Rico Trench at   the Romanche Trench at   Fram Basin in the Arctic Ocean at   the Java Trench at   and the South Sandwich Trench at    In general  the deep sea is considered to start at the aphotic zone  the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water  Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as bio luminescence   Marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths  where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed  Hydrothermal vents along the mid ocean ridge spreading centers act as oases  as do their opposites  cold seeps  Such places support unique biomes and many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations    8  Distribution factors  An active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the life cycles of various species and where they spend their time  Marine biologists study how the ocean currents  tides and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms  including their growth  distribution and well being  This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in GPS and newer underwater visual devices   Most ocean life breeds in specific places  nests or not in others  spends time as juveniles in still others  and in maturity in yet others  Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts of their life cycles  For example  it is still largely unknown where sea turtles and some sharks travel  Tracking devices do not work for some life forms  and the ocean is not friendly to technology  This is important to scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that by restricting commercial fishing in one small area they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area far away   9  See also
