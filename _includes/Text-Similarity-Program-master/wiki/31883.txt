In quantum mechanics  the uncertainty principle is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle known as complementary variables  such as position x and momentum p  can be known simultaneously  For instance  in 1927  Werner Heisenberg stated that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined  the less precisely its momentum can be known  and vice versa  The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928   ħ is the reduced Planck constant    Historically  the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics  called the observer effect  which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems  Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level  see below  as a physical  explanation  of quantum uncertainty  It has since become clear  however  that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave like systems  and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects  Thus  the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems  and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology  It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist observer takes part  but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer   Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics  typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it  Certain experiments  however  may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program  These include  for example  tests of number phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems  Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers   1  Introduction  As a principle  Heisenberg s uncertainty relationship must be something that is in accord with all experience  However  humans do not form an intuitive understanding of this indeterminacy in everyday life  so it may be helpful to demonstrate how it is integral to more easily understood physical situations  Two alternative conceptualizations of quantum physics can be examined with the goal of demonstrating the key role the uncertainty principle plays  A wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle provides for a more visually intuitive demonstration  and the somewhat more abstract matrix mechanics picture provides for a demonstration of the uncertainty principle that is more easily generalized to cover a multitude of physical contexts   Mathematically  in wave mechanics  the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding orthonormal bases in Hilbert space are Fourier transforms of one another  i e   position and momentum are conjugate variables   A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized  A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis  for example in sound waves  A pure tone is a sharp spike at a single frequency  while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain  which is a completely delocalized sine wave  In quantum mechanics  the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a matter wave  and momentum is its Fourier conjugate  assured by the de Broglie relation   where is the wavenumber   In matrix mechanics  the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics  any pair of non commuting self adjoint operators representing observables are subject to similar uncertainty limits  An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value  the eigenvalue   For example  if a measurement of an observable is performed  then the system is in a particular eigenstate of that observable  However  the particular eigenstate of the observable need not be an eigenstate of another observable   If so  then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it  as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable   1 1  Wave mechanics interpretation  According to the de Broglie hypothesis  every object in the universe is a wave  a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon  The position of the particle is described by a wave function   The time independent wave function of a single moded plane wave of wavenumber k0 or momentum p0 is  The Born rule states that this should be interpreted as a probability density function in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between a and b is  In the case of the single moded plane wave  is a uniform distribution  In other words  the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet  Consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves  however  we may write this as  where An represents the relative contribution of the mode pn to the overall total  The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves  the wave packet can become more localized  We may take this a step further to the continuum limit  where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes  with representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space  In mathematical terms  we say that is the Fourier transform of and that x and p are conjugate variables  Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost  namely the momentum has become less precise  having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta   One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the standard deviation σ  Since is a probability density function for position  we calculate its standard deviation   The precision of the position is improved  i e  reduced σx  by using many plane waves  thereby weakening the precision of the momentum  i e  increased σp  Another way of stating this is that σx and σp have an inverse relationship or are at least bounded from below  This is the uncertainty principle  the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound  Click the show button below to see a semi formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics   1 2  Matrix mechanics interpretation  In matrix mechanics  observables such as position and momentum are represented by self adjoint operators  When considering pairs of observables  an important quantity is the commutator  For a pair of operators and   one defines their commutator as  In the case of position and momentum  the commutator is the canonical commutation relation  The physical meaning of the non commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum eigenstates  Let be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue   By definition  this means that Applying the commutator to yields  where is the identity operator   Suppose  for the sake of proof by contradiction  that is also a right eigenstate of momentum  with constant eigenvalue   If this were true  then one could write  On the other hand  the above canonical commutation relation requires that  This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate   When a state is measured  it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable  For example  if a particle s position is measured  then the state amounts to a position eigenstate  This means that the state is not a momentum eigenstate  however  but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates  In other words  the momentum must be less precise  This precision may be quantified by the standard deviations   As in the wave mechanics interpretation above  one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two  quantified by the uncertainty principle   2  Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations  The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the Robertson uncertainty relation   For an arbitrary Hermitian operator we can associate a standard deviation  where the brackets indicate an expectation value  For a pair of operators and   we may define their commutator as  In this notation  the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by  The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately follows from a slightly stronger inequality  the Schrödinger uncertainty relation  where we have introduced the anticommutator   Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators  the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations  A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below   For position and linear momentum  the canonical commutation relation implies the Kennard inequality from above   For two orthogonal components of the total angular momentum operator of an object   In non relativistic mechanics  time is privileged as an independent variable  Nevertheless  in 1945  L  I  Mandelshtam and I  E  Tamm derived a non relativistic time energy uncertainty relation  as follows  For a quantum system in a non stationary state and an observable B represented by a self adjoint operator   the following formula holds   For the number of electrons in a superconductor and the phase of its Ginzburg–Landau order parameter  3  Examples  3 1  Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states  Consider a one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator  QHO   It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the creation and annihilation operators   Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO   the variances may be computed directly   The product of these standard deviations is then  In particular  the above Kennard bound is saturated for the ground state   for which the probability density is just the normal distribution   3 2  Quantum harmonic oscillator with Gaussian initial condition  In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω  place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement x0 as  where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω  Through integration over the propagator  we can solve for the  dependent solution  After many cancelations  the probability densities reduce to  where we have used the notation to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ2  Copying the variances above and applying trigonometric identities  we can write the product of the standard deviations as  From the relations  we can conclude  3 3  Coherent states  A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the annihilation operator   which may be represented in terms of Fock states as  In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO  the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances   Therefore every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound  with position and momentum each contributing an amount in a  balanced  way  Moreover every squeezed coherent state also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general   3 4  Particle in a box  Consider a particle in a one dimensional box of length   The eigenfunctions in position and momentum space are  and  where and we have used the de Broglie relation   The variances of and can be calculated explicitly   The product of the standard deviations is therefore  For all   the quantity is greater than 1  so the uncertainty principle is never violated  For numerical concreteness  the smallest value occurs when   in which case  3 5  Constant momentum  Assume a particle initially has a momentum space wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum p0 according to  where we have introduced a reference scale   with describing the width of the distribution−−cf  nondimensionalization  If the state is allowed to evolve in free space  then the time dependent momentum and position space wave functions are  Since and this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision  On the other hand  the standard deviation of the position is  such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as  4  Additional uncertainty relations  4 1  Mixed states  The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe mixed states   4 2  Phase space  In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics  the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star square function  Given a Wigner function with star product ★ and a function f  the following is generally true   Choosing   we arrive at  Since this positivity condition is true for all a  b  and c  it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive  The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the determinant   or  explicitly  after algebraic manipulation   4 3  Systematic error  The inequalities above focus on the statistical imprecision of observables as quantified by the standard deviation  Heisenberg s original version  however  was interested in systematic error  incurred by a disturbance of a quantum system by the measuring apparatus  i e   an observer effect  If we let represent the error  i e   accuracy  of a measurement of an observable and represent its disturbance by the measurement process  then the following inequality holds  In fact  Heisenberg s uncertainty principle as originally described in the 1927 formulation mentions only the first term  Applying the notation above to Heisenberg s position momentum relation  Heisenberg s argument could be rewritten as  Such a formulation is both mathematically incorrect and experimentally refuted  It is also possible to derive a similar uncertainty relation combining both the statistical and systematic error components   4 4  Entropic uncertainty principle  For many distributions  the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure  For example  uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period  Other examples include highly bimodal distributions  or unimodal distributions with divergent variance   A solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on entropic uncertainty instead of the product of variances  While formulating the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in 1957  Hugh Everett III conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty  This conjecture  also studied by Hirschman and proven in 1975 by Beckner and by Iwo Bialynicki Birula and Jerzy Mycielski is  where we have used the Shannon entropy  not the quantum von Neumann entropy   for some arbitrary fixed length scale    From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalites   equivalently  from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance   it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is stronger than the one based on standard deviations  because  A few remarks on these inequalities  First  the choice of base e is a matter of popular convention in physics  The logarithm can alternatively be in any base  provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality  Second  the numerical value on the right hand side assumes the unitary convention of the Fourier transform  used throughout physics and elsewhere in this article  Third  the normal distribution saturates the inequality  and it is the only distribution with this property  because it is the maximum entropy probability distribution among those with fixed variance  cf  here for proof    5  Harmonic analysis  In the context of harmonic analysis  a branch of mathematics  the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its Fourier transform  To wit  the following inequality holds   Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities  including the above entropic uncertainty  hold between a function and its Fourier transform    5 1  Signal processing  In the context of signal processing  and in particular time–frequency analysis  uncertainty principles are referred to as the Gabor limit  after Dennis Gabor  or sometimes the Heisenberg–Gabor limit  The basic result  which follows from  Benedicks s theorem   below  is that a function cannot be both time limited and band limited  a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain —see bandlimited versus timelimited   Stated alternatively   One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal  function   in both the time domain and frequency domain    its Fourier transform     When applied to filters  the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time  a concrete example are the resolution issues of the short time Fourier transform—if one uses a wide window  one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution  while a narrow window has the opposite trade off   Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results  and  in time–frequency analysis  rather than interpreting the  1 dimensional  time and frequency domains separately  one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the  2 dimensional  time–frequency plane  In practice  the Gabor limit limits the simultaneous time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference  it is possible to achieve higher resolution  but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other   5 2  Benedicks s theorem  Amrein Berthier and Benedicks s theorem intuitively says that the set of points where is non zero and the set of points where is nonzero cannot both be small   Specifically  it is impossible for a function in and its Fourier transform to both be supported on sets of finite Lebesgue measure  A more quantitative version is  One expects that the factor may be replaced by   which is only known if either or is convex   5 3  Hardy s uncertainty principle  The mathematician G  H  Hardy formulated the following uncertainty principle  it is not possible for and to both be  very rapidly decreasing   Specifically  if in is such that  and  then  if   while if   then there is a polynomial of degree such that  This was later improved as follows  if is such that  then  where is a polynomial of degree and is a real positive definite matrix   This result was stated in Beurling s complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander  the case   and Bonami  Demange  and Jaming for the general case  Note that Hörmander–Beurling s version implies the case in Hardy s Theorem while the version by Bonami–Demange–Jaming covers the full strength of Hardy s Theorem  A different proof of Beurling s theorem based on Liouville s theorem appeared in Hedenmalm   A full description of the case as well as the following extension to Schwarz class distributions appears in Demange   Theorem  If a tempered distribution is such that  and  then  for some convenient polynomial and real positive definite matrix of type    6  History  Werner Heisenberg formulated the Uncertainty Principle at Niels Bohr s institute in Copenhagen  while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics  In 1925  following pioneering work with Hendrik Kramers  Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics  which replaced the ad hoc old quantum theory with modern quantum mechanics  The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level  as electrons in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits  Rather  their motion is smeared out in a strange way  the Fourier transform of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation   Heisenberg s paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time  he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion  Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies  they could not be used to construct an exact trajectory  so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going   In March 1926  working in Bohr s institute  Heisenberg realized that the non commutativity implies the uncertainty principle  This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non commutativity  and it laid the foundation for what became known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics  Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty  or in Bohr s language a complementarity  Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known  the less precisely the other can be known  Heisenberg wrote   It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows  One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity  It is impossible to determine accurately both the position and the direction and speed of a particle at the same instant  In his celebrated 1927 paper   Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik    On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics    Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement  but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp  Instead  he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately  In his Chicago lecture he refined his principle   Kennard in 1927 first proved the modern inequality   where ħ   h 2π  and σx  σp are the standard deviations of position and momentum  Heisenberg only proved relation  2  for the special case of Gaussian states   6 1  Terminology and translation  Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper  written in German  Heisenberg used the word   Ungenauigkeit    indeterminacy    to describe the basic theoretical principle  Only in the endnote did he switch to the word   Unsicherheit    uncertainty    When the English language version of Heisenberg s textbook  The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory  was published in 1930  however  the translation  uncertainty  was used  and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter   6 2  Heisenberg s microscope  The principle is quite counter intuitive  so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable  One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by using an imaginary microscope as a measuring device   He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an electron by shooting a photon at it   The combination of these trade offs imply that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used  the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit  which is  up to a small numerical factor  equal to Planck s constant  Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit  which is elaborated below   and preferred to use it instead  as a heuristic quantitative statement  correct up to small numerical factors  which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable   7  Critical reactions  The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg s Uncertainty Principle were  in fact  seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying determinism and realism  According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics  there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes  just a prescription for calculating experimental results  There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is  only what the result of observations might be   Albert Einstein believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality  while Niels Bohr believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible  and depend on which measurements we choose to perform  Einstein and Bohr debated the uncertainty principle for many years  Some experiments within the first decade of the twenty first century have cast doubt on how extensively the uncertainty principle applies   7 1  Einstein s slit  The first of Einstein s thought experiments challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows   Bohr s response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well  and that to measure the recoil to accuracy   the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through  This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to   and if the wall s momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil  the slit s position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement   A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by Richard Feynman   In another thought experiment Lawrence Marq Goldberg theorized that one could  for example  determine the position of a particle and then travel back in time to a point before the first reading to measure the velocity  then time travel back to a point before the second  earlier  reading was taken to deliver the resulting measurements before the particle was disturbed so that the measurements did not need to be taken  This  of course  would result in a temporal paradox  But it does support his contention that  the problems inherent to the uncertainly principle lay in the measuring not in the  uncertainty  of physics    7 2  Einstein s box  Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as Einstein s box  Einstein argued that  Heisenberg s uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy  the product of the two being related to Planck s constant   Consider  he said  an ideal box  lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely  The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape   We now know  explained Einstein  precisely the time at which the photon left the box    Now  weigh the box again  The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light  In this manner  said Einstein  one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision  in contradiction to the uncertainty principle    Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument  and eventually realized that it was flawed  He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed  say by a spring and a pointer on a scale   since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight  there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table      Furthermore  the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth s surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock   because of Einstein s own theory of gravity s effect on time   Through this chain of uncertainties  Bohr showed that Einstein s light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape    7 3  EPR paradox for entangled particles  Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein  In 1935  Einstein  Podolsky and Rosen  see EPR paradox  published an analysis of widely separated entangled particles  Measuring one particle  Einstein realized  would alter the probability distribution of the other  yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed  This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle  concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction   But Einstein came to much more far reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment  He believed the  natural basic assumption  that a complete description of reality  would have to predict the results of experiments from  locally changing deterministic quantities   and therefore  would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle   In 1964  John Bell showed that this assumption can be falsified  since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments  Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics  ruling out Einstein s basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his hidden variables  Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting Karl Popper s philosophy of invalidation of a theory by falsification experiments  That is to say  here Einstein s  basic assumption  became falsified by experiments based on Bell s inequalities  For the objections of Karl Popper against the Heisenberg inequality itself  see below   While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal  hidden variables  and in fact David Bohm invented such a formulation  this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists  The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical  and it can be potentially intractable  If the hidden variables are not constrained  they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes  To make it sensible  the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the size of the observable universe puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do  A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10 000 digits or more  a potentially achievable task in quantum mechanics   7 4  Popper s criticism  Karl Popper approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and metaphysical realist  He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to ensembles of identically prepared particles  referring to them as  statistical scatter relations   In this statistical interpretation  a particular measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory  This directly contrasts with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics  which is non deterministic but lacks local hidden variables   In 1934  Popper published Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen  Critique of the Uncertainty Relations  in Naturwissenschaften  and in the same year Logik der Forschung  translated and updated by the author as The Logic of Scientific Discovery in 1959   outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation  In 1982  he further developed his theory in Quantum theory and the schism in Physics  writing    Heisenberg s  formulae are  beyond all doubt  derivable statistical formulae of the quantum theory  But they have been habitually misinterpreted by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the precision of our measurements  original emphasis  Popper proposed an experiment to falsify the uncertainty relations  although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with Weizsäcker  Heisenberg  and Einstein  this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the EPR experiment   7 5  Many worlds uncertainty  The many worlds interpretation originally outlined by Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between the Einstein and Bohr s views by replacing Bohr s wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation  Thus  uncertainty in the many worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes   7 6  Free will  Some scientists including Arthur Compton and Martin Heisenberg have suggested that the uncertainty principle  or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics  could be evidence for the two stage model of free will  The standard view  however  is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry  nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely  due to the rapid decoherence time of quantum systems at room temperature   8
