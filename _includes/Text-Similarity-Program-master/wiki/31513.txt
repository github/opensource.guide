The Champion of the Universe  Tryco Slatterus  is a fictional character  appearing in Marvel Comics universe  He is not necessarily a villain but has played the role in the past through his impetuous and arrogant actions   1  Publication history  He first appeared in Marvel Two in One Annual #7  1982   and was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Wilson   2  Fictional character biography  The Champion is one of the alien Elders of the Universe  He is an immortal who claims to have been born billions of years ago  in the Ancrindo Nebula  in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds  Although he wishes to prove himself the greatest warrior in the universe  he usually does so fairly  He keeps himself busy by fighting powerful warriors throughout the universe  The Champion of the Universe s Promoter Supreme  named Proja  preceded the Champion s journey to Earth and recruited eight of Earth s strongest male heroes  Champion having decided eons earlier that females were inferior and not worth fighting   Champion then forced their participation by threatening to destroy the planet should they not fight him   those unworthy of the glorious gift that is the true spirit of competition would be  purified   The Champion challenged the superheroes Thing  Namor  Hulk  Colossus  Sasquatch  Thor  Doc Samson  and Wonder Man to a boxing match in Madison Square Garden while a forcefield is around it and brought them to his extra dimensional training facility to prepare for the match  The Champion ended up disqualifying Namor  for refusing to stoop to training   and Doc Samson  for not being sufficiently skilled to qualify as an opponent   When it came to the day of the boxing match  Thor was disqualified for throwing his hammer  he was allowed to use it since he was powerless without it   Hulk was disqualified because the Champion refused to  soil his hands on a mindless animal   Wonder Man was disqualified for tearing up the ring after being battered badly in the first round  Sasquatch was knocked out in the first round  and Colossus was defeated by technical knockout in the first round when he was unable to continue fighting  Alone of all of Earth s superheroes not previously disqualified  Thing managed to put up a semblance of fight against the Champion and lasted longer than any previous opponent the Champion had fought  Of all the opponents the Champion ever faced  only Thing lasted more than two rounds  Although the Champion fought Thing and ultimately defeated him with ease  Thing would not surrender  as he was convinced that the entire planet was in danger  Thing believed that everyone depended on him  and fought on despite broken bones and getting knocked out of the ring  Thing astonished the Champion with his resilience and courage leading the Champion to say Thing was the opponent he had sought through the ages  the one who would require all of his might and skill  His jaw broken and severely beaten after collapsing at the end of the third round  Thing crawled across the ring to demand the fight continue when the Champion claimed victory  When forced to choose between killing his defeated opponent or yielding  the Champion yielded  When Thing said he was  just too stupid and ugly to give up   the Champion replied he could never defeat Thing  He might break his bones and his body  but he could not break his spirit  Any planet which could produce a champion such as the Thing  he said  was a truly worthy world   The Champion attempted to kill the Silver Surfer to prevent him from interfering with a Skrull plot to use Nova to force Galactus to destroy the Kree Empire  The Champion was overpowered by the Silver Surfer  suffering his first known defeat in combat  however it is notable the Surfer used the Power Cosmic to blast the Champion rather than engage him physically   The Champion was one of the eleven Elders who sought to restart the universe by killing Galactus  He attempted to kill Mantis but she was rescued by the Silver Surfer  The Champion then battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus  The Champion and the other four Elders devoured by Galactus caused Galactus  cosmic indigestion  from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos  When asked to aid the Silver Surfer and Nova in helping Galactus to defeat the In Betweener the Champion was one of the four Elders who agreed and he physically restrained the Grandmaster to prevent him from opposing them  Once the In Betweener had been defeated by Galactus the five Elders used their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance  As a result  the Champion ended up with the Power Gem  one of the Infinity Gems  in his possession  Thanos eventually tracked the Champion down to the planet Tamarata  and tricked the Champion into causing a seismic disruption that destroyed Tamarata  forcing him to forfeit his Infinity Gem for transport to another planet  However  instead of helping the Champion after receiving the Gem  Thanos caused the Champion to fall to another world   Much later  once more in possession of the Power Gem  the Champion had settled on the planet Skardon  whose native Skard exist in a  might makes right  culture  all disputes  including matters of law  are settled in a trial by combat  with the winner of the fight thus becoming the winner of the dispute  By defeating Skardon s most powerful fighters in the natives  boxing ring esque arena  the Champion became the ruler of the planet  He then deliberately let the living conditions deteriorate on Skardon  and let it be known that he would continue to do so until a  worthy challenger  defeated and dethroned him  Adam Warlock responded to this challenge  and defeated the Champion with a  karmic blast  from another Infinity Gem  the Soul Gem  but made the mistake of doing so outside the ring and without engaging in hand to hand combat  thus  it was not a  legal  defeat in the eyes of the Skard  and the Champion maintained his position as ruler  Adam Warlock and his former Infinity Watch allies Gamora and Pip the Troll then recruited cosmically powerful beings from across the universe  intending to dethrone the Champion in the ring according to Skardon law  but the Champion managed to defeat all comers  including Drax the Destroyer  Gladiator  Beta Ray Bill  the Silver Surfer  and Adam Warlock himself  The Champion was ultimately unseated by the She Hulk  who was sent to Skardon as a representative of the universal judiciary body known as the Magistrati  at Pip s request  After initially fighting the Champion to her near defeat  She Hulk used her experience as a lawyer as well as her physical power to her advantage  asking for and receiving an  appeal  to the trial by combat  set for three months later  Upon discovering that Skardon law prohibits the use of weaponry or other foreign objects in the arena of legal dispute  she requested that the Champion face her in a rematch without using the Power Gem  With the Champion limited to his own power  without an omnipotent external power source  and the She Hulk having trained to increase both her strength and combat skills in the time between her first trial and the appeal  the Champion was swiftly dealt his first known defeat inside the ring  He also forfeited the use of the Power Gem  having made a bet with the She Hulk in which he agreed to never use the Gem again if she defeated him   After falling to the She Hulk  the Champion took the new name of  The Fallen One  in disgrace  He also attempted to take revenge through a proxy  passing the Power Gem to the heroine s arch enemy Titania  who also failed to defeat the She Hulk   Upon learning that the Champion can return the Power Gem that contains the  Power Primordial  to himself at anytime  Titania smashed him with a giant rock mass  believing that he would be kept buried below it   When the Deadpool Corps was chosen to go defeat The Awareness  Champion deemed them unworthy and sought to challenge them  However he is tricked and left stranded on an empty planet after the Deadpool Corps steals his motorcycle  After being rescued by the Gardener  Champion tracks down Deadpool at a bar and begins to fight  but is eventually convinced to join the team under the name  Championpool   He is soon tricked into going to fight on another deserted planet  only to find that there are no warriors to fight and his rocket cycle is without fuel  leaving him stranded   The Champion of the Universe was with the other Elders of the Universe during Thanos  meeting with them  Thanos caused the supposed deaths of those present   3  Powers and abilities  The Champion controls an energy source referred to as the Power Primordial  This energy is apparently residual energy that is left over from the Big Bang itself  The Champion has channeled this energy force into the perfection of his physical form  but in doing so  he has rendered himself unable to channel the energy into force blasts  unlike several other Elders   The Champion possesses vast physical strength  that is only limited by the amount of cosmic force that his body can contain  The Thing noted that the Champion hit him harder than either the Hulk or the Silver Surfer  without wearing the Power Gem at the time   This could be as much an issue of speed and technique  as Champion would likely have honed punching efficiency more than those two  and his fist is smaller than Hulk s so any force would be more focused    When Reed Richards measured the residual power levels left behind when Champion abducted Thing  he declared that the Champion was on a higher level than Galactus  This does not likely represent Galactus  maximum power levels though  as Reed s measurements would have been based on Galactus  strength in one of their six previous meetings  during several of which  Galactus was extremely weakened from hunger   The Champion s body does not tire from physical exertion  since his musculature generates no lactic acids and  as the Power Primordial sustains him  he is not limited by the need for food  drink  or sleep  and is virtually immune to aging  diseases and infections  He can exist unprotected in the vacuum of space indefinitely  He is extremely resistant against all forms of conventional injury  and in addition Death has barred the Elders from entering its realm  literally making the Champion immortal  However  this does not make him immune to damage  The Champion s ribs have been broken by the Thing  and he has been beaten unconscious by the She Hulk  partially due to surprise and his long standing lack of esteem for women  when she had trained herself to what was stated as near Hulk level strength   or the power cosmic of the Silver Surfer   The Champion is a master hand to hand combatant in a wide range of thousands of different martial arts and fighting styles taken from locations across the Universe  but tends to prefer boxing   While possessing the Infinity Gem of Power  the Champion unconsciously used it to further increase his power with his rage  so that during his fight with Thanos his strength increased to the point where he destroyed the planet on which they were fighting with a single punch  While wielding the Gem of Power as a good luck charm  Champion was able to manipulate entire battlefields for his amusement  He could withstand direct  point blank and consistent shots of Thanos s energy beams at full power  Thanos noted that the Champion s rampage was one of the only forces that could cause his personal force field to buckle and disengage   4  Characteristics  The Champion is a thoroughly ruthless and cold blooded individual ever searching for the thrill of battle  When first introduced he was more than willing to annihilate the entire population on Earth unless a fighter would defeat him limited to boxing rules  However he relented when impressed by the Thing s ability to give him a challenge  breaking his ribs   and relentless spirit to never give up  and spared the Earth and declared the bout a draw rather than kill his opponent  When collaborating with the other Elders he schemed to destroy the Universe to be reborn as new versions of Galactus  In the miniseries  Thanos Quest  he killed off an entire planetary population of soldiers just for sport  Later he assumed leadership of another planet and indifferently set the population to civil war  to provoke worthy challengers into seeking him out to put a stop to it  He is a strong chauvinist  and does not consider women as opponents worthy of him  only  appreciating  their value as courtesans or breeding stock   The Power Primordial sustains the Elders through their very desire and will to continue in pursuing their various interests  The Champion s interests  of course  being fighting  training to fight  and seeking opponents to fight  If the Champion were to grow uninterested in his pursuits and chose not to continue them  he could potentially die as a result  although since Death decreed no Elder could ever enter its realm  this may no longer be true   Although several billion years old  the Champion is not as intelligent as most other known Elders of the Universe  partially because most have chosen to develop their minds along with their physical bodies  Regardless  he has some familiarity with advanced alien technologies that surpass the understanding of most Earthlings  and has been shown as a crafty strategist when not blinded by rage   5  References  6  External links  at Comic Vine  at Marvel com  at Marvel Directory  at Marvel Wiki
