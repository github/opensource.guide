Viz is a popular British comic magazine founded in 1979 by Chris Donald  It parodies British comics of the post war period  notably The Beano and The Dandy  but with vulgar language  toilet humour  black comedy  surreal humour and generally sexual or violent storylines  It also sends up tabloid newspapers  with mockeries of articles and letters pages  It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced  limited edition  tat  as well as obsessions with half forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960 80s  such as Shakin  Stevens and Rodney Bewes  Occasionally  it satirises current events and politicians  but has no particular political standpoint   Its success in the early 1990s led to the appearance of numerous rivals crudely copying the format Viz pioneered  none of them has managed seriously to challenge its popularity  It once enjoyed being the third most popular magazine in the UK  but ABC audited sales have since dropped  to an average of 57 155 per issue in 2012  from 1 2 million    1  History  The comic was started in Newcastle upon Tyne in December 1979 by Chris Donald  who produced the comic from his bedroom in his parents  Jesmond home with help from his brother Simon and friend Jim Brownlow  Editor Chris Donald himself cannot remember exactly where the name of the magazine comes from  The most he can remember is  at the time  he needed to come up with a proper name for it  and he considered the word  Viz  a very easy word to write remember  as it consisted of three letters which are easily made with straight lines   It came about at around the time  and in the spirit of  the punk fanzines  and used alternative methods of distribution  such as the prominent DIY record label and shop Falling A Records  which was an early champion of the comic  The first 12 page issue was produced as a fanzine for a local record label  Anti Pop records  run by Arthur 2 Stroke and Andy  Pop  Inman  and went on sale for 20p  30p to students  in The Gosforth Hotel Salters road  which hosted  Anti Pop  punk gigs  and the run of 150 copies had sold out within hours  What had begun as a few pages  photocopied and sold to friends  became a publishing phenomenon  To meet the demand  and to make up for Brownlow s diminishing interest in contributing  freelance artist Graham Dury was hired and worked alongside Chris Donald   After a few years of steady sales  mostly in the North East of England  circulation had grown to around 5 000  As the magazine s popularity grew  the bedroom became too small and production moved to a nearby Jesmond office  Donald also hired another freelance artist  Simon Thorp  whose work had impressed him  For over a decade  these four would be the nucleus of Viz  In 1985  a deal was signed with Virgin Books to publish the comic nationally every two months  In 1987  the Virgin director responsible for Viz  John Brown  set up his own publishing company  John Brown Publishing  to handle Viz  Sales exceeded a million by the end of 1989  making Viz for a time one of the biggest selling magazines in the country  Inevitably  a number of imitations of Viz were launched  but these never matched the original in popularity  and rarely in quality   Sales steadily declined from the mid 1990s to around 200 000 in 2001  by which time Chris Donald had resigned as editor and passed control to an  editorial cabinet  comprising his brother  Simon  Dury  Thorp and new recruits Davey Jones and Alex Collier  In June 2001  the comic was acquired as part of a £6 4 million deal by I Feel Good  IFG   a company belonging to ex Loaded editor James Brown  and increased in frequency to ten times a year  In 2003  it changed hands again when IFG were bought out by Dennis Publishing  Soon after  Simon Donald quit his role as co editor  in an attempt to develop a career in television   Much of the non cartoon material such as the newspaper spoofs are written by the editorial team – Graham Dury  Simon Thorp and Davey Jones – with contributions from Robin Halstead  Jason Hazeley  Joel Morris and Alex Morris  the authors of The Framley Examiner  and by James MacDougall and Christina Martin   2  Notable strips  Many Viz characters have featured in long running strips  becoming well known in their own right  including spin off cartoons  Characters often have rhyming or humorous taglines  such as Roger Mellie  the Man on the Telly  Nobby s Piles  Johnny Fartpants  Buster Gonad  Sid the Sexist  Sweary Mary or Finbarr Saunders and his Double Entendres  Others are based on stereotypes of British culture  mostly via working class characters  such as Biffa Bacon  Cockney Wanker and The Fat Slags  In addition to this  the comic also contains plenty of  in jokes  referring to people and places in and around Newcastle upon Tyne   Many strips appear only once  These very often have extremely surreal or bizarre storylines  and often feature celebrities  For example   Paul Daniels s Jet Ski Journey to the Centre of Elvis   and  Arse Farm – Young Pete and Jenny Nostradamus were spending the holidays with their Uncle Jed  who farmed arses deep in the heart of the Sussex countryside      The latter type often follows the style of Enid Blyton and other popular children s adventure stories of the 1950s  Several strips were single panel  one off puns  such as  Daft Bugger   which featured two bored  uninterested men engaged in the act of buggery  the buggerer then states that he has forgotten his car keys  thus making him  daft     The one off strips often have ludicrously alliterative and or rhyming titles  for example   Reverend Milo s Lino Rhino    Max s Laxative Saxophone Taxi   and  Scottie Trotter s Tottie Alottment   Some strips are built entirely around absurd puns  such as  Noah s Arse  and  Feet and Two Reg    Most of the stories take place in the fictitious town of Fulchester  Fulchester was originally the setting of the British TV programme Crown Court before the name was adopted by the Viz team  Billy the Fish plays for Fulchester United F C  There is innuendo in the name  the Internet domain fuck co uk was at one time held by fans of Viz who claimed to be promoting the Fulchester Underwater Canoeing Klubb  A significant number of strips  most of which centre on child characters  are set in the fictional Barnton   One of the most pun based strips was  George Bestial   which centred on famous footballer George Best committing bestiality  The strip was discontinued after the death of Best  but has since reappeared   Viz also lampoons political ideas – both left wing ideals  in strips such as  The Modern Parents   and to an extent in  Student Grant    and right wing ones such as  Baxter Basics    Major Misunderstanding    Victorian Dad  and numerous strips involving tabloid columnists Garry Bushell   Garry Bushell the Bear   and Richard Littlejohn   Richard Littlecock  and  Robin Hood and Richard Littlejohn    portraying them as obsessed with homosexuality  political correctness and non existent left wing conspiracies to the exclusion of all else  Holocaust denier David Irving featured as Dick Dastardly in the Wacky Races spoof   Wacky Racists    In keeping with the comic s irreverent and deliberately non conformist style  the Duke of Edinburgh was once portrayed as a culturally insensitive  dim witted xenophobe in a one off strip  HRH The Duke of Edinburgh and his Jocular Larks  which centred on the Duke making outrageously ill informed comments to a young Chinese victim of a residential housing block collapse   Occasionally  celebrities get the  honour  of strips all to themselves  Billy Connolly has had more than one devoted to him trying to ingratiate himself with the Queen  Harold Shipman and Fred West got their own strip as rival neighbours trying to kill the old woman next door and trying to foil each other s plans  Harold and Fred – they make ladies dead    and Bob Hope had a strip of him trying to think up amusing last words to utter on his deathbed  but ended up with just a load of swearing   The singer Elton John has also appeared frequently in recent issues as a double dealing Del Boy type character attempting to pull off small time criminal scams such as tobacco smuggling  benefit fraud and cheating on fruit machines  Most recently  he was seen posing as a window cleaner and conning customers to pay him  before being mistaken for a Peeping Tom and given a thorough hiding  The strips always end with Elton being beaten at his own game by one or more of his musical contemporaries from the 1970s and 1980s  Other celebs to have been featured in their own strips include Jonathan Ross  Russell Brand  Esther Rantzen  Stephen Fry  Noel Edmonds  Jimmy Savile  as the headmaster of  Pop School   as  Sir Jimmy Savile  the Owl  and in  Jimmy Savile s Haunted Head    Johnny Vaughan  Adam Ant  Jimmy Hill  Noddy Holder  Boy George  Freddie Garrity  Steve McFadden  Morrissey  constantly finding daffodils stuck into the seat of his trousers  parodying his appearances on Top of the Pops   Busted  Eminem  Big Daddy  Danny Baker and plenty more   In 2002  British comedian Johnny Vegas sold the exclusive rights to his wedding photographs to Viz for £1  in a flippant dig at celebrity couples who sold the rights to their wedding photos to glossy magazines such as OK  for anything up to  and over  £1 million   3  Other content  3 1  Spoof news stories  The comic also prints regular satirical pastiches of typical tabloid and local media news stories  One issue featured a small write up of a wedding  However  in true Viz style  the wedding featured a lecherous groom marrying his pregnant  and significantly underaged  girlfriend  eyeing up her younger sister while being called a  cradle snatching cunt  by her father  with the resulting fight prompting the bride s mother to cry out  less it  for fuck s sake  before the police arrived   Another such story revolved around a man who won an inconsequential amount of money on the pools  and began living an inordinately lavish lifestyle   I bought the wife a new cover for her ironing board  being one such example of his largesse   which collapsed when the money inevitably ran out  much to his chagrin   I wish I d never set eyes on the money     Other stories include ludicrous  kiss and tell  and similar stories by people who are portrayed as mentally disturbed  often with highly bizarre elements  examples include allegations by a man who claimed that  on holiday touring in his caravan  he found a campsite run by Elvis Presley who  when plied with drink  admitted to the Kennedy assassination  another from a retired toilet attendant who described the nature of faeces from various little known celebrities and an elderly woman who blames anti social behaviour in her area on bored Newsnight presenters  as well as a mental home patient who claimed to have had sex with a number of children s TV puppets   Additionally  there were the usual stories revolving around celebrities  some in the  tell all  vein  such as a customs agent who claimed he found drugs in Pamela Anderson s  plastic tits    If one of a select band of frequently referenced stars is mentioned during these stories  they will be named humorously  Among others  Lemmy Kilmister will invariably be referred to as  Lemmy out of Motörhead   Bono as  Bonio  and Sting as  Sting  real name Gordon Sting    mixing the singer s birth and stage names  One particularly memorable piece of tabloidesque worldplay parody  involving a fictional plot to assassinate Paul McCartney by a disgruntled former roadie  read  Top Pop Mop Top Pot Shot Plot Flops   or with a gonad focussed violent encounter with Mr T and a 1970s playground toy   BA Baracus in Macca s clackers knackers fracas    Photos in Viz news stories are often edited and altered  much to the detriment of the subjects involved  teeth blacked out  facial features shrunken enlarged  and so on   In the case of the aforementioned Lemmy  for one photo the editors simply took a picture of a man wearing a baseball cap and drew a crude approximation of Lemmy s facial hair and warts on his face  as well as writing  Motörhead  on the cap   Photos will frequently be captioned only with the name of the subject and a comma followed by  yesterday   e g   A train  yesterday    Following the format common in tabloid newspapers  paragraphs within written articles include  cross heads  which  in normal journalism  serve to indicate the theme of the following sections  In Viz however  while these words often start out being relevant to the story  they quickly stray for comedic value and therefore have little or no relevance to the following text  The words will often follow a theme  such as TV cops  names or types of curry  and will sometimes spell out a sentence  rarely relevant  if read separately from the story   Rock pop stars Bono  Sting and Morrissey are regular targets of Viz humour  and their readership    3 2  Letterbocks  This section features letters both written by the editors and sent in by readers often with ridiculous names  usually in the form of obviously fictitious anecdotes  one reader claimed that by defecating on the high seas  he was able to expel a single unbroken  monster  turd  however  nobody wanted to grant him research funds for further attempts  or various observations  such as the  children say the funniest things  type  one issue featured numerous variations of a reader s young son making a reference to masturbation during bathtime  such as  playing with  his  pork sword   in this case  when the reader entered the bathroom  she discovered her son had indeed fashioned a sword out of pork sausages   Since Viz claims to offer £5 for the best letter published in a particular issue  many letters end with the inquiry   Do I win £5    Many make observations about celebrities  especially those who have recently died  one letter printed after the deaths of Gianni Versace and Princess Diana remarked on both their violent deaths and friendship with Elton John  stating  I tell you what  If I was George Michael right about now  I d be shitting myself   or current events  a 2000 issue remarked  The Government spent £850 million on the Millennium Bug  and the only thing that crashes is Q Desmond Llewelyn out of the Bond films     Most employ deliberate misunderstandings for comic effect  e g   These so called speed bumps are a joke  If anything they slow you down  or  I went to one of these so called Gentlemen s clubs and was shocked to see it was full of Women  To make matters worse many of them were wearing very little clothing    Often letters feature simple yet absurd statements   I m heading off to the pub in a few minutes and wondered if any of your readers fancied joining me for a pint  or  They say size doesn t matter – if that s true  why can t I get these shoes on      A bizarre series of letters from a J Cursiter of Bristol recounted his hobby of watching passers by from  a series of cunningly disguised hides   It is unclear whether Cursiter is a reader of the comic or a creation of the editors   Often letters are printed that criticise Viz  accusing it of  not being as funny as it used to be   condemning it as being offensive or of complaining about the frequent price rises  These are often published and sometimes even framed in a small section titled  Why I Love My Viz    blatantly mocking The Sun newspaper s habit of printing  positive  comments in little frames titled  Why I Love My Sun    There are often invitations for readers to submit pictures  such as the request for examples of  Insincere Smiles   whereby people sent in pictures cut from newspapers and brochures of celebrities and politicians caught smiling in a manner which looks utterly insincere and forced  Tony Blair featured at least twice   A similar series was of men who were wearing absurdly ill fitting wigs  There s also  Up The Arse Corner   where photographs are submitted of people whose pose  and or facial expression  could be misconstrued as being in the midst of an act of buggery   Letterbocks also formerly featured correspondence from  and has brought fame to  the late Abdul Latif  Lord of Harpole  proprietor of the  real  Curry Capital restaurant  formerly the Rupali   Bigg Market  His Lordship often promoted his restaurant with spoof competitions and offers  In December 2006  he appeared in a seasonal broadcast to rival the Queen s Christmas message   3 2 1  Lame to Fame  A semi regular feature in Letterbocks is the  Lame to Fame  column  where writers can send in  claims to fame  where they explain how they are related to well known celebrities  However  the relations are so purposefully distant or commonplace that the claim cannot make them any more notable than a man on the Clapham omnibus  for example   I once had a drink with a bloke who had caught Duran Duran s Simon Le Bon s dog after it had escaped from his big house   and  My sister once shagged Ringo out of The Bootleg Beatles    3 3  Top Tips  A long running segment has been the Top Tips  reader submitted suggestions which are a parody of similar sections found in women s magazines offering domestic and everyday tips to make life easier  In Viz  naturally  they are always absurd  impractical or ludicrous   A small coniferous tree in the corner of your living room is an excellent place to store Christmas decorations  Why waste money on expensive binoculars  Simply stand closer to the object you wish to observe  To stop blue tits pecking at your milk bottles  don t buy any  Dead moths make ideal handgliders for woodlice  Don t invite drug addicts to your house on Boxing Day  They may find the offer of cold turkey embarrassing or offensive Some tips are for ludicrous motives  such as  how to convince neighbours that your house has dry rot   while others are for ostensibly sensible motives but with ridiculous and impractical suggestions for their application   Convince friends that you have a high powered job in the City by leaving for work at 6 am every morning  arriving home at 10 at night  never keeping social appointments and dropping down dead at the age of 36  Save money on sex lines by phoning up the Samaritans and threatening to kill yourself unless they talk dirty Some are just inexplicable   To make your husband s trousers heavier  hang onions from the belt loops  possible reference to Grampa in  Last Exit to Springfield   an episode of The Simpsons  Others inspire running jokes   Fun sized Mars Bars make ideal normal sized Mars Bars for dwarves  Normal sized Mars bars make ideal fun sized Mars Bars for giants  King size Mars Bars make ideal normal sized Mars Bars for giants  Normal sized Mars Bars make ideal king sized Mars Bars for dwarves A more recent trend is for sarcastic tips to be offered that are observations by the readers regarding other people s behaviour  such as a barmaid who suggests male public house customers who are  trying to get into a barmaid s knickers  should  pull back your tenner just as she reaches to take it when paying for a round  It really turns us on   In a similar vein  one reader  or Viz staffer  suggested  Old people – are you worried that people in a hurry might be able to get past you on the pavement  Why not try stumbling aimlessly from side to side  That should stop them    3 3 1  McDonald s  McDonald s was accused of plagiarising a number of Viz Top Tips in an advertising campaign they ran in 1996  Some of the similarities are almost word for word   Save a fortune on laundry bills  Give your dirty shirts to Oxfam  They will wash and iron them  and then you can buy them back for 50p  – Viz Top Tip  published May 1989   Save a fortune on laundry bills  Give your dirty shirts to a second hand shop  They will wash and iron them  and then you can buy them back for 50p  – McDonald s advert The case was later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum  donated to Comic Relief   but many Viz readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use  leading to Top Tips submissions such as   Geordie magazine editors  Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets     by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation  But Viz magazine did take it in good spirit and published them   At around the same time  the following Top Tip was also published   McDonald s advertising executives  Why not steal someone else s idea and then claim you overheard it in a bar  you fucking cunts  In addition  a burger bar McWonald s was used as a story setting and displayed a large W in the style of an inverted Golden Arches M  This establishment had spotty faced teenage staff vomiting and smoking  a child customer informs his mother that he does not want to finish his burger as it  tastes of pigeon and has cigarette butts in it    In a further attack on the company  the map of Cuntinental Europe – given away free with Issue 118 and showing a large cartoon of stereotypes of the British and their neighbours over the relevant geographical areas – displayed the McDonald s logo on potentially insensitive locations  such as the Parthenon and the vicinity of the Leaning Tower of Pisa   3 4  Spoof advertisements and competitions  Viz has had many different spoof adverts for various items  such as ornaments  dolls  sheds  china plates and novelty chess sets  These poke fun at the genuine adverts for such items in magazines found in the colour supplements of Sunday newspapers  Those found in Viz are absurd  such as a breakfast plate depicting Princess Diana s face in the middle of a fried egg   No  22 Shit Street   which was a diorama of a dilapidated council house complete with rabid dog  youthful vandals and a  gently rusting  washing machine in the front yard   and  Little Ted West   a teddy bear dressed to look like serial killer Fred West  Viz has manufactured some of these items and sold them  including a china plate depicting  The Life of Christ   In Cats   featuring pictures of a cat in various stages of Jesus s life  and the Elvis Presley Dambusters Clock Plate of Tutankhamun  a clock featuring Elvis in the style of Tutankhamun s death mask in addition to Avro Lancaster bomber planes   Another staple of Viz advertisement parody are the adverts for public and government services which one would normally not expect to find advertised  for example  one ad consisted of the words  Raped  Burgled  Run over  Why not call the police   placed next to a picture of a grinning policeman  Another ad exhorted male readers to join the British Army  because  all the birds are gagging for squaddies   with the fine print on the reply coupon having a tick box where the interested recruit indicates that spending years ducking for cover in Belfast  should just about see  him  right  when it comes to the ladies   The  PC Brigade  were also featured as if they were the fire brigade  stating they attended emergencies such as  collapsed turbans   freeing gypsies from railings while leaving British people stuck tight  They also carried the slogan  Fueling middle England s persecution complex since 1958    A long running gag has been adverts for sheds  or rather surreal types of sheds   TV Sheds    Shed Bikes    Shed Snakes   etc    Testament to the quality of these is invariably provided by a Mrs  B  of Essex   Adverts for loan companies have been parodied frequently since approximately 2000  usually with an absurd twist  such as ones aimed at vagrants  offering loans of between 5 and 10 pence for a cup of tea  Roger Mellie has frequently starred in such spoof advertisements  both in separate sections in Viz and also his own strip  Mellie is portrayed as someone who is willing to endorse any product whatsoever for money or freebies   Scatological humour also featured heavily in the ads  one ad featured  Clag Gone   which consisted of a stationary bicycle with no seat  Instead  the rider simply placed his naked bottom onto the  Clag Gone  s wire brush wheel  which then cleaned away  winnits    tag nuts  and  dangleberries   Another ad featured a tourist package where eggs were served in great quantities  a happy tourist was featured saying  I m egg bound for Jamaica     Genuine competitions have been run by Viz  with proper prizes  One of the earliest was a competition to win  a ton of money  a pointed satire of tabloid newspapers promising huge cash prizes to boost circulation – the prize was in fact a metric tonne of one  and two pence pieces  equivalent to a few hundred pounds sterling  Recently  they were giving away a plasma screen television provided by the producers of Freddy vs  Jason  Viz poked fun at the movie  describing it as  shite  in the competition description  and described the runners up prizes of DVDs of the film as  frankly worthless   which led to the producers refusing to hand over the prize  for insulting their film   Another spin off was  Roger s Profanisaurus   a thesaurus of  often freshly coined  rude words  phrases and sexual slang submitted by readers  It has been published as several books  the 2002 print of which has a foreword by Terry Jones  This also often features genuine regional slang  Roger s Profanisaurus has become a popular downloadable app for Apple s iPhone   In November 1987  a free mini issue of Viz was given away with issue 23 of computer magazine Your Sinclair  This was done in response to Your Sinclair s competitor  CRASH  giving away a mini copy of Oink  comic with their issue 42   3 5  Photo strips  Occasionally photo strips are included  These parody the format of supernatural and true love British comics which were popular with young girl readers in the 1970s and 1980s  such as  Chiller  and  Jackie   as well as the  real life dilemma  photo strips often found in the advice columns of tabloid newspapers   For example  a young woman is convinced that the spirit of her dead husband has possessed the family dog  and after some soul searching  begins a sexual relationship with the dog  A running joke in these stories is that they often feature a car accident in which one of the characters is run down— in every case  the same man is driving the car  and always responds with the same line   Sorry mate  I didn t see him her    The locations for the photo stories are  probably deliberately  recognisable as the suburbs of Newcastle upon Tyne where the Viz team are based   On occasion  this is explicitly recognised  the one off strip Whitley Baywatch  a spoof of the popular American TV show Baywatch  is based in the North East coastal resort of Whitley Bay  But other stories purporting to be set in London  or without a set location  are often also identifiably near to the Viz editorial offices in Jesmond  In  He just loved to dance   no  103   for example  Komal s Tandoori restaurant in West Jesmond is visible  In  Four minutes to fall in love   no  107   the Gateshead Millennium Bridge provides a backdrop to the dénouement  An occasionally recurring actor in these strips is Arthur 2 Stroke  now acknowledged as the  Guru of Viz  by Chris Donald founder editor  Arthur  former lead singer of the band The Chart Commandos  still continues to perform with  Big Black Bomb  and is still considered to be an innovating force on the Newcastle music scene   One such photo strip was called  I Believe in Father Christmas   where an adult man believes in Father Christmas  His wife  named Virginia  attempts to convince him otherwise  He visits a department store Father Christmas  just like a child  although he asks for a CD from either Dire Straits or Phil Collins  On Christmas night  the man goes downstairs to the living room  as he hears a noise and figures Father Christmas must have come  However  he is surprised to see that an armed robber has broken into his house  who promptly shoots him and flees  His wife  in shock  tends to her husband as he is badly hurt  and he tells her he was wrong to believe in Father Christmas like some small child  However  the wife tearfully says that Father Christmas did indeed come  and left presents for them  The strip ends with the husband saying to his wife  Yes Virginia  there is a Father Christmas    In his book Rude Kids  The Inside Story of Viz  the comic s creator Chris Donald claimed that the first legal action ever taken against Viz was initiated by a man who objected to the use of a picture of his house  taken from an estate agent s catalogue  in one of these photo strips  and that the British tabloid newspaper Sunday Mirror tried to provoke media outrage over another photo strip which  if taken out of context  could be misconstrued as making light of the problem of illegal drugs being offered to children   Actor Sean Bean made a one off appearance in 1996 titled  I ve Bean to Paradise  where the main character  unhappy with his long term relationship  attempts to seek out for more physically attractive women by undergoing a makeover as a lookalike of the actor  played by himself  and passing himself off as the actor with references to his past screen roles   4  Viz in other media  Some of the characters have had their own television cartoon series on Channel 4  They are   The Fat Slags  voiced by Kathy Burke and Jenny Eclair   Roger Mellie  voiced by Peter Cook   Sid the Sexist  voiced by Sammy Johnson   Billy the Fish  voiced by Harry Enfield  In December 2011  Viz produced three animated shorts for Channel 4 s Comedy Blaps with Baby Cow  voiced by Steve Coogan  Sarah Millican  Simon Greenall and Gavin Webster   A one off TV programme Viz – The Documentary was shown on Britain s Channel 4 in 1990  spoofing serious investigative TV shows like Panorama or Dispatches while telling the story of Viz   A computer game using Viz characters was produced in 1991 by Virgin Interactive   The Fat Slags appeared in TV ads for Lucozade  a drink which they hate with a passion  These ads included a mixture of cartoon characters  the slags  and live actors  the men who drink Lucozade    A movie based on The Fat Slags was produced in 2004  but was disowned by the magazine s editors who threatened to stop running the strip in response   A novelty single was released in 1987 for Viz and its Buster Gonad character by the band XTC as  Johnny Japes and His Jesticles   The A side was  Bags of Fun With Buster  b w  Scrotal Scratch Mix    During the Gulf War of 1991  Sepecat Jaguar GR1A bombers of the Royal Air Force featured such Viz characters as Johnny Fartpants  the Fat Slags and Buster Gonad as nose art   5  Controversy  The comic was reprimanded by the United Nations after featuring a strip called  The Thieving Gypsy Bastards  During the resulting court case  UK newspaper The Sun ran a story revealing that the principal Roma man who initiated the action against them was in fact also being tried for  and was later found guilty of  handling stolen property  In the same issue Viz ran a short strip called  The Nice  Honest Gypsies   featuring a kindly Gypsy woman selling pegs door to door and helpfully returning forgotten change   The strip  Wanker Watson   a parody of the children s comic character Winker Watson  led to litigation by D  C  Thomson & Co  Ltd  the owners of the Winker character  In retaliation  Viz featured a new character called  D C  Thompson The Humourless Scottish Git   D C  Thomson then sought revenge by publishing a new cartoon  The Jocks and The Geordies   a revival of an old strip from The Dandy  in which the Geordies  clearly representing Viz  competed with the Jocks  clearly representing Thomson  in a competition to design funny cartoon characters  The Geordies  miserable efforts bore sharp similarity to actual Viz characters  such as  The Boy with Big Pants  – a reference to Felix and his Amazing Underpants   Chris Donald s book Rude Kids  The Inside Story of Viz  notes the good humoured nature of the latter stages of this episode    Sports clothing manufacturer Kappa insisted that the comic drop the name of one of its characters   Kappa Slappa   as it had no permission to use the brand name  Kappa also believed that the character in question insulted its customer base   Slapper  was an obnoxious  uneducated  highly unattractive and sexually promiscuous 14 year old single mother living on a Tyneside council estate  always donning her Kappa shellsuit  After several runs of the strip  Viz agreed to change her name to  Tasha Slappa    In his book Rude Kids  The Inside Story of Viz  Chris Donald mentions that he was interviewed by police after giving the go ahead to publish a Top Tip which could have been interpreted as an incitement to carry out a bomb plot  Donald claims that he then accidentally included the offending statement in that year s Viz annual  and had to have it covered with a sticker by the publishers   Trinny and Susannah threatened to sue the comic after being portrayed as school bullies in a cartoon strip  Fat and Skinny  Suzanna and Trinny   An official Viz spokesman said  We are too busy laughing to comment    6  Bibliography  Highlights of the comic are collected into regular annuals  invariably with innuendo laden titles  There have also been a large number of themed collections published  which focus on a particular character or column   6 1  Annuals  6 2  Themed collections  6 3
