The Mahabharata or Mahābhārata          is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India  the other being the Ramayana   Besides its epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes  the Mahabharata contains philosophical and devotional material  such as a discussion of the four  goals of life  or purusharthas  12 161   Among the principal works and stories in the Mahabharata are the Bhagavad Gita  the story of Damayanti  an abbreviated version of the Ramayana  and the Rishyasringa  often considered as works in their own right   Traditionally  the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to Vyasa  There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers  The oldest preserved parts of the text are thought to be not much older than around 400 BCE  though the origins of the epic probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE  The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period  c  4th century CE   The title may be translated as  the great tale of the Bhārata dynasty   According to the Mahabharata itself  the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24 000 verses called simply Bhārata   The Mahabharata is the longest known epic poem and has been described as  the longest poem ever written   Its longest version consists of over 100 000 shloka or over 200 000 individual verse lines  each shloka is a couplet   and long prose passages  About 1 8 million words in total  the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined  or about four times the length of the Ramayana  W  J  Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahabharata to world civilization to that of the Bible  the works of Shakespeare  the works of Homer  Greek drama  or the Qur an   1  Textual history and structure  The epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyasa  who is also a major character in the epic  Vyasa described it as being itihāsa  history   He also describes the Guru shishya parampara  which traces all great teachers and their students of the Vedic times   The first section of the Mahabharata states that it was Ganesha who wrote down the text to Vyasa s dictation  Ganesha is said to have agreed to write it only if Vyasa never paused in his recitation  Vyasa agrees on condition that Ganesha takes the time to understand what was said before writing it down   The epic employs the story within a story structure  otherwise known as frametales  popular in many Indian religious and non religious works  It is recited by the sage Vaisampayana  a disciple of Vyasa  to the King Janamejaya who is the great grandson of the Pandava prince Arjuna  The story is then recited again by a professional storyteller named Ugrasrava Sauti  many years later  to an assemblage of sages performing the 12 year sacrifice for the king Saunaka Kulapati in the Naimisha Forest   The text has been described by some early 20th century western Indologists as unstructured and chaotic  Hermann Oldenberg supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense  tragic force  but dismissed the full text as a  horrible chaos   Moritz Winternitz  Geschichte der indischen Literatur 1909  considered that  only unpoetical theologists and clumsy scribes  could have lumped the parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole   1 1  Accretion and redaction  Research on the Mahabharata has put an enormous effort into recognizing and dating layers within the text  Some elements of the present Mahabharata can be traced back to Vedic times  The background to the Mahabharata suggests the origin of the epic occurs  after the very early Vedic period  and before  the first Indian  empire  was to rise in the third century B C   That this is  a date not too far removed from the 8th or 9th century B C   is likely  It is generally agreed that  Unlike the Vedas  which have to be preserved letter perfect  the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style   so the earliest  surviving  components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest  external  references we have to the epic  which may include an allusion in Panini s 4th century BCE grammar Ashtādhyāyī 4 2 56  It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a  final form  by the early Gupta period  about the 4th century CE   Vishnu Sukthankar  editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahabharata  commented   It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape  on the basis of an archetype and a stemma codicum  What then is possible  Our objective can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach on the basis of the manuscript material available   That manuscript evidence is somewhat late  given its material composition and the climate of India  but it is very extensive   The Mahabharata itself  1 1 61  distinguishes a core portion of 24 000 verses  the Bharata proper  as opposed to additional secondary material  while the Ashvalayana Grhyasutra  3 4 4  makes a similar distinction  At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized  Jaya  Victory  with 8 800 verses attributed to Vyasa  Bharata with 24 000 verses as recited by Vaisampayana  and finally the Mahabharata as recited by Ugrasrava Sauti with over 100 000 verses  However  some scholars such as John Brockington  argue that Jaya and Bharata refer to the same text  and ascribe the theory of Jaya with 8 800 verses to a misreading of a verse in Adiparvan  1 1 81   The redaction of this large body of text was carried out after formal principles  emphasizing the numbers 18 and 12  The addition of the latest parts may be dated by the absence of the Anushasana parva and the Virata parva from the  Spitzer manuscript   The oldest surviving Sanskrit text dates to the Kushan Period  200 CE    According to what one character says at Mbh  1 1 50  there were three versions of the epic  beginning with Manu  1 1 27   Astika  1 3  sub parva 5  or Vasu  1 57   respectively  These versions would correspond to the addition of one and then another  frame  settings of dialogues  The Vasu version would omit the frame settings and begin with the account of the birth of Vyasa  The astika version would add the sarpasattra and ashvamedha material from Brahmanical literature  introduce the name Mahabharata  and identify Vyasa as the work s author  The redactors of these additions were probably Pancharatrin scholars who according to Oberlies  1998  likely retained control over the text until its final redaction  Mention of the Huna in the Bhishma parva however appears to imply that this parva may have been edited around the 4th century   The Adi parva includes the snake sacrifice  sarpasattra  of Janamejaya  explaining its motivation  detailing why all snakes in existence were intended to be destroyed  and why in spite of this  there are still snakes in existence  This sarpasattra material was often considered an independent tale added to a version of the Mahabharata by  thematic attraction   Minkowski 1991   and considered to have a particularly close connection to Vedic  Brahmana  literature  The Panchavimsha Brahmana  at 25 15 3  enumerates the officiant priests of a sarpasattra among whom the names Dhrtarashtra and Janamejaya  two main characters of the Mahabharata s sarpasattra  as well as Takshaka  the name of a snake in the Mahabharata  occur   1 2  Historical references  The earliest known references to the Mahabharata and its core Bharata date to the Ashtadhyayi  sutra 6 2 38  of Pāṇini  fl  4th century BCE  and in the Ashvalayana Grhyasutra  3 4 4   This may suggest that the core 24 000 verses  known as the Bharata  as well as an early version of the extended Mahabharata  were composed by the 4th century BCE   A report by the Greek writer Dio Chrysostom  c  40   c  120 CE  about Homer s poetry being sung even in India seems to imply that the Iliad had been translated into Sanskrit  However  scholars have  in general  taken this as evidence for the existence of a Mahabharata at this date  whose episodes Dio or his sources identify with the story of the Iliad   Several stories within the Mahabharata took on separate identities of their own in Classical Sanskrit literature  For instance  Abhijñānashākuntala by the renowned Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa  c  400 CE   believed to have lived in the era of the Gupta dynasty  is based on a story that is the precursor to the Mahabharata  Urubhanga  a Sanskrit play written by Bhāsa who is believed to have lived before Kālidāsa  is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of his thighs by Bhima   The copper plate inscription of the Maharaja Sharvanatha  533–534 CE  from Khoh  Satna District  Madhya Pradesh  describes the Mahabharata as a  collection of 100 000 verses   shatasahasri samhita    1 3  The 18 parvas or books  The division into 18 parvas is as follows   2  Historical context  The historicity of the Kurukshetra War is unclear  Many historians estimate the date of the Kurukshetra war to Iron Age India of the 10th century BCE  The setting of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age  Vedic  India  where the Kuru kingdom was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE  A dynastic conflict of the period could have been the inspiration for the Jaya  the foundation on which the Mahabharata corpus was built  with a climactic battle eventually coming to be viewed as an epochal event   Puranic literature presents genealogical lists associated with the Mahabharata narrative  The evidence of the Puranas is of two kinds  Of the first kind  there is the direct statement that there were 1015  or 1050  years between the birth of Parikshit  Arjuna s grandson  and the accession of Mahapadma Nanda  commonly dated to 382 BCE  which would yield an estimate of about 1400 BCE for the Bharata battle  However  this would imply improbably long reigns on average for the kings listed in the genealogies  Of the second kind are analyses of parallel genealogies in the Puranas between the times of Adhisimakrishna  Parikshit s great grandson  and Mahapadma Nanda  Pargiter accordingly estimated 26 generations by averaging 10 different dynastic lists and  assuming 18 years for the average duration of a reign  arrived at an estimate of 850 BCE for Adhisimakrishna  and thus approximately 950 BCE for the Bharata battle   B  B  Lal used the same approach with a more conservative assumption of the average reign to estimate a date of 836 BCE  and correlated this with archaeological evidence from Painted Grey Ware sites  the association being strong between PGW artifacts and places mentioned in the epic   Attempts to date the events using methods of archaeoastronomy have produced  depending on which passages are chosen and how they are interpreted  estimates ranging from the late 4th to the mid 2nd millennium BCE  The late 4th millennium date has a precedent in the calculation of the Kaliyuga epoch  based on planetary conjunctions  by Aryabhata  6th century   His date of February 18 3102 BCE has become widespread in Indian tradition  for example  the Aihole inscription of Pulikeshi II  dated to Saka 556   634 CE  claims that 3735 years have elapsed since the Bharata battle   Another traditional school of astronomers and historians  represented by Vriddha Garga  Varahamihira  author of the Brhatsamhita  and Kalhana  author of the Rajatarangini   place the Bharata war 653 years after the Kaliyuga epoch  corresponding to 2449 BCE   3  Synopsis  The core story of the work is that of a dynastic struggle for the throne of Hastinapura  the kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan  The two collateral branches of the family that participate in the struggle are the Kaurava and the Pandava  Although the Kaurava is the senior branch of the family  Duryodhana  the eldest Kaurava  is younger than Yudhisthira  the eldest Pandava  Both Duryodhana and Yudhisthira claim to be first in line to inherit the throne   The struggle culminates in the great battle of Kurukshetra  in which the Pandavas are ultimately victorious  The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship  instances of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right  as well as the converse   The Mahabharata itself ends with the death of Krishna  and the subsequent end of his dynasty and ascent of the Pandava brothers to heaven  It also marks the beginning of the Hindu age of Kali Yuga  the fourth and final age of mankind  in which great values and noble ideas have crumbled  and man is heading towards the complete dissolution of right action  morality and virtue   3 1  The older generations  King Janamejaya s ancestor Shantanu  the king of Hastinapura  has a short lived marriage with the goddess Ganga and has a son  Devavrata  later to be called Bhishma  a great warrior   who becomes the heir apparent  Many years later  when King Shantanu goes hunting  he sees Satyavati  the daughter of the chief of fisherman  and asks her father for her hand  Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death  To resolve his father s dilemma  Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne  As the fisherman is not sure about the prince s children honouring the promise  Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father s promise   Shantanu has two sons by Satyavati  Chitrāngada and Vichitravirya  Upon Shantanu s death  Chitrangada becomes king  He lives a very short uneventful life and dies  Vichitravirya  the younger son  rules Hastinapura  Meanwhile  the King of Kāśī arranges a swayamvara for his three daughters  neglecting to invite the royal family of Hastinapur  In order to arrange the marriage of young Vichitravirya  Bhishma attends the swayamvara of the three princesses Amba  Ambika and Ambalika  uninvited  and proceeds to abduct them  Ambika and Ambalika consent to be married to Vichitravirya   The oldest princess Amba  however  informs Bhishma that she wishes to marry king of Shalva whom Bhishma defeated at their swayamvara  Bhishma lets her leave to marry king of Shalva  but Shalva refuses to marry her  still smarting at his humiliation at the hands of Bhishma  Amba then returns to marry Bhishma but he refuses due to his vow of celibacy  Amba becomes enraged and becomes Bhishma s bitter enemy  holding him responsible for her plight  Later she is reborn to King Drupada as Shikhandi  or Shikhandini  and causes Bhishma s fall  with the help of Arjuna  in the battle of Kurukshetra   3 2  The Pandava and Kaurava princes  When Vichitravirya dies young without any heirs  Satyavati asks her first son Vyasa to father children with the widows  The eldest  Ambika  shuts her eyes when she sees him  and so her son Dhritarashtra is born blind  Ambalika turns pale and bloodless upon seeing him  and thus her son Pandu is born pale and unhealthy  the term Pandu may also mean  jaundiced    Due to the physical challenges of the first two children  Satyavati asks Vyasa to try once again  However  Ambika and Ambalika send their maid instead  to Vyasa s room  Vyasa fathers a third son  Vidura  by the maid  He is born healthy and grows up to be one of the wisest characters in the Mahabharata  He serves as Prime Minister  Mahamantri or Mahatma  to King Pandu and King Dhritarashtra   When the princes grow up  Dhritarashtra is about to be crowned king by Bhishma when Vidura intervenes and uses his knowledge of politics to assert that a blind person cannot be king  This is because a blind man cannot control and protect his subjects  The throne is then given to Pandu because of Dhritarashtra s blindness  Pandu marries twice  to Kunti and Madri  Dhritarashtra marries Gandhari  a princess from Gandhara  who blindfolds herself so that she may feel the pain that her husband feels  Her brother Shakuni is enraged by this and vows to take revenge on the Kuru family  One day  when Pandu is relaxing in the forest  he hears the sound of a wild animal  He shoots an arrow in the direction of the sound  However the arrow hits the sage Kindama  who curses him that if he engages in a sexual act  he will die  Pandu then retires to the forest along with his two wives  and his brother Dhritarashtra rules thereafter  despite his blindness   Pandu s older queen Kunti  however  had been given a boon by Sage Durvasa that she could invoke any god using a special mantra  Kunti uses this boon to ask Dharma the god of justice  Vayu the god of the wind  and Indra the lord of the heavens for sons  She gives birth to three sons  Yudhisthira  Bhima  and Arjuna  through these gods  Kunti shares her mantra with the younger queen Madri  who bears the twins Nakula and Sahadeva through the Ashwini twins  However  Pandu and Madri indulge in sex  and Pandu dies  Madri dies on his funeral pyre out of remorse  Kunti raises the five brothers  who are from then on usually referred to as the Pandava brothers   Dhritarashtra has a hundred sons through Gandhari  all born after the birth of Yudhishtira  These are the Kaurava brothers  the eldest being Duryodhana  and the second Dushasana  Other Kaurava brothers were Vikarna and Sukarna  The rivalry and enmity between them and the Pandava brothers  from their youth and into manhood  leads to the Kurukshetra war   3 3  Lakshagraha  the house of lac   After the deaths of their mother  Madri  and father  Pandu   the Pandavas and their mother Kunti return to the palace of Hastinapur  Yudhisthira is made Crown Prince by Dhritarashtra  under considerable pressure from his kingdom  Dhritarashtra wanted his own son Duryodhana to become king and lets his ambition get in the way of preserving justice   Shakuni  Duryodhana and Dusasana plot to get rid of the Pandavas  Shakuni calls the architect Purochana to build a palace out of flammable materials like lac and ghee  He then arranges for the Pandavas and the Queen Mother Kunti to stay there  with the intention of setting it alight  However  the Pandavas are warned by their wise uncle  Vidura  who sends them a miner to dig a tunnel  They are able to escape to safety and go into hiding  Back at Hastinapur  the Pandavas and Kunti are presumed dead   3 4  Marriage to Draupadi  Whilst they were in hiding the Pandavas learn of a swayamvara which is taking place for the hand of the Pāñcāla princess Draupadī  The Pandavas enter the competition in disguise as Brahmins  The task is to string a mighty steel bow and shoot a target on the ceiling  which is the eye of a moving artificial fish  while looking at its reflection in oil below  Most of the princes fail  many being unable to lift the bow  Arjuna succeeds however  The Pandavas return home and inform their mother that Arjuna has won a competition and to look at what they have brought back  Without looking  Kunti asks them to share whatever it is Arjuna has won among themselves  On explaining the previous life of Draupadi  she ends up being the wife of all five brothers   3 5  Indraprastha  After the wedding  the Pandava brothers are invited back to Hastinapura  The Kuru family elders and relatives negotiate and broker a split of the kingdom  with the Pandavas obtaining a new territory  Yudhishtira has a new capital built for this territory at Indraprastha  Neither the Pandava nor Kaurava sides are happy with the arrangement however   Shortly after this  Arjuna elopes with and then marries Krishna s sister  Subhadra  Yudhishtira wishes to establish his position as king  he seeks Krishna s advice  Krishna advises him  and after due preparation and the elimination of some opposition  Yudhishthira carries out the rājasūya yagna ceremony  he is thus recognised as pre eminent among kings   The Pandavas have a new palace built for them  by Maya the Danava  They invite their Kaurava cousins to Indraprastha  Duryodhana walks round the palace  and mistakes a glossy floor for water  and will not step in  After being told of his error  he then sees a pond  and assumes it is not water and falls in  Draupadi laughs at him and ridicules him by saying that this is because of his blind father Dhritrashtra  He then decides to avenge his humiliation   3 6  The dice game  Shakuni  Duryodhana s uncle  now arranges a dice game  playing against Yudhishtira with loaded dice  Yudhishtira loses all his wealth  then his kingdom  He then even gambles his brothers  himself  and finally his wife into servitude  The jubilant Kauravas insult the Pandavas in their helpless state and even try to disrobe Draupadi in front of the entire court  but her honour is saved by Krishna who miraculously creates lengths of cloth to replace the ones being removed   Dhritarashtra  Bhishma  and the other elders are aghast at the situation  but Duryodhana is adamant that there is no place for two crown princes in Hastinapura  Against his wishes Dhritarashtra orders for another dice game  The Pandavas are required to go into exile for 12 years  and in the 13th year must remain hidden  If discovered by the Kauravas  they will be forced into exile for another 12 years   3 7  Exile and return  The Pandavas spend thirteen years in exile  many adventures occur during this time  They also prepare alliances for a possible future conflict  They spend their final year in disguise in the court of Virata  and are discovered just after the end of the year   At the end of their exile  they try to negotiate a return to Indraprastha  However  this fails  as Duryodhana objects that they were discovered while in hiding  and that no return of their kingdom was agreed  War becomes inevitable   3 8  The battle at Kurukshetra  The two sides summon vast armies to their help and line up at Kurukshetra for a war  The kingdoms of Panchala  Dwaraka  Kasi  Kekaya  Magadha  Matsya  Chedi  Pandyas  Telinga  and the Yadus of Mathura and some other clans like the Parama Kambojas were allied with the Pandavas  The allies of the Kauravas included the kings of Pragjyotisha  Anga  Kekaya  Sindhudesa  including Sindhus  Sauviras and Sivis   Mahishmati  Avanti in Madhyadesa  Madra  Gandhara  Bahlika people  Kambojas and many others  Before war being declared  Balarama had expressed his unhappiness at the developing conflict and left to go on pilgrimage  thus he does not take part in the battle itself  Krishna takes part in a non combatant role  as charioteer for Arjuna   Before the battle  Arjuna  seeing the opposing army includes many relatives and loved ones  including his great grandfather Bhishma and his teacher Drona  has doubts about the battle and he fails to lift his Gāndeeva bow  Krishna wakes him up to his call of duty in the famous Bhagavad Gita section of the epic   Though initially sticking to chivalrous notions of warfare  both sides soon adopt dishonourable tactics  At the end of the 18 day battle  only the Pandavas  Satyaki  Kripa  Ashwatthama  Kritavarma  Yuyutsu and Krishna survive   3 9  The end of the Pandavas  After  seeing  the carnage  Gandhari who had lost all her sons  curses Krishna to be a witness to a similar annihilation of his family  for though divine and capable of stopping the war  he had not done so  Krishna accepts the curse  which bears fruit 36 years later   The Pandavas who had ruled their kingdom meanwhile  decide to renounce everything  Clad in skins and rags they retire to the Himalaya and climb towards heaven in their bodily form  A stray dog travels with them  One by one the brothers and Draupadi fall on their way  As each one stumbles  Yudhisthira gives the rest the reason for their fall  Draupadi was partial to Arjuna  Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of their looks  Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills  respectively   Only the virtuous Yudhisthira  who had tried everything to prevent the carnage  and the dog remain  The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama  also known as Yama Dharmaraja   and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife  After explaining the nature of the test  Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because  Rajyante narakam dhruvam  any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once  Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices   Arjuna s grandson Parikshit rules after them and dies bitten by a snake  His furious son  Janamejaya  decides to perform a snake sacrifice  sarpasattra  in order to destroy the snakes  It is at this sacrifice that the tale of his ancestors is narrated to him   3 10  The reunion  The Mahabharata mentions that Karna  the Pandavas  and Dhritarashtra s sons eventually ascended to svarga and  attained the state of the gods  and banded together —  serene and free from anger    4  Themes  4 1  Just war  The Mahabharata offers one of the first instances of theorizing about  just war   illustrating many of the standards that would be debated later across the world  In the story  one of five brothers asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified  A long discussion ensues between the siblings  establishing criteria like proportionality  chariots cannot attack cavalry  only other chariots  no attacking people in distress   just means  no poisoned or barbed arrows   just cause  no attacking out of rage   and fair treatment of captives and the wounded   5  Versions  translations  and derivative works  5 1  Regional versions  Many regional versions of the work developed over time  mostly differing only in minor details  or with verses or subsidiary stories being added  These include the Tamil street theatre  terukkuttu and kattaikkuttu  the plays of which use themes from the Tamil language versions of Mahabharata  focusing on Draupadi   5 2  Javanese version  Outside the Indian subcontinent  in Indonesia  a version was developed in ancient Java as Kakawin Bhāratayuddha in the 11th century under the patronage of King Dharmawangsa  990–1016   and later it spread to neighboring island of Bali where today remains a Hindu majority island  despite today Indonesia is the most populous Muslim majority nation  It has become the fertile source for Javanese literature  dance drama  wayang wong   and wayang shadow puppet performances  This Javanese version differ slightly from the original Indian version  For example Draupadi is only be wed to Yudhisthira  not to the entire Pandavas brothers  this might demonstrate ancient Javanese opposition of polyandry practice  The author later added some female characters to be wed to the Pandavas  Arjuna for example is described as having many wives and consorts next to Subhadra  Another difference is Shikhandi did not undergone sex change and remains as a woman  to be wed to Arjuna  and took the role as a warrior princess during the war  Another twist is Gandhari was described as antagonist character that hates Pandava so much  Her hate was out of jealousy  because during svayambara for the hand of Gandhari  she was actually in love with Pandu  but later being wed to his blind elder brother instead  whom she does not love  as a protest she then blindfold herself  Another notable difference is the inclusion of Punakawans  the clown servants of the main characters in the storyline  which is not found in Indian version  This characters includes Semar  Petruk  Gareng and Bagong  they are much loved by Indonesian audiences  There are some spin off episode developed in ancient Java  such as Arjunawiwaha composed in 11th century   5 3  Critical Edition  Between 1919 and 1966  scholars at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute  Pune  compared the various manuscripts of the epic from India and abroad and produced the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata  on 13 000 pages in 19 volumes  followed by the Harivamsha in another two volumes and six index volumes  This is the text that is usually used in current Mahabharata studies for reference  This work is sometimes called the  Pune  or  Poona  edition of the Mahabharata   5 4  Modern interpretations  In Indian cinema  several film versions of the epic exist  dating back to 1920  The internationally acclaimed parallel Bengali film director Satyajit Ray also intended to direct a theatrical adaptation of the epic  but the project was never realized   In Telugu many movies made on Mahabarath which had shown detailed story  But in different the film Daana Veera Soora Karna  1977  directed and acted by N  T  Rama Rao shows Karna a lead character and described his good qualities   In the late 1980s  the Mahabharat TV series  directed by Ravi Chopra  was televised and shown on India s national television  Doordarshan   In the Western world  a well known presentation of the epic is Peter Brook s nine hour play  which premiered in Avignon in 1985  and its five hour movie version The Mahabharata  1989    Mahabharata was also reinterpreted by Shyam Benegal in Kalyug  Kalyug is a modern day replaying of the Mahabharata  Prakash Jha directed 2010 film Raajneeti was partially inspired by Mahabharata   Adaptations of the Mahabarata are often the most expensive films in Indian cinema  The unmade 2004 adaptation Mahabarat by director Rajkumar Santoshi was estimated at 22 million U S  dollars A 2013 animated adaptation holds the record for India s most expensive animated film   Amar Chitra Katha published a 1 260 page comic book version of the Mahabharata   5 5  Persian translation  It was translated into Persian at Akbar s orders  by Faizi and `Abd al Qadir Bada uni  1761–1763  and named Razmnameh   5 6  English translations  The first complete English translation was the Victorian prose version by Kisari Mohan Ganguli  published between 1883 and 1896  Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers  and by M  N  Dutt  Motilal Banarsidass Publishers   Most critics consider the translation by Ganguli to be faithful to the original text  The complete text of Ganguli s translation is in the public domain and is available online  It was originally printed under the name of the publisher  Pratap Chandra Roy   Another English prose translation of the full epic  based on the Critical Edition  is also in progress  published by University Of Chicago Press  initiated by Chicago Indologist J  A  B  van Buitenen  books 1–5  and  following a 20 year hiatus caused by the death of van Buitenen  is being continued by D  Gitomer of DePaul University  book 6   J  L  Fitzgerald of Brown University  books 11–13  and Wendy Doniger of the University of Chicago  books 14–18    An early poetry translation by Romesh Chunder Dutt and published in 1898 condenses the main themes of the Mahabharata into English verse  A later poetic  transcreation   author s own description  of the full epic into English  done by the poet P  Lal is complete  and in 2005 began being published by Writers Workshop  Calcutta  The P  Lal translation is a non rhyming verse by verse rendering  and is the only edition in any language to include all slokas in all recensions of the work  not just those in the Critical Edition   The completion of the publishing project is scheduled for 2010  Sixteen of the eighteen volumes are now available   A project to translate the full epic into English prose  translated by various hands  began to appear in 2005 from the Clay Sanskrit Library  published by New York University Press  The translation is based not on the Critical Edition but on the version known to the commentator Nīlakaṇṭha  Currently available are 15 volumes of the projected 32 volume edition   Indian economist Bibek Debroy has also begun an unabridged English translation in ten volumes  was published in March 2010   5 7  Abridged versions  Many condensed versions  abridgements and novelistic prose retellings of the complete epic have been published in English  including works by Ramesh Menon  William Buck  R  K  Narayan  C  Rajagopalachari  K  M  Munshi  Krishna Dharma  Romesh C  Dutt  Bharadvaja Sarma  John D  Smith and Sharon Maas   A Kawi version is found on the Indonesian island of Bali and was translated by Dr  I  Gusti Putu Phalgunadi  Of the eighteen parvas  only eight Kawi manuscripts remain   5 8  Derivative works  Bhasa  the 2nd  or 3rd century CE Sanskrit playwright  wrote two plays on episodes in the

Alkazi it was staged by numerous directors  V  S  Khandekar s Marathi novel  Yayati  1960  and Girish Karnad s debut play Yayati  1961  are based on the story of King Yayati found in the Mahabharat  Bengali writer and playwright  Buddhadeva Bose wrote three plays set in Mahabharat  Anamni Angana  Pratham Partha and Kalsandhya  Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni wrote a version from the perspective of Draupadi entitled The Palace of Illusions  A Novel  which was published in 2008   6  Jain version  Jain version of Mahabharata can be found in the various Jain texts like Harivamsapurana  the story of Harivamsa  Trisastisalakapurusa Caritra  Hagiography of 63 Illustrious persons   Pandavacaritra  lives of Pandavas  and Pandavapurana  stories of Pandavas   From the earlier canonical literature  Antakrddaaśāh  8th cannon  and Vrisnidasa  upangagama or secondary canon  contain the stories of Neminatha  22nd Tirthankara   Krishna and Balarama  Prof  Padmanabh Jaini notes that  unlike in the Hindu Puranas  the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to Balarama and Krishna in Jain puranas  Instead they serve as names of two distinct class of mighty brothers  who appear nine times in each half of time cycles of the Jain cosmology and rule the half the earth as half chakravartins  Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the Jinacharitra by Bhadrabahu swami  4th–3rd century BCE   According to Jain cosmology Balarama  Krishna and Jarasandha are the ninth and the last set of Baladeva  Vasudeva  and Partivasudeva  The main battle is not the Mahabharata  but the fight between Krishna and Jarasandha who is killed by Krishna  Ultimately  the Pandavas and Balarama take renunciation as Jain monks and are reborn in heavens  while on the other hand Krishna and Jarasandha are reborn in hell  In keeping with the law of karma  Krishna is reborn in hell for his exploits  sexual and violent  while Jarasandha for his evil ways  Prof  Jaini admits a possibility that perhaps because of his popularity  the Jain authors were keen to rehabilitate Krishna  The Jain texts predict that after his karmic term in hell is over sometime during the next half time cycle  Krishna will be reborn as a Jain Tirthankara and attain liberation  Krishna and Balrama are shown as contemporaries and cousins of 22nd Tirthankara  Neminatha  According to this story  Krishna arranged young Neminath’s marriage with Rajamati  the daughter of Ugrasena  but Neminatha  empathizing with the animals which were to be slaughtered for the marriage feast  left the procession suddenly and renounced the world   7  Kuru family tree  This shows the line of royal and family succession  not necessarily the parentage  See the notes below for detail   Key to Symbols  Male  blue border  Female  red border  Pandavas  green box  Kauravas  yellow box Notes  a  Shantanu was a king of the Kuru dynasty or kingdom  and was some generations removed from any ancestor called Kuru  His marriage to Ganga preceded his marriage to Satyavati   b  Pandu and Dhritarashtra were fathered by Vyasa in the niyoga tradition after Vichitravirya s death  Dhritarashtra  Pandu and Vidura were the sons of Vyasa with Ambika  Ambalika and a maid servant respectively   c  Karna was born to Kunti through her invocation of Surya  before her marriage to Pandu   d  Yudhisthira  Bhima  Arjuna  Nakula and Sahadeva were acknowledged sons of Pandu but were begotten by Kunti s invocation of various deities  They all married Draupadi  not shown in tree    e  Duryodhana and his siblings were born at the same time  and they were of the same generation as their Pandava cousins  The birth order of siblings is correctly shown in the family tree  from left to right   except for Vyasa and Bhishma whose birth order is not described  and Vichitravirya who was born after them  The fact that Ambika and Ambalika are sisters is not shown in the family tree  The birth of Duryodhana took place after the birth of Karna  Yudhishtira and Bhima  but before the birth of the remaining Pandava brothers   Some siblings of the characters shown here have been left out for clarity  these include Chitrāngada  the eldest brother of Vichitravirya  Vidura  half brother to Dhritarashtra and Pandu   8  Cultural influence  In the Bhagavad Gita  Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince and elaborates on different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies  with examples and analogies  This has led to the Gita often being described as a concise guide to Hindu philosophy and a practical  self contained guide to life  In more modern times  Swami Vivekananda  Bal Gangadhar Tilak  Mahatma Gandhi and many others used the text to help inspire the Indian independence movement   9  Notes  10
