In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry  nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts  lighter nuclei   The fission process often produces free neutrons and photons  in the form of gamma rays   and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay   Nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on December 17  1938 by German Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann  and explained theoretically in January 1939 by Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch  Frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells  It is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments  heating the bulk material where fission takes place   In order for fission to produce energy  the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be less negative  higher energy  than that of the starting element   Fission is a form of nuclear transmutation because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom  The two nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes  typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2  for common fissile isotopes  Most fissions are binary fissions  producing two charged fragments   but occasionally  2 to 4 times per 1000 events   three positively charged fragments are produced  in a ternary fission  The smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus   Fission as encountered in the modern world is usually a deliberately produced man made nuclear reaction induced by a neutron  It is less commonly encountered as a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay  not requiring a neutron   occurring especially in very high mass number isotopes  The unpredictable composition of the products  which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner  distinguishes fission from purely quantum tunnelling processes such as proton emission  alpha decay and cluster decay  which give the same products each time  Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons  Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons  and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart  This makes possible a self sustaining nuclear chain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon   The amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline  making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy  The products of nuclear fission  however  are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel  and remain so for significant amounts of time  giving rise to a nuclear waste problem  Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the destructive potential of nuclear weapons may counterbalance the desirable qualities of fission as an energy source  and give rise to ongoing political debate over nuclear power   1  Physical overview  1 1  Mechanism  Nuclear fission can occur without neutron bombardment as a type of radioactive decay  This type of fission  called spontaneous fission  is rare except in a few heavy isotopes  In engineered nuclear devices  essentially all nuclear fission occurs as a  nuclear reaction  — a bombardment driven process that results from the collision of two subatomic particles  In nuclear reactions  a subatomic particle collides with an atomic nucleus and causes changes to it  Nuclear reactions are thus driven by the mechanics of bombardment  not by the relatively constant exponential decay and half life characteristic of spontaneous radioactive processes   Many types of nuclear reactions are currently known  Nuclear fission differs importantly from other types of nuclear reactions  in that it can be amplified and sometimes controlled via a nuclear chain reaction  one type of general chain reaction   In such a reaction  free neutrons released by each fission event can trigger yet more events  which in turn release more neutrons and cause more fissions   The chemical element isotopes that can sustain a fission chain reaction are called nuclear fuels  and are said to be fissile  The most common nuclear fuels are 235U  the isotope of uranium with an atomic mass of 235 and of use in nuclear reactors  and 239Pu  the isotope of plutonium with an atomic mass of 239   These fuels break apart into a bimodal range of chemical elements with atomic masses centering near 95 and 135 u  fission products   Most nuclear fuels undergo spontaneous fission only very slowly  decaying instead mainly via an alpha beta decay chain over periods of millennia to eons  In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon  the overwhelming majority of fission events are induced by bombardment with another particle  a neutron  which is itself produced by prior fission events   Nuclear fissions in fissile fuels are the result of the nuclear excitation energy produced when a fissile nucleus captures a neutron  This energy  resulting from the neutron capture  is a result of the attractive nuclear force acting between the neutron and nucleus  It is enough to deform the nucleus into a double lobed  drop   to the point that nuclear fragments exceed the distances at which the nuclear force can hold two groups of charged nucleons together  and when this happens  the two fragments complete their separation and then are driven further apart by their mutually repulsive charges  in a process which becomes irreversible with greater and greater distance  A similar process occurs in fissionable isotopes  such as uranium 238   but in order to fission  these isotopes require additional energy provided by fast neutrons  such as those produced by nuclear fusion in thermonuclear weapons    The liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus predicts equal sized fission products as an outcome of nuclear deformation  The more sophisticated nuclear shell model is needed to mechanistically explain the route to the more energetically favorable outcome  in which one fission product is slightly smaller than the other  A theory of the fission based on shell model has been formulated by Maria Goeppert Mayer   The most common fission process is binary fission  and it produces the fission products noted above  at 95±15 and 135±15 u  However  the binary process happens merely because it is the most probable  In anywhere from 2 to 4 fissions per 1000 in a nuclear reactor  a process called ternary fission produces three positively charged fragments  plus neutrons  and the smallest of these may range from so small a charge and mass as a proton  Z 1   to as large a fragment as argon  Z 18   The most common small fragments  however  are composed of 90% helium 4 nuclei with more energy than alpha particles from alpha decay  so called  long range alphas  at ~ 16 MeV   plus helium 6 nuclei  and tritons  the nuclei of tritium   The ternary process is less common  but still ends up producing significant helium 4 and tritium gas buildup in the fuel rods of modern nuclear reactors   1 2  Energetics  1 2 1  Input  The fission of a heavy nucleus requires a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts  MeV  to initially overcome the strong force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape  and from there  deform it into a two lobed   peanut   shape in which the lobes are able to continue to separate from each other  pushed by their mutual positive charge  in the most common process of binary fission  two positively charged fission products + neutrons   Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance  beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together  the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the  longer range  electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments  The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other  at high energy   About 6 MeV of the fission input energy is supplied by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the heavy nucleus via the strong force  however  in many fissionable isotopes  this amount of energy is not enough for fission  Uranium 238  for example  has a near zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than one MeV energy  If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism  the nucleus will not fission  but will merely absorb the neutron  as happens when U 238 absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons  to become U 239  The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms  one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron  which is increasingly able to fission a fissionable heavy nucleus as it exceeds a kinetic energy of one MeV or more  so called fast neutrons   Such high energy neutrons are able to fission U 238 directly  see thermonuclear weapon for application  where the fast neutrons are supplied by nuclear fusion   However  this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor  as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission U 238  fission neutrons have a mode energy of 2 MeV  but a median of only 0 75 MeV  meaning half of them have less than this insufficient energy    Among the heavy actinide elements  however  those isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons  such as U 235 with 143 neutrons  bind an extra neutron with an additional 1 to 2 MeV of energy over an isotope of the same element with an even number of neutrons  such as U 238 with 146 neutrons   This extra binding energy is made available as a result of the mechanism of neutron pairing effects  This extra energy results from the Pauli exclusion principle allowing an extra neutron to occupy the same nuclear orbital as the last neutron in the nucleus  so that the two form a pair  In such isotopes  therefore  no neutron kinetic energy is needed  for all the necessary energy is supplied by absorption of any neutron  either of the slow or fast variety  the former are used in moderated nuclear reactors  and the latter are used in fast neutron reactors  and in weapons   As noted above  the subgroup of fissionable elements that may be fissioned efficiently with their own fission neutrons  thus potentially causing a nuclear chain reaction in relatively small amounts of the pure material  are termed  fissile   Examples of fissile isotopes are U 235 and plutonium 239   1 2 2  Output  Typical fission events release about two hundred million eV  200 MeV  of energy for each fission event  The exact isotope which is fissioned  and whether or not it is fissionable or fissile  has only a small impact on the amount of energy released  This can be easily seen by examining the curve of binding energy  image below   and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7 6 MeV per nucleon  Looking further left on the curve of binding energy  where the fission products cluster  it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8 5 MeV per nucleon  Thus  in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide s range of mass  roughly 0 9 MeV is released per nucleon of the starting element  The fission of U235 by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of U238 by a fast neutron  This energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides as well   By contrast  most chemical oxidation reactions  such as burning coal or TNT  release at most a few eV per event  So  nuclear fuel contains at least ten million times more usable energy per unit mass than does chemical fuel  The energy of nuclear fission is released as kinetic energy of the fission products and fragments  and as electromagnetic radiation in the form of gamma rays  in a nuclear reactor  the energy is converted to heat as the particles and gamma rays collide with the atoms that make up the reactor and its working fluid  usually water or occasionally heavy water or molten salts   When a uranium nucleus fissions into two daughter nuclei fragments  about 0 1 percent of the mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200 MeV  For uranium 235  total mean fission energy 202 5 MeV   typically ~169 MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei  which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light  due to Coulomb repulsion  Also  an average of 2 5 neutrons are emitted  with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2 MeV  total of 4 8 MeV   The fission reaction also releases ~7 MeV in prompt gamma ray photons  The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3 5% of its energy as gamma rays  less than 2 5% of its energy as fast neutrons  total of both types of radiation ~ 6%   and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments  this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter  as simple heat   In an atomic bomb  this heat may serve to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100 million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X rays  which convert some of this energy to ionizing radiation  However  in nuclear reactors  the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as low temperature heat  which itself causes little or no ionization   So called neutron bombs  enhanced radiation weapons  have been constructed which release a larger fraction of their energy as ionizing radiation  specifically  neutrons   but these are all thermonuclear devices which rely on the nuclear fusion stage to produce the extra radiation  The energy dynamics of pure fission bombs always remain at about 6% yield of the total in radiation  as a prompt result of fission   The total prompt fission energy amounts to about 181 MeV  or ~ 89% of the total energy which is eventually released by fission over time  The remaining ~ 11% is released in beta decays which have various half lives  but begin as a process in the fission products immediately  and in delayed gamma emissions associated with these beta decays  For example  in uranium 235 this delayed energy is divided into about 6 5 MeV in betas  8 8 MeV in antineutrinos  released at the same time as the betas   and finally  an additional 6 3 MeV in delayed gamma emission from the excited beta decay products  for a mean total of ~10 gamma ray emissions per fission  in all   Thus  about 6 5% of the total energy of fission is released some time after the event  as non prompt or delayed ionizing radiation  and the delayed ionizing energy is about evenly divided between gamma and beta ray energy   In a reactor that has been operating for some time  the radioactive fission products will have built up to steady state concentrations such that their rate of decay is equal to their rate of formation  so that their fractional total contribution to reactor heat  via beta decay  is the same as these radioisotopic fractional contributions to the energy of fission  Under these conditions  the 6 5% of fission which appears as delayed ionizing radiation  delayed gammas and betas from radioactive fission products  contributes to the steady state reactor heat production under power  It is this output fraction which remains when the reactor is suddenly shut down  undergoes scram   For this reason  the reactor decay heat output begins at 6 5% of the full reactor steady state fission power  once the reactor is shut down  However  within hours  due to decay of these isotopes  the decay power output is far less  See decay heat for detail   The remainder of the delayed energy  8 8 MeV 202 5 MeV   4 3% of total fission energy  is emitted as antineutrinos  which as a practical matter  are not considered  ionizing radiation   The reason is that energy released as antineutrinos is not captured by the reactor material as heat  and escapes directly through all materials  including the Earth  at nearly the speed of light  and into interplanetary space  the amount absorbed is minuscule   Neutrino radiation is ordinarily not classed as ionizing radiation  because it is almost entirely not absorbed and therefore does not produce effects  although the very rare neutrino event is ionizing   Almost all of the rest of the radiation  6 5% delayed beta and gamma radiation  is eventually converted to heat in a reactor core or its shielding   Some processes involving neutrons are notable for absorbing or finally yielding energy — for example neutron kinetic energy does not yield heat immediately if the neutron is captured by a uranium 238 atom to breed plutonium 239  but this energy is emitted if the plutonium 239 is later fissioned  On the other hand  so called delayed neutrons emitted as radioactive decay products with half lives up to several minutes  from fission daughters  are very important to reactor control  because they give a characteristic  reaction  time for the total nuclear reaction to double in size  if the reaction is run in a  delayed critical  zone which deliberately relies on these neutrons for a supercritical chain reaction  one in which each fission cycle yields more neutrons than it absorbs   Without their existence  the nuclear chain reaction would be prompt critical and increase in size faster than it could be controlled by human intervention  In this case  the first experimental atomic reactors would have run away to a dangerous and messy  prompt critical reaction  before their operators could have manually shut them down  for this reason  designer Enrico Fermi included radiation counter triggered control rods  suspended by electromagnets  which could automatically drop into the center of Chicago Pile 1   If these delayed neutrons are captured without producing fissions  they produce heat as well   1 3  Product nuclei and binding energy  In fission there is a preference to yield fragments with even proton numbers  which is called the odd even effect on the fragments charge distribution  However  no odd even effect is observed on fragment mass number distribution  This result is attributed to nucleon pair breaking   In nuclear fission events the nuclei may break into any combination of lighter nuclei  but the most common event is not fission to equal mass nuclei of about mass 120  the most common event  depending on isotope and process  is a slightly unequal fission in which one daughter nucleus has a mass of about 90 to 100 u and the other the remaining 130 to 140 u  Unequal fissions are energetically more favorable because this allows one product to be closer to the energetic minimum near mass 60 u  only a quarter of the average fissionable mass   while the other nucleus with mass 135 u is still not far out of the range of the most tightly bound nuclei  another statement of this  is that the atomic binding energy curve is slightly steeper to the left of mass 120 u than to the right of it    1 4  Origin of the active energy and the curve of binding energy  Nuclear fission of heavy elements produces energy because the specific binding energy  binding energy per mass  of intermediate mass nuclei with atomic numbers and atomic masses close to 62Ni and 56Fe is greater than the nucleon specific binding energy of very heavy nuclei  so that energy is released when heavy nuclei are broken apart  The total rest masses of the fission products  Mp  from a single reaction is less than the mass of the original fuel nucleus  M   The excess mass Δm   M – Mp is the invariant mass of the energy that is released as photons  gamma rays  and kinetic energy of the fission fragments  according to the mass energy equivalence formula E   mc2   The variation in specific binding energy with atomic number is due to the interplay of the two fundamental forces acting on the component nucleons  protons and neutrons  that make up the nucleus  Nuclei are bound by an attractive nuclear force between nucleons  which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons  However  the nuclear force acts only over relatively short ranges  a few nucleon diameters   since it follows an exponentially decaying Yukawa potential which makes it insignificant at longer distances  The electrostatic repulsion is of longer range  since it decays by an inverse square rule  so that nuclei larger than about 12 nucleons in diameter reach a point that the total electrostatic repulsion overcomes the nuclear force and causes them to be spontaneously unstable  For the same reason  larger nuclei  more than about eight nucleons in diameter  are less tightly bound per unit mass than are smaller nuclei  breaking a large nucleus into two or more intermediate sized nuclei releases energy  The origin of this energy is the nuclear force  which intermediate sized nuclei allows to act more efficiently  because each nucleon has more neighbors which are within the short range attraction of this force  Thus less energy is needed in the smaller nuclei and the difference to the state before is set free   Also because of the short range of the strong binding force  large stable nuclei must contain proportionally more neutrons than do the lightest elements  which are most stable with a 1 to 1 ratio of protons and neutrons  Nuclei which have more than 20 protons cannot be stable unless they have more than an equal number of neutrons  Extra neutrons stabilize heavy elements because they add to strong force binding  which acts between all nucleons  without adding to proton–proton repulsion  Fission products have  on average  about the same ratio of neutrons and protons as their parent nucleus  and are therefore usually unstable to beta decay  which changes neutrons to protons  because they have proportionally too many neutrons compared to stable isotopes of similar mass   This tendency for fission product nuclei to beta decay is the fundamental cause of the problem of radioactive high level waste from nuclear reactors  Fission products tend to be beta emitters  emitting fast moving electrons to conserve electric charge  as excess neutrons convert to protons in the fission product atoms  See Fission products  by element  for a description of fission products sorted by element   1 5  Chain reactions  Several heavy elements  such as uranium  thorium  and plutonium  undergo both spontaneous fission  a form of radioactive decay and induced fission  a form of nuclear reaction  Elemental isotopes that undergo induced fission when struck by a free neutron are called fissionable  isotopes that undergo fission when struck by a thermal  slow moving neutron are also called fissile  A few particularly fissile and readily obtainable isotopes  notably 233U  235U and 239Pu  are called nuclear fuels because they can sustain a chain reaction and can be obtained in large enough quantities to be useful   All fissionable and fissile isotopes undergo a small amount of spontaneous fission which releases a few free neutrons into any sample of nuclear fuel  Such neutrons would escape rapidly from the fuel and become a free neutron  with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes before decaying to protons and beta particles  However  neutrons almost invariably impact and are absorbed by other nuclei in the vicinity long before this happens  newly created fission neutrons move at about 7% of the speed of light  and even moderated neutrons move at about 8 times the speed of sound   Some neutrons will impact fuel nuclei and induce further fissions  releasing yet more neutrons  If enough nuclear fuel is assembled in one place  or if the escaping neutrons are sufficiently contained  then these freshly emitted neutrons outnumber the neutrons that escape from the assembly  and a sustained nuclear chain reaction will take place   An assembly that supports a sustained nuclear chain reaction is called a critical assembly or  if the assembly is almost entirely made of a nuclear fuel  a critical mass  The word  critical  refers to a cusp in the behavior of the differential equation that governs the number of free neutrons present in the fuel  if less than a critical mass is present  then the amount of neutrons is determined by radioactive decay  but if a critical mass or more is present  then the amount of neutrons is controlled instead by the physics of the chain reaction  The actual mass of a critical mass of nuclear fuel depends strongly on the geometry and surrounding materials   Not all fissionable isotopes can sustain a chain reaction  For example  238U  the most abundant form of uranium  is fissionable but not fissile  it undergoes induced fission when impacted by an energetic neutron with over 1 MeV of kinetic energy  However  too few of the neutrons produced by 238U fission are energetic enough to induce further fissions in 238U  so no chain reaction is possible with this isotope  Instead  bombarding 238U with slow neutrons causes it to absorb them  becoming 239U  and decay by beta emission to 239Np which then decays again by the same process to 239Pu  that process is used to manufacture 239Pu in breeder reactors  In situ plutonium production also contributes to the neutron chain reaction in other types of reactors after sufficient plutonium 239 has been produced  since plutonium 239 is also a fissile element which serves as fuel  It is estimated that up to half of the power produced by a standard  non breeder  reactor is produced by the fission of plutonium 239 produced in place  over the total life cycle of a fuel load   Fissionable  non fissile isotopes can be used as fission energy source even without a chain reaction  Bombarding 238U with fast neutrons induces fissions  releasing energy as long as the external neutron source is present  This is an important effect in all reactors where fast neutrons from the fissile isotope can cause the fission of nearby 238U nuclei  which means that some small part of the 238U is  burned up  in all nuclear fuels  especially in fast breeder reactors that operate with higher energy neutrons  That same fast fission effect is used to augment the energy released by modern thermonuclear weapons  by jacketing the weapon with 238U to react with neutrons released by nuclear fusion at the center of the device   1 6  Fission reactors  Critical fission reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor  In a critical fission reactor  neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions  to sustain a controllable amount of energy release  Devices that produce engineered but non self sustaining fission reactions are subcritical fission reactors  Such devices use radioactive decay or particle accelerators to trigger fissions   Critical fission reactors are built for three primary purposes  which typically involve different engineering trade offs to take advantage of either the heat or the neutrons produced by the fission chain reaction   power reactors are intended to produce heat for nuclear power  either as part of a generating station or a local power system such as a nuclear submarine   research reactors are intended to produce neutrons and or activate radioactive sources for scientific  medical  engineering  or other research purposes   breeder reactors are intended to produce nuclear fuels in bulk from more abundant isotopes  The better known fast breeder reactor makes 239Pu  a nuclear fuel  from the naturally very abundant 238U  not a nuclear fuel   Thermal breeder reactors previously tested using 232Th to breed the fissile isotope 233U  thorium fuel cycle  continue to be studied and developed  While  in principle  all fission reactors can act in all three capacities  in practice the tasks lead to conflicting engineering goals and most reactors have been built with only one of the above tasks in mind   There are several early counter examples  such as the Hanford N reactor  now decommissioned   Power reactors generally convert the kinetic energy of fission products into heat  which is used to heat a working fluid and drive a heat engine that generates mechanical or electrical power  The working fluid is usually water with a steam turbine  but some designs use other materials such as gaseous helium  Research reactors produce neutrons that are used in various ways  with the heat of fission being treated as an unavoidable waste product  Breeder reactors are a specialized form of research reactor  with the caveat that the sample being irradiated is usually the fuel itself  a mixture of 238U and 235U  For a more detailed description of the physics and operating principles of critical fission reactors  see nuclear reactor physics  For a description of their social  political  and environmental aspects  see nuclear power   1 7  Fission bombs  One class of nuclear weapon  a fission bomb  not to be confused with the fusion bomb   otherwise known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb  is a fission reactor designed to liberate as much energy as possible as rapidly as possible  before the released energy causes the reactor to explode  and the chain reaction to stop   Development of nuclear weapons was the motivation behind early research into nuclear fission  the Manhattan Project of the U S  military during World War II carried out most of the early scientific work on fission chain reactions  culminating in the Trinity test bomb and the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs that were exploded over the cities Hiroshima  and Nagasaki  Japan in August 1945   Even the first fission bombs were thousands of times more explosive than a comparable mass of chemical explosive  For example  Little Boy weighed a total of about four tons  of which 60 kg was nuclear fuel  and was long  it also yielded an explosion equivalent to about 15 kilotons of TNT  destroying a large part of the city of Hiroshima  Modern nuclear weapons  which include a thermonuclear fusion as well as one or more fission stages  are hundreds of times more energetic for their weight than the first pure fission atomic bombs  see nuclear weapon yield   so that a modern single missile warhead bomb weighing less than 1 8 as much as Little Boy  see for example W88  has a yield of 475 000 tons of TNT  and could bring destruction to about 10 times the city area   While the fundamental physics of the fission chain reaction in a nuclear weapon is similar to the physics of a controlled nuclear reactor  the two types of device must be engineered quite differently  see nuclear reactor physics   A nuclear bomb is designed to release all its energy at once  while a reactor is designed to generate a steady supply of useful power  While overheating of a reactor can lead to  and has led to  meltdown and steam explosions  the much lower uranium enrichment makes it impossible for a nuclear reactor to explode with the same destructive power as a nuclear weapon  It is also difficult to extract useful power from a nuclear bomb  although at least one rocket propulsion system  Project Orion  was intended to work by exploding fission bombs behind a massively padded and shielded spacecraft   The strategic importance of nuclear weapons is a major reason why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive  Viable fission bomb designs are  arguably  within the capabilities of many being relatively simple from an engineering viewpoint  However  the difficulty of obtaining fissile nuclear material to realize the designs  is the key to the relative unavailability of nuclear weapons to all but modern industrialized governments with special programs to produce fissile materials  see uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel cycle    2  History  2 1  Discovery of nuclear fission  The discovery of nuclear fission occurred in 1938 in the buildings of Kaiser Wilhelm Society for Chemistry  today part of the Free University of Berlin  following nearly five decades of work on the science of radioactivity and the elaboration of new nuclear physics that described the components of atoms  In 1911  Ernest Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in which a very small  dense and positively charged nucleus of protons  the neutron had not yet been discovered  was surrounded by orbiting  negatively charged electrons  the Rutherford model   Niels Bohr improved upon this in 1913 by reconciling the quantum behavior of electrons  the Bohr model   Work by Henri Becquerel  Marie Curie  Pierre Curie  and Rutherford further elaborated that the nucleus  though tightly bound  could undergo different forms of radioactive decay  and thereby transmute into other elements   For example  by alpha decay  the emission of an alpha particle—two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium nucleus    Some work in nuclear transmutation had been done  In 1917  Rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen  using alpha particles directed at nitrogen 14N + α → 17O + p   This was the first observation of a nuclear reaction  that is  a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus  Eventually  in 1932  a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford s colleagues Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft  who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium 7  to split this nucleus into two alpha particles  The feat was popularly known as  splitting the atom   although it was not the modern nuclear fission reaction later discovered in heavy elements  which is discussed below  Meanwhile  the possibility of combining nuclei—nuclear fusion—had been studied in connection with understanding the processes which power stars  The first artificial fusion reaction had been achieved by Mark Oliphant in 1932  using two accelerated deuterium nuclei  each consisting of a single proton bound to a single neutron  to create a helium nucleus   After English physicist James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932  Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons in 1934  Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons  which the group dubbed ausonium and hesperium  However  not all were convinced by Fermi s analysis of his results  The German chemist Ida Noddack notably suggested in print in 1934 that instead of creating a new  heavier element 93  that  it is conceivable that the nucleus breaks up into several large fragments   However  Noddack s conclusion was not pursued at the time   After the Fermi publication  Otto Hahn  Lise Meitner  and Fritz Strassmann began performing similar experiments in Berlin  Meitner  an Austrian Jew  lost her citizenship with the  Anschluss   the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in March 1938  but she fled in July 1938 to Sweden and started a correspondence by mail with Hahn in Berlin  By coincidence  her nephew Otto Robert Frisch  also a refugee  was also in Sweden when Meitner received a letter from Hahn dated 19 December describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium  Hahn suggested a bursting of the nucleus  but he was unsure of what the physical basis for the results were  Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium  and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus  Frisch was skeptical  but Meitner trusted Hahn s ability as a chemist  Marie Curie had been separating barium from radium for many years  and the techniques were well known  According to Frisch   Was it a mistake  No  said Lise Meitner  Hahn was too good a chemist for that  But how could barium be formed from uranium  No larger fragments than protons or helium nuclei  alpha particles  had ever been chipped away from nuclei  and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available  Nor was it possible that the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across  A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken  George Gamow had suggested early on  and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop  Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner  by first becoming elongated  then constricted  and finally being torn rather than broken in two  We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process  just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones  But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way  they were electrically charged  and that was known to counteract the surface tension  The charge of a uranium nucleus  we found  was indeed large enough to overcome the effect of the surface tension almost completely  so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop  ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation  such as the impact of a single neutron  But there was another problem  After separation  the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy  about 200 MeV in all  where could that energy come from     Lise Meitner    worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one fifth the mass of a proton  Now whenever mass disappears energy is created  according to Einstein s formula E mc2  and one fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200MeV  So here was the source for that energy  it all fitted  In short  Meitner and Frisch had correctly interpreted Hahn s results to mean that the nucleus of uranium had split roughly in half  Frisch suggested the process be named  nuclear fission   by analogy to the process of living cell division into two cells  which was then called binary fission  Just as the term nuclear  chain reaction  would later be borrowed from chemistry  so the term  fission  was borrowed from biology   On 22 December 1938  Hahn and Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting that they had discovered the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons  Simultaneously  they communicated these results to Meitner in Sweden  She and Frisch correctly interpreted the results as evidence of nuclear fission  Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939  For proving that the barium resulting from his bombardment of uranium with neutrons was the product of nuclear fission  Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1944  the sole recipient   for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei    The award was actually given to Hahn in 1945  as  the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of the year s nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel   In such cases  the Nobel Foundation s statutes permit that year s prize be reserved until the following year    News spread quickly of the new discovery  which was correctly seen as an entirely novel physical effect with great scientific—and potentially practical—possibilities  Meitner’s and Frisch’s interpretation of the discovery of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr  who was to lecture at Princeton University  I I  Rabi and Willis Lamb  two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton  heard the news and carried it back to Columbia  Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi  Fermi gave credit to Lamb  Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi  Not finding Fermi in his office  Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Herbert L  Anderson  Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said  “Young man  let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics ” It was clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment  On 25 January 1939  a Columbia University team conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States  which was done in the basement of Pupin Hall  the members of the team were Herbert L  Anderson  Eugene T  Booth  John R  Dunning  Enrico Fermi  G  Norris Glasoe  and Francis G  Slack  The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons  and measuring the energy thus released  The results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that it was the isotope uranium 235 in particular that was fissioning  The next day  the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington  D C  under the joint auspices of the George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington  There  the news on nuclear fission was spread even further  which fostered many more experimental demonstrations   During this period the Hungarian physicist Leó Szilárd  who was residing in the United States at the time  realized that the neutron driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction  Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933  upon reading Rutherford s disparaging remarks about generating power from his team s 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium  However  Szilárd had not been able to achieve a neutron driven chain reaction with neutron rich light atoms  In theory  if in a neutron driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one  then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions  producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions  It was thus a possibility that the fission of uranium could yield vast amounts of energy for civilian or military purposes  i e   electric power generation or atomic bombs    Szilard now urged Fermi  in New York  and Frédéric Joliot Curie  in Paris  to refrain from publishing on the possibility of a chain reaction  lest the Nazi government become aware of the possibilities on the eve of what would later be known as World War II  With some hesitation Fermi agreed to self censor  But Joliot Curie did not  and in April 1939 his team in Paris  including Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski  reported in the journal Nature that the number of neutrons emitted with nuclear fission of 235U was then reported at 3 5 per fission   They later corrected this to 2 6 per fission   Simultaneous work by Szilard and Walter Zinn confirmed these results  The results suggested the possibility of building nuclear reactors  first called  neutronic reactors  by Szilard and Fermi  and even nuclear bombs  However  much was still unknown about fission and chain reaction systems   2 2  Fission chain reaction realized   Chain reactions  at that time were a known phenomenon in chemistry  but the analogous process in nuclear physics  using neutrons  had been foreseen as early as 1933 by Szilárd  although Szilárd at that time had no idea with what materials the process might be initiated  Szilárd considered that neutrons would be ideal for such a situation  since they lacked an electrostatic charge   With the news of fission neutrons from uranium fission  Szilárd immediately understood the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction using uranium  In the summer  Fermi and Szilard proposed the idea of a nuclear reactor  pile  to mediate this process  The pile would use natural uranium as fuel  Fermi had shown much earlier that neutrons were far more effectively captured by atoms if they were of low energy  so called  slow  or  thermal  neutrons   because for quantum reasons it made the atoms look like much larger targets to the neutrons  Thus to slow down the secondary neutrons released by the fissioning uranium nuclei  Fermi and Szilard proposed a graphite  moderator   against which the fast  high energy secondary neutrons would collide  effectively slowing them down  With enough uranium  and with pure enough graphite  their  pile  could theoretically sustain a slow neutron chain reaction  This would result in the production of heat  as well as the creation of radioactive fission products   In August 1939  Szilard and fellow Hungarian refugees physicists Teller and Wigner thought that the Germans might make use of the fission chain reaction and were spurred to attempt to attract the attention of the United States government to the issue  Towards this  they persuaded German Jewish refugee Albert Einstein to lend his name to a letter directed to President Franklin Roosevelt  The Einstein–Szilárd letter suggested the possibility of a uranium bomb deliverable by ship  which would destroy  an entire harbor and much of the surrounding countryside   The President received the letter on 11 October 1939 — shortly after World War II began in Europe  but two years before U S  entry into it  Roosevelt ordered that a scientific committee be authorized for overseeing uranium work and allocated a small sum of money for pile research   In England  James Chadwick proposed an atomic bomb utilizing natural uranium  based on a paper by Rudolf Peierls with the mass needed for critical state being 30–40 tons  In America  J  Robert Oppenheimer thought that a cube of uranium deuteride 10 cm on a side  about 11 kg of uranium  might  blow itself to hell   In this design it was still thought that a moderator would need to be used for nuclear bomb fission  this turned out not to be the case if the fissile isotope was separated   In December  Werner Heisenberg delivered a report to the German Ministry of War on the possibility of a uranium bomb  Most of these models were still under the assumption that the bombs would be powered by slow neutron reactions—and thus be similar to a reactor undergoing a meltdown   In Birmingham  England  Frisch teamed up with Peierls  a fellow German Jewish refugee  They had the idea of using a purified mass of the uranium isotope 235U  which had a cross section just determined  and which was much larger than that of 238U or natural uranium  which is 99 3% the latter isotope   Assuming that the cross section for fast neutron fission of 235U was the same as for slow neutron fission  they determined that a pure 235U bomb could have a critical mass of only 6 kg instead of tons  and that the resulting explosion would be tremendous   The amount actually turned out to be 15 kg  although several times this amount was used in the actual uranium  Little Boy  bomb   In February 1940 they delivered the Frisch–Peierls memorandum  Ironically  they were still officially considered  enemy aliens  at the time  Glenn Seaborg  Joseph W  Kennedy  Arthur Wahl and Italian Jewish refugee Emilio Segrè shortly thereafter discovered 239Pu in the decay products of 239U produced by bombarding 238U with neutrons  and determined it to be a fissile material  like 235U   The possibility of isolating uranium 235 was technically daunting  because uranium 235 and uranium 238 are chemically identical  and vary in their mass by only the weight of three neutrons  However  if a sufficient quantity of uranium 235 could be isolated  it would allow for a fast neutron fission chain reaction  This would be extremely explosive  a true  atomic bomb   The discovery that plutonium 239 could be produced in a nuclear reactor pointed towards another approach to a fast neutron fission bomb  Both approaches were extremely novel and not yet well understood  and there was considerable scientific skepticism at the idea that they could be developed in a short amount of time   On June 28  1941  the Office of Scientific Research and Development was formed in the U S  to mobilize scientific resources and apply the results of research to national defense  In September  Fermi assembled his first nuclear  pile  or reactor  in an attempt to create a slow neutron induced chain reaction in uranium  but the experiment failed to achieve criticality  due to lack of proper materials  or not enough of the proper materials which were available   Producing a fission chain reaction in natural uranium fuel was found to be far from trivial  Early nuclear reactors did not use isotopically enriched uranium  and in consequence they were required to use large quantities of highly purified graphite as neutron moderation materials  Use of ordinary water  as opposed to heavy water  in nuclear reactors requires enriched fuel — the partial separation and relative enrichment of the rare 235U isotope from the far more common 238U isotope  Typically  reactors also require inclusion of extremely chemically pure neutron moderator materials such as deuterium  in heavy water   helium  beryllium  or carbon  the latter usually as graphite   The high purity for carbon is required because many chemical impurities such as the boron 10 component of natural boron  are very strong neutron absorbers and thus poison the chain reaction and end it prematurely    Production of such materials at industrial scale had to be solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production to be accomplished  Up to 1940  the total amount of uranium metal produced in the USA was not more than a few grams  and even this was of doubtful purity  of metallic beryllium not more than a few kilograms  and concentrated deuterium oxide  heavy water  not more than a few kilograms  Finally  carbon had never been produced in quantity with anything like the purity required of a moderator   The problem of producing large amounts of high purity uranium was solved by Frank Spedding using the thermite or  Ames  process  Ames Laboratory was established in 1942 to produce the large amounts of natural  unenriched  uranium metal that would be necessary for the research to come  The critical nuclear chain reaction success of the Chicago Pile 1  December 2  1942  which used unenriched  natural  uranium  like all of the atomic  piles  which produced the plutonium for the atomic bomb  was also due specifically to Szilard s realization that very pure graphite could be used for the moderator of even natural uranium  piles   In wartime Germany  failure to appreciate the qualities of very pure graphite led to reactor designs dependent on heavy water  which in turn was denied the Germans by Allied attacks in Norway  where heavy water was produced  These difficulties—among many others— prevented the Nazis from building a nuclear reactor capable of criticality during the war  although they never put as much effort as the United States into nuclear research  focusing on other technologies  see German nuclear energy project for more details    2 3  Manhattan Project and beyond  In the United States  an all out effort for making atomic weapons was begun in late 1942  This work was taken over by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers in 1943  and known as the Manhattan Engineer District  The top secret Manhattan Project  as it was colloquially known  was led by General Leslie R  Groves  Among the project s dozens of sites were  Hanford Site in Washington state  which had the first industrial scale nuclear reactors  Oak Ridge  Tennessee  which was primarily concerned with uranium enrichment  and Los Alamos  in New Mexico  which was the scientific hub for research on bomb development and design  Other sites  notably the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago  played important contributing roles  Overall scientific direction of the project was managed by the physicist J  Robert Oppenheimer   In July 1945  the first atomic bomb  dubbed  Trinity   was detonated in the New Mexico desert  It was fueled by plutonium created at Hanford  In August 1945  two more atomic bombs— Little Boy   a uranium 235 bomb  and  Fat Man   a plutonium bomb—were used against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki   In the years after World War II  many countries were involved in the further development of nuclear fission for the purposes of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons  The UK opened the first commercial nuclear power plant in 1956  In 2013  there are 437 reactors in 31 countries   2 4  Natural fission chain reactors on Earth  Criticality in nature is uncommon  At three ore deposits at Oklo in Gabon  sixteen sites  the so called Oklo Fossil Reactors  have been discovered at which self sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately 2 billion years ago  Unknown until 1972  but postulated by Paul Kuroda in 1956   when French physicist Francis Perrin discovered the Oklo Fossil Reactors  it was realized that nature had beaten humans to the punch  Large scale natural uranium fission chain reactions  moderated by normal water  had occurred far in the past and would not be possible now  This ancient process was able to use normal water as a moderator only because 2 billion years before the present  natural uranium was richer in the shorter lived fissile isotope 235U  about 3%   than natural uranium available today  which is only 0 7%  and must be enriched to 3% to be usable in light water reactors    3  See also  Hybrid fusion fission  Cold fission  Nuclear
