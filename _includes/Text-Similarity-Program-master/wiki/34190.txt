XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System  It was originally written for Unix like operating systems on IBM PC compatibles and is now available for many other operating systems and platforms  It is free and open source software under the XFree86 License version 1 1  It is developed by the XFree86 Project  Inc  The lead developer is David Dawes  The current version is 4 8 0  released December 2008  The last XFree86 CVS commit was made on May 18  2009  the project was confirmed dormant in December 2011   For most of the 1990s and early 2000s  the project was the source of most innovation in X and was the de facto steward of X development  Until early 2004  it was almost universal on Linux and the BSDs   In February 2004  with version 4 4 0  The XFree86 Project adopted a license change that the Free Software Foundation considered GPL incompatible  Most open source operating systems using XFree86 found this unacceptable and moved to a fork from before the license change  The first fork was the abortive Xouvert  but X Org Server soon became dominant  Most XFree86 developers also moved to X Org   1  Usage  While XFree86 was used in most distributions before its license change with version 4 4 0  it has mostly been replaced by its fork X org and is used rarely nowadays  The last remaining operating system distribution to use it is NetBSD  which still ships some platforms with 4 5 0 by default  though Xorg can be installed from pkgsrc    2  Architecture  The XFree86 server communicates with the host operating system s kernel to drive input and output devices  with the exception of graphics cards  These are generally managed directly by XFree86  so it includes its own drivers for all graphic cards a user might have  Some cards are supported by vendors themselves via binary only drivers   Since version 4 0  XFree86 has supported certain accelerated 3D graphics cards via the GLX and DRI extensions  Also in the version 4 0  XFree86 moved to a new driver model  from one X server binary per driver to a unique X server capable of loading several drivers at a time   Because the server usually needs low level access to graphics hardware  on many configurations it needs to run as the superuser  or a user with UID 0  However  on some systems and configurations it is possible to run the server as a normal user   It is also possible to use XFree86 in a framebuffer device  which in turn uses a kernel graphics card driver   On a typical POSIX system  the directory  etc X11 includes the configuration files  The basic configuration file is  etc X11 XF86Config  or XF86Config 4  that includes variables about the screen  monitor   keyboard and graphics card  The program xf86config is often used  although xf86cfg also comes with the XFree86 server and is certainly friendlier  Many Linux distributions used to include a configuration tool that was easier to use  such as Debian s debconf  or autodetected most  if not all  settings  Red Hat Linux and Fedora s Anaconda  SuSE s YaST and Mandrake Linux used to choose this path    3  History  3 1  Early history and naming  The project began in 1992 when David Wexelblat  Glenn Lai  David Dawes and Jim Tsillas joined forces addressing bugs in the source code of the X386 X display server  written by Thomas Roell   as contributed to X11R5  This version was initially called X386 1 2E  As newer versions of the  originally freeware  X386 were being sold under a proprietary software license by SGCS  of which Roell was a partner   confusion existed between the projects  After discussion  the project was renamed XFree86  as a pun  compare X three eighty six to X free eighty six   Roell has continued to sell proprietary X servers  most recently under the name Accelerated X   3 2  Rise with Linux  As Linux grew in popularity  XFree86 rose with it  as the main X project with drivers for PC video cards   By the late 1990s  official X development was moribund  Most technical advancement was happening in the XFree86 project  In 1999  XFree86 was sponsored onto X Org  the official industry consortium  by various hardware companies interested in its use with Linux and its status as the most popular version of X   3 3  2002  growing dissent within the project  By 2002  while Linux s popularity  and hence the installed base of X  surged  X Org was all but inactive  active development was largely carried out by XFree86  However  there was considerable dissent within XFree86   XFree86 used to have a Core Team which was made up of experienced developers  selected by other Core Team members for their merits  Only the members of this Core Team were allowed to commit to CVS  This was perceived as far too cathedral like in its development model  developers were unable to get commit rights quickly and vendors ended up maintaining extensive patches   A key event was Keith Packard losing his commit rights  Hours before the feature freeze window for XFree86 4 3 0 started  he committed the XFIXES extension  without prior discussion or without review within the Core Team  The Core Team decided to remove Keith s commit access  but without removing him from the Core Team itself  and the XFIXES extension was backed out 6 weeks later   3 4  2003  The fork and the disbanding of the Core Team  In March  the Core Team claimed that Keith Packard had been trying to fork the XFree86 project by working inside the project while trying to attract core developers to a new X Server project of his own making  Packard denied this had been his aim  but some emails were provided as evidence otherwise  Keith Packard was subsequently expelled from the Core Team   A short time later  Keith Packard created xwin org  which mainly served as a meeting point for cultivating the XFree86 fork  The rest of the year  many of the developers that were still active at XFree86 went over to the project that was being set up at the freedesktop org and X org domains   By the end of the year  due to dwindling active membership and limited remaining development capacity  the XFree86 Core Team voted to disband itself   3 5  2004  Licensing controversy  Versions of XFree86 up to and including some release candidates for 4 4 0 were under the MIT License  a permissive  non copyleft free software license  In February 2004  XFree86 4 4 was released with a change to the XFree86 license  by adding a credit clause  similar to that in the original BSD license  but broader in scope  The newer terms are referred to as the XFree86 License 1 1  Many projects relying on XFree86 found the new license unacceptable  and the Free Software Foundation considers it incompatible with the version 2 of the GNU General Public License  though compatible with version 3  The XFree86 Project states that the license is  as GPL compatible as any and all previous versions were   but does not mention which version or versions of the GPL this is valid for   Some projects made releases  notably OpenBSD 3 5 and 3 6  and Debian 3 1  Sarge   based on XFree86 version 4 4 RC2  the last version under the old license  Most operating systems incorporating XFree86  including later versions of OpenBSD and Debian  migrated to the X Org Server   The last code commit was in 2009  the project was confirmed dormant in 2011   4  Forks of XFree86  4 1  Xwin  Shortly after he was expelled from the XFree86 Core Team  Keith Packard started setting up xwin org  While this was claimed to be the fork of XFree86  Keith Packard later refined this to  a forum for community participation in X   Xwin saw a lot of activity in the first two months after the announcements  but most of the activity was happening behind the scenes  and Keith moved his own development to freedesktop org   4 2  Xouvert  Xouvert was later also hailed as the first XFree86 fork in August 2003  Even though releases were announced for October 2003 and April 2004  no releases were made  The last status change was made in March 2004 and it was communicated that there were delays in setting up a revision control system   4 3  X Org  The X Org Server became the official reference implementation of X11  The first version  X11R6 7 0  was forked from XFree86 version 4 4 RC2 to avoid the XFree86 license changes  with X11R6 6 changes merged in  Version X11R6 8 added many new extensions  drivers and fixes  It is hosted by and works closely with corporate sponsored freedesktop org   Most of the open source Unix like operating systems have adopted the X Org Server in place of XFree86  and most of the XFree86 developers have moved to X Org   5  Release history  6  See also  DirectFB  XFree86 logfile  XFree86 Modeline  XF86Config  7  References   Notes   Oscar Boykin  OSNews February 25  2004  舒 the licensing
