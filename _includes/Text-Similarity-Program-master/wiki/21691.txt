Nightclub Two Step  Nightclub Two step  NC2S  sometimes Disco Two Step or California Two Step  was initially developed by Buddy Schwimmer in the mid 1960s  The dance is also known as  Two Step  and was  one of the most popular forms of contemporary social dance  as a Disco Couples Dance in 1978  It is frequently danced to mid tempo ballads in 4 4 time that have a characteristic Quick Quick Slow beat  A classic example is the song Lady In Red   1  Description  The Nightclub Two Step basic step can be counted as One & Two   Three & Four     The dance position for Nightclub Two Step is with a more relaxed hold  or  what people tend to do without lessons   The lead rocks back on their left foot  the follow on their right  for one beat   The toe is to the heel  but not further  Don t twist your hip  If your hip opens up  you have gone too far   A gentle but noticeable resistance is maintained during the rock step  Then both partners replace weight on the second part of the first beat  On the next beat  the lead takes a step to the left and the follow to the right  Then both partners repeat  but on opposite feet  the lead rocks back on their right foot and moves to the right    The quick rock steps should be matched with the quick drum beats in the music  The  slow  drum beat and slow step can occur on either the second and fourth  or the first and third beats of a measure  Although other rhythmic interpretations of the music are possible  including the use of  breaks  in the music  they are beyond the scope of this article   Side cross side  Another pattern in NC2S is the side cross side move  Typically  the lead starts this move by stepping side with their left foot and then crosses in front with their right foot  This is followed by another step to the side with the left foot  The rhythm  here  is Quick  Quick  Slow  The follow does the same thing  but starts with their right foot  Both partners cross in front  In an interview with Phil Seyer Buddy said he created this move by modifying something that was popular in the 60 s called the  Surfer Stomp   The surfer stomp was simply  side  together  side  touch  In the DVIDA Nightclub Two Step syllabus  this action is called a Traveling Cross   2  References  3  External links
