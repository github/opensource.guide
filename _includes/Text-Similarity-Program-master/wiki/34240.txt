Ytterbium is a chemical element with symbol Yb and atomic number 70  It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series  or last element in the f block  which is the basis of the relative stability of the +2 oxidation state  However  like the other lanthanides  the most common oxidation state is +3  seen in its oxide  halides and other compounds  In aqueous solution  like compounds of other late lanthanides  soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules  Because of its closed shell electron configuration  its density and melting and boiling points differ from those of the other lanthanides   In 1878  the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated in the rare earth  erbia  another independent component  which he called  ytterbia   for Ytterby  the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium  He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called  ytterbium   in total  four elements were named after the village  the others being yttrium  terbium and erbium   In 1907  the new earth  lutecia  was separated from ytterbia  from which the element  lutecium   now lutetium  was extracted by Georges Urbain  Carl Auer von Welsbach  and Charles James  After some discussion  Marignac s name  ytterbium  was retained  A relatively pure sample of the metal was obtained only in 1953  At present  ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media  and less often as a gamma ray source   Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes  which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million  This element is mined in China  the United States  Brazil  and India in form of the minerals monazite  euxenite  and xenotime  The ytterbium concentration is low  because the element is found among many other rare earth elements  moreover  it is among the least abundant ones  Once extracted and prepared  ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant  The metal is a fire and explosion hazard   1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  Ytterbium is a soft  malleable and ductile chemical element that displays a bright silvery luster when in its pure form  It is a rare earth element  and it is readily attacked and dissolved by the strong mineral acids  It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air   Ytterbium has three allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha  beta and gamma  their transformation temperatures are −13 °C and 795 °C  although the exact transformation temperature depends on the pressure and stress  The beta allotrope exists at room temperature  and it has a face centered cubic crystal structure  The high temperature gamma allotrope has a body centered cubic crystalline structure  The alpha allotrope has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures  Normally  the beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity  but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16 000 atmospheres  1 6 GPa   Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39 000 atmospheres  3 9 GPa   but then drops to about 10% of its room temperature resistivity at about 40 000 atm  4 0 GPa    In contrast with the other rare earth metals  which usually have antiferromagnetic and or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures  ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1 0 kelvin  However  the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic  With a melting point of 824 °C and a boiling point of 1196 °C  ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals   Contrary to most other lanthanides  which have a close packed hexagonal lattice  ytterbium crystallizes in the face centered cubic structure  As a result  its density  6 973 g cm3  is significantly lower than  e g   those of the neighboring elements thulium  9 32 g cm3  and lutetium  9 841 g cm3   The melting and boiling points of ytterbium are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium  These properties stem from the closed shell electron configuration of ytterbium   Xe  4f14 6s2   which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding  in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available    1 2  Chemical properties  Ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air  Finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen  Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald green flame  Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non stoichiometric hydrides  Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water  but quickly in acids  liberating hydrogen gas   Ytterbium is quite electropositive  and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium III  hydroxide   Ytterbium reacts with all the halogens   The ytterbium III  ion absorbs light in the near infrared range of wavelengths  but not in visible light  so the mineral ytterbia  Yb2O3  is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless  Ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the colorless Yb III  ions  which exist as nonahydrate complexes   1 3  Yb II  vs  Yb III   Although usually trivalent  ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds  This behavior is unusual to most lanthanides  which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3  The +2 state has a valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f shell gives more stability  The yellow green ytterbium II  ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water  releasing hydrogen gas  and thus only the colorless ytterbium III  ion occurs in aqueous solution  Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state  but europium II  is stable in aqueous solution  Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals  dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts   1 4  Isotopes  Natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable isotopes  168Yb  170Yb  171Yb  172Yb  173Yb  174Yb  and 176Yb  with 174Yb being the most abundant isotope  at 31 8% of the natural abundance   27 radioisotopes have been observed  with the most stable ones being 169Yb with a half life of 32 0 days  175Yb with a half life of 4 18 days  and 166Yb with a half life of 56 7 hours  All of its remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than two hours and most of these have half lives are less than 20 minutes  Ytterbium also has 12 meta states  with the most stable being 169mYb  t1 2 46 seconds    The isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 147 9674 atomic mass unit  u  for 148Yb to 180 9562 u for 181Yb  The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope  174Yb  is electron capture  and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay  The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes  and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes   2  Occurrence  Ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals  It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand  0 03% ytterbium   The element is also found in euxenite and xenotime  The main mining areas are China  the United States  Brazil  India  Sri Lanka  and Australia  and reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes  Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths  but ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid  to late 20th century have simplified separation  Known compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized  The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth s crust is about 3 mg kg   As an even numbered lanthanide  in accordance with the Oddo Harkins rule  ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors  thulium and lutetium  which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0 5% each  The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year  reflecting the fact that ytterbium has few commercial applications  Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the Yb YAG laser  a solid state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation   3  Production  It is somewhat difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties  As a result  the process is somewhat long  First  minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids  such as sulfuric acid  Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange  as can other lanthanides  The solution is then applied to a resin  which different lanthanides bond to in different matters  This is then dissolved using complexing agents  and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides  it is possible to isolate the compounds   Ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam  In the latter method  a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium mercury alloy  which reduces and dissolves Yb3+  The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid  The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating  The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum  aluminium  cerium or zirconium in high vacuum  The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate   4  Compounds  The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides  Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless  Like europium  samarium  and thulium  the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced by hydrogen  zinc dust  or by the addition of metallic ytterbium to the dihalides  The +2 oxidation state only occurs in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds  for example  ytterbium II  oxide  YbO  shows the same structure as calcium oxide  CaO    4 1  Halides  Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine  chlorine  bromine  and iodine  The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature   Some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis  For example  ytterbium III  chloride  YbCl3  is a Lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions  Ytterbium II  iodide  YbI2  may be used  like samarium II  iodide  as a reducing agent for coupling reactions  Ytterbium III  fluoride  YbF3  is used as an inert and non toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions  which are good for dental health  and is also a good X ray contrast agent   4 2  Oxides  Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium III  oxide  Yb2O3   which crystallizes in the  rare earth C type sesquioxide  structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed  leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate  non octahedral  environments  Ytterbium III  oxide can be reduced to ytterbium II  oxide  YbO  with elemental ytterbium  which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride   5  History  Ytterbium was discovered by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878  While examining samples of gadolinite  Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia  and he named it ytterbia  for Ytterby  the Swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium  Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called  ytterbium    In 1907  the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac s ytterbia into two components  neoytterbia and lutecia  Neoytterbia would later become known as the element ytterbium  and lutecia would later be known as the element lutetium  The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time  but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium  the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time  Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party  The Commission on Atomic Mass  consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke  Wilhelm Ostwald  and Georges Urbain  which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names  settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones  based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac s ytterbium was first described by Urbain  after Urbain s names were recognized  neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium   The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until 1953  when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion exchange processes  The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US$1 000 kg   6  Applications  6 1  Source of gamma rays  The 169Yb isotope  with a half life of 32 days   which is created along with the short lived 175Yb isotope  half life 4 2 days  by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors  has been used as a radiation source in portable X ray machines  Like X rays  the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body  but are blocked by bones and other dense materials  Thus  small 169Yb samples  which emit gamma rays  act like tiny X ray machines useful for radiography of small objects  Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X rays having energies between 250 and 350 keV  169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine   6 2  World s most stable atomic clock  Ytterbium clocks hold the record for stability with ticks stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion     The clocks developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  rely on about 10 000 rare earth atoms cooled to 10 microkelvin  10 millionths of a degree above absolute zero  and trapped in an optical lattice—a series of pancake shaped wells made of laser light  Another laser that  ticks  518 trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms  The large number of atoms is key to the clocks  high stability   6 3  Doping of stainless steel  Ytterbium can also be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement  strength  and other mechanical properties of stainless steel  Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry   6 4  Ytterbium as dopant of active media  The ytterbium +3 ion is used as a doping material in active laser media  specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers  Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient  have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses  ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser  Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1 06–1 12 µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900 nm–1 µm  dependently on the host and application  The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling   The kinetic of excitations in ytterbium doped materials is simple and can be described within the concept of effective cross sections  for most ytterbium doped laser materials  as for many other optically pumped gain media   the McCumber relation holds  although the application to the ytterbium doped composite materials was under discussion   Usually  low concentrations of ytterbium are used  At high concentrations  the ytterbium doped materials show photodarkening  glass fibers  or even a switch to broadband emission  crystals and ceramics  instead of efficient laser action  This effect may be related with not only overheating  but also with conditions of charge compensation at high concentrations of ytterbium ions   Much progress has been made in the power scaling Lasers and Amplifiers produced with ytterbium  Yb  doped optical fibers  Power levels have increased from the 1 kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb doped fibers themselves  Fabrication of Low NA  Large Mode Area  LMA  fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities  M2 1 1  at power levels of 1 5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration  Ytterbium doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter  MFD  which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillion scattering  SBS  and stimulated Raman scattering  SRS   which limit the achievement of higher power levels  and provides a distinct advantage over single mode Yb doped fibers   In order to achieve even higher power levels in Yb based fiber systems all factors of the fiber must be considered  These can only be achieved via optimization of all the Yb fiber parameters  ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties  in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity   Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity  The optimization of the Yb doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass  improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber and improved photodarkening performance  All of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems   6 5  Others  Ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistivity when subjected to high stresses  This property is used in stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions   Light waves vibrate faster than microwaves  and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than caesium atomic clocks  The Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt  PTB  is working on several such optical clocks  The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate  The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point  A pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  has set a new record for stability  NIST physicists report in the Aug  22  2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks  ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion  1 followed by 18 zeros   roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks  The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable to the age of the universe   Currently  ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares  As ytterbium III  oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide  a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium Teflon Viton  MTV    7  Precautions  Although ytterbium is fairly stable chemically  it is stored in airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen filled dry box to protect the metal from air and moisture  All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic  although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal  Ytterbium compounds are  however  known to cause irritation to the human skin and eyes  and some might be teratogenic  Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust  and the resulting fumes are hazardous  Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water  and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires   8  References  9  Further reading  Guide to the Elements – Revised Edition  Albert Stwertka
