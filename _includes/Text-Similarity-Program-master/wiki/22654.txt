The Ohio class is a class of nuclear powered submarines used by the United States Navy  The navy has 18 Ohio class submarines  14 ballistic missile submarines  SSBN  and four that were later converted to guided missile submarines  SSGN    The Ohio class is named after the lead submarine of this class    The 14 Trident II SSBNs together carry approximately fifty percent of the total US active inventory of strategic thermonuclear warheads  The exact number of warheads deployed across the world varies in an unpredictable and classified manner  but always at or below a maximum number set by various Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties  Although the Trident missiles have no pre set targets when the submarines go on patrol  the warships  when required  are capable of quickly being assigned targets by using secure and constant radio communications links at sea  including very low frequency  VLF  systems   All the Ohio class submarines  except for   are named for U S  states  which until that point was a tradition reserved for battleships and cruisers   The Ohio class submarines are the largest submarines ever built for the U S  Navy  Two classes of the Russian Navy s submarines have larger total displacements  the Soviet designed s have more than twice the total displacement  and Russia s s have roughly 25 percent greater displacement  but the Ohio class warships carry more missiles than either of the other designs  24 Trident missiles per boat  versus 16 missiles for the Borei class  20 for the Borei II  and 20 for the Typhoon class   1  Description  The Ohio class submarines were designed specifically for extended war deterrence patrols  Each of these submarines is provided with two complete crews  called the Blue crew and the Gold crew  with each crew serving typically on 70  to 90 day deterrent patrols  To decrease the time in port for crew turnover and replenishment  three large logistics hatches have been installed to provide large diameter resupply and repair access  These hatches allow rapid transfer of supply pallets  equipment replacement modules  and machinery components  significantly reducing the time required for replenishment and maintenance of the submarines   The class s design allows the warship to operate for about fifteen years between major overhauls  These submarines are reported to be as quiet at their cruising speed of or more than the previous s were at   although exact information remains classified  Fire control for their Mark 48 torpedoes is carried out by Mark 118 Mod 2 system  while the Missile Fire Control  MFC  system is a Mark 98   The Ohio class submarines were constructed from sections of hull  with each four deck section being in diameter  The sections were produced at the General Dynamics Electric Boat facility  Quonset Point  Rhode Island  and then assembled at its shipyard at Groton  Connecticut   The US Navy has a total of 18 Ohio class submarines which consist of 14 ballistic missile submarines  SSBNs   and four cruise missile submarines  SSGNs   The SSBN submarines are also known as  Trident  submarines  and provide the sea based leg of the U S  nuclear triad  Each SSBN submarine is armed with up to 24 Trident II submarine launched ballistic missiles  SLBM   Each SSGN is capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles with either conventional or nuclear warheads  plus a complement of Harpoon missiles to be fired through their torpedo tubes   2  History  The first eight Ohio class submarines were armed at first with 24 Trident I C4 SLBMs  Beginning with the ninth Trident submarine    the remaining boats were equipped with the larger  three stage Trident II D5 missile  The Trident II missile carries eight multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles  MIRV   in total delivering more destructive power than the Trident I missile and with greater accuracy  Starting with in 2000  the Navy began converting its remaining ballistic missile submarines armed with C4 missiles to carry D5 missiles  This task was completed in mid 2008   The first eight submarines had their home ports at Bangor  Washington  to replace the submarines carrying the Polaris A3 missile that were then being decommissioned  The remaining ten submarines originally had their home ports at Kings Bay  Georgia  replacing the Poseidon and Trident Backfit submarines of the Atlantic Fleet  During the conversion of the first four submarines to SSGNs  see below   five of the submarines          and   were transferred from Kings Bay to Bangor  Further transfers occur as the strategic weapons goals of the United States change   In 2011  Ohio class submarines carried out 28 deterrent patrols  Each patrol lasts around 70 days  Four boats are on station   hard alert   in designated patrol areas at any given time  From August to December 2010  Maine carried out a 105 day long patrol  the longest to date   2 1  SSBN SSGN conversions  After the end of the Cold War  plans called for to be retired in 2002  followed by three of her sister boats  However  Ohio      and instead were slated for modification  to remain in service carrying conventionally armed guided missiles  and were redesignated as SSGNs   Beginning in 2002 through 2010  22 of the 24 diameter Trident missile tubes were modified to contain large vertical launch systems  VLS   one configuration of which may be a cluster of seven Tomahawk cruise missiles  In this configuration  the number of cruise missiles carried could be a maximum of 154  the equivalent of what is typically deployed in a surface battle group  Other payload possibilities include new generations of supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles  and Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles  SLIRBM   unmanned air vehicles  UAVs   the ADM 160 MALD  sensors for anti submarine warfare or intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance missions  countermine warfare payloads such as the AN BLQ 11 Long Term Mine Reconnaissance System  LMRS   and the broaching universal buoyant launcher  BUBL  and stealthy affordable capsule system  SACS  specialized payload canisters   The missile tubes also have room for stowage canisters that can extend the forward deployment time for special forces  The other two Trident tubes are converted to swimmer lockout chambers  For special operations  the Advanced SEAL Delivery System and the Dry Deck Shelter can be mounted on the lockout chamber and the boat will be able to host up to 66 special operations sailors or Marines  such as Navy SEALs  or USMC MARSOC teams  Improved communications equipment installed during the upgrade allows the SSGNs to serve as a forward deployed  clandestine Small Combatant Joint Command Center   On 26 September 2002  the Navy awarded the Electric Boat company a US$442 9 million contract to begin the first phase of the SSGN submarine conversion program  Those funds covered only the initial phase of conversion for the first two boats on the schedule  Advanced procurement was funded at $355 million in fiscal year 2002  $825 million in the FY 2003 budget and  through the five year defense budget plan  at $936 million in FY 2004  $505 million in FY 2005  and $170 million in FY 2006  Thus  the total cost to refit the four boats is just under $700 million per vessel   In November 2002  Ohio entered a drydock  beginning her 36 month refueling and missile conversion overhaul  Electric Boat announced on 9 January 2006 that the conversion had been completed  The converted Ohio rejoined the fleet in February 2006  followed by the Florida in April 2006  The converted Michigan was delivered in November 2006  The converted Ohio went to sea for the first time in October 2007  Georgia returned to the fleet in March 2008 at Kings Bay  These four SSGNs are expected to remain in service until about 2023–2026  At that point their capabilities will be replaced with Virginia Payload Module equipped s   3  Replacement  The U S  Department of Defense anticipates a continued need for a sea based strategic nuclear force  The first of the current Ohio SSBNs are expected to be retired by 2029  meaning that a platform must already be seaworthy by that time  A replacement may cost over $4 billion per unit compared to Ohios $2 billion  The U S  Navy is exploring two options  The first is a variant of the nuclear attack submarines  The second is a dedicated SSBN  either with a new hull or based on an overhaul of the current Ohio   With the cooperation of both Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding  in 2007  the U S  Navy began a cost control study  Then in December 2008 the U S  Navy awarded Electric Boat a contract for the missile compartment design of the Ohio class replacement  worth up to $592 million  Newport News is expected to receive close to 4% of that project  The U S  Navy has yet to confirm an Ohio class replacement program  However  in April 2009  U S  Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates confirmed that the U S  Navy should begin such a program in 2010  The new vessel is scheduled to enter the design phase by 2014  It is anticipated that  if a new hull design is used  the program must be initiated by 2016 in order to meet the 2029 deadline   4  In popular culture  As ballistic missile submarines  the Ohio class has occasionally been portrayed in fiction books and films   The fictional USS Montana is featured in the James Cameron 1989 undersea adventure The Abyss   is the setting for the 1995 submarine film  Crimson Tide   The fictional ballistic missile submarine  USS Colorado  SSBN 753   is the primary setting for the ABC television series Last Resort   The then fictional USS Alaska was the setting for the 1980 novel The Gold Crew by Thomas N  Scortia and Frank M  Robinson   USS Maine plays a major role in Tom Clancy s novel The Sum of All Fears   5  See also  List of Ohio class submarines  Yankee Notch – 1983 conversion of former Soviet SSBN class to take up to 40
