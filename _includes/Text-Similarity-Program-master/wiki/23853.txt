Pope Honorius II  died 13 February 1130   born Lamberto Scannabecchi  was Pope from 21 December 1124 to his death in 1130   Although from a humble background  his obvious intellect and outstanding abilities saw him promoted up through the ecclesiastical hierarchy  Attached to the Frangipani family of Rome  his election as pope was contested by a rival candidate  Celestine II  and force was used to guarantee his election   Honorius  pontificate was concerned with ensuring that the privileges the Roman Catholic Church had obtained through the Concordat of Worms were preserved and  if possible  extended  He was the first pope to confirm the election of the Holy Roman Emperor  Distrustful of the traditional Benedictine order  he favoured new monastic orders  such as the Augustinians and the Cistercians  and sought to exercise more control over the larger monastic centres of Monte Cassino and Cluny Abbey  He also approved the new military order of the Knights Templar in 1128   Honorius II failed to prevent Roger II of Sicily from extending his power in southern Italy and was unable to stop Louis VI of France from interfering in the affairs of the French church  Like his predecessors  he managed the wide ranging affairs of the church through Papal Legates  With his death in 1130  the Church was again thrown into confusion with the election of two rival popes  Innocent II and the antipope Anacletus II   1  Early life  Lamberto was of simple rural origins  hailing from Fiagnano in the Casalfiumanese commune  near Imola in present day Italy  Entering into an ecclesiastical career  he soon became archdeacon of Bologna  where his abilities eventually saw him attract the attention of Pope Urban II  who presumably appointed him cardinal priest of the Titulus St  Praxedis in 1099  His successor  Pope Paschal II  made Lamberto a Canon of the Lateran before elevating him to the position of cardinal bishop of Ostia in 1117  Lamberto was one of the cardinals who accompanied Pope Gelasius II into exile in 1118–19 and was at his bedside when Gelasius died   With Gelasius’ death  Lamberto became a close advisor of Pope Callixtus II  Accompanying Callixtus throughout France  he assisted Callixtus in his initial dealings with Holy Roman Emperor Henry V  As a well known opponent of the emperor s right to select bishops in his territories  the Investiture Controversy   Lamberto was a natural choice for papal legate  He was sent in 1119 to deal with Henry V and delegated with powers to come to an understanding concerning the right of investiture   Forceful and determined  he summoned the bishops of the Holy Roman Empire to attend an assembly at Mainz on 8 September 1122  He expected absolute obedience  so much so that it took the mediation of Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz to prevent the suspension of Saint Otto of Bamberg for non attendance  The struggle came to a conclusion with the Concordat of Worms in 1122 and the  Pactum Calixtinum  that was almost entirely due to Lamberto s efforts was effected on 23 September 1123   2  Pontificate  2 1  Conclave of 1124  Pressures building within the Curia  together with ongoing conflicts among the Roman nobility  would erupt after the death of Callixtus II in 1124  The pontificates of Urban II and Paschal II saw an expansion in the College of Cardinals of Italian clerics that strengthened the local Roman influence  These cardinals were reluctant to meet with the batch of cardinals recently promoted by Callixtus II  who were mainly French or Burgundian  As far as the older cardinals were concerned  these newer cardinals were dangerous innovators  and they were determined to resist their increasing influence  The northern cardinals  led by Cardinal Aymeric de Borgogne  the Papal Chancellor   were equally determined to ensure that the elected pope would be one of their candidates  Both groups looked towards the great Roman families for support   By 1124  there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome  the Frangipani family  which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals  and the Pierleoni family  which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals  With Callixtus II’s death on 13 December 1124  both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time  in accordance with the church canons  The Frangipani  led by Leo Frangipani  pushed for the delay in order that they could promote their preferred candidate  Lamberto  but the people were eager to see Saxo de Anagni  the Cardinal Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte elected as the next pope  Leo  eager to ensure a valid election  approached key members of every Cardinal’s entourage  promising each one that he would support their master when the voting for the election was underway   On 16 December  all the Cardinals  including Lamberto  assembled in the chapel of the monastery of St  Pancratius attached to the south of the Lateran basilica  There  at the suggestion of Jonathas  the Cardinal Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano  who was a partisan of the Pierleoni family  the Cardinals unanimously elected as Pope the Cardinal Priest of Sant’ Anastasia  Theobaldo Boccapecci  who took the name Celestine II  He had only just put on the red mantle and the Te Deum was being sung when an armed party of Frangipani supporters  in a move pre arranged with Cardinal Aymeric  burst in  attacked the newly enthroned Celestine  who was wounded  and acclaimed Lamberto as Pope  Since Celestine had not been formally consecrated pope  the wounded candidate declared himself willing to resign  but the Pierleoni family and their supporters refused to accept Lamberto  who in the confusion had been proclaimed Pope under the name Honorius II   Rome descended into factional infighting  while Cardinal Aymeric and Leo Frangipani attempted to win over the resistance of Urban  the City Prefect  and the Pierleoni family with bribes and extravagant promises  Eventually  Celestine’s supporters abandoned him  leaving Honorius the only contender for the papal throne  Honorius  unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner  resigned his position before all of the assembled Cardinals  but was immediately and unanimously re elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124   3  Papacy  3 1  Relations with the Holy Roman Empire  Honorius immediately came into conflict with Emperor Henry V over imperial claims in Italy  In 1116  Henry had crossed the Alps to lay claim to the Italian territories of Matilda of Tuscany  which she had supposedly left to the papacy on her death  Henry had immediately begun appointing imperial vicars throughout the newly acquired province over the objections of both the Tuscan cities and the papacy  To maintain papal claims to Tuscany  Honorius appointed Albert  a papal marquis  to rule in the pope’s name in opposition to the imperial Margrave of Tuscany  Conrad von Scheiern  In addition  Henry V made very little effort to implement the terms of the Concordant of Worms  to Honorius II’s irritation  Local churches were forced to appeal to Rome to obtain restitution from the imperial bishops who had taken advantage of the Investiture Controversy to obtain property for their own benefit  as the Emperor turned a blind eye   The death of Emperor Henry V on 23 May 1125 put an end to these squabbles  but soon Honorius was involved in a new power struggle in the Holy Roman Empire  Henry died childless and had nominated his nephew Frederick Hohenstaufen  Duke of Swabia  to succeed him as King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor  Of the German princes  the ecclesiastical faction was against any expansion of Hohenstaufen power  and they were determined to ensure that Frederick would not succeed Henry  Led by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz  the Archchancellor of the empire  and under the watchful gaze of two papal legates  Cardinals Gherardo and Romano  the clerical and lay nobles of the empire elected Lothair of Supplinburg  Duke of Saxony  At Lothair’s request  Cardinal Gherardo and two bishops then sent word to Rome to obtain Honorius’ confirmation of the election  which he granted  This was a coup for Honorius  as such a confirmation had never occurred before  and around July 1126 Honorius invited Emperor Lothair to Rome to obtain the imperial title  Lothair was keen to keep Honorius on his side  keeping to the terms of the Concordat of Worms by not attending episcopal elections  agreeing that the investiture should only occur after the bishop’s consecration  and that the oath of homage be replaced with an oath of fidelity   Lothair was unable to visit Rome immediately as Germany was rocked by the rebellion of the Hohenstaufen brothers  with Conrad Hohenstaufen elected anti king in December 1127  followed by his descent into Italy and his crowning as King of Italy at Monza on 29 July 1128  The German bishops  again led by Adalbert of Mainz  excommunicated Conrad  an act that was confirmed by Honorius in a synod held in Rome at Easter  22 April 1128   Honorius also sent Cardinal John of Crema to Pisa to hold another synod that excommunicated Archbishop Anselm of Milan  who had crowned Conrad king  Conrad found little help in Italy and with Honorius’ support  Lothair was able to keep his throne   One of the key ecclesiastical advisors of Lothair III was Saint Norbert of Xanten  who travelled to Rome in early 1126 to seek the formal sanction from Honorius to establish a new monastic order  the Premonstratensian Order  also known as the Norbertines   which Honorius agreed to do   3 2  Concerns in Campania  One of Honorius’ first tasks in southern Italy was to deal with the barons in the Campania who were molesting farmers and travellers at will with their armed bands  In 1125  papal force brought to heel the lords of Ceccano  Papal armies took possession of various towns  including Maenza  Roccasecca and Trevi nel Lazio  In 1128  Honorius’ forces successfully captured the town of Segni  which was also held by a local baron who died during its capture  Honorius  however  was most concerned about the former papal stronghold at Fumone  which the nobles  who held it in the pope’s name  had decided to keep possession of  The town fell in July 1125 after a siege of ten weeks  When Honorius took possession of Fumone  he returned it  after taking safeguards  to its rebellious custodians and ordered that the Antipope Gregory VIII be transferred there from his previous lodgings at Monte Cassino  With that  Honorius turned his attention to the powerful and independent minded abbot of Monte Cassino  Oderisio di Sangro   Honorius had a long standing dislike of Oderisio going back to the time when Honorius was cardinal bishop of Ostia  Honorius had asked for permission from the abbot to allow him and his entourage permission to stay in the church of Santa Maria in Pallara  which was a traditional privilege belonging to the bishops of Ostia  Oderisio refused  and Honorius never forgot the insult  These bad feelings were compounded in 1125  when Oderisio refused a request from Pope Honorius for some financial assistance after he had been enthroned  Oderisio also mocked Honorius’ peasant background behind his back   Using reports that the abbot had been lining his own pockets rather than spending it on his monastery  Honorius publicly denounced Oderisio  calling him a soldier and a thief  not a monk  When Atenulf  count of Aquino  brought accusations that Oderisio was aiming for the papacy  Honorius summoned Oderisio to Rome to answer the charges  Three times Oderisio refused to answer the summons and so during Lent of 1126  Honorius deposed the abbot  Oderisio refused to accept the deposition and continued to act as abbot  forcing Honorius to excommunicate him  Oderisio fortified the monastery  as the people of the town of Cassino forcibly entered the monastery  and after an armed struggle forced the monks to declare Oderisio deposed and to elect another abbot in his place  The monks elected Niccolo  the dean of the monastery   Determined to bring the Benedictines to heel  Honorius insisted that the election of Niccolo was uncanonical  and demanded that Seniorectus  the provost of the monastery at Capua  be elected as abbot  to the fury of the Monte Cassino monks  In the meantime  open warfare was being waged between the supporters of Oderisio and Niccolo  Eventually  however  Honorius was able to secure not only the resignation of Oderisio  but he also excommunicated Niccolo for good measure  He reassured the monks of his intentions  and in September 1127  he personally installed Seniorectus as abbot  Honorius also insisted that the monks take an oath of fidelity to the papacy  but they strenuously objected   3 3  Conflict with Roger II of Sicily  Matters to the south of Monte Cassino soon occupied Honorius’ attention  In July 1127  William II  Duke of Apulia  died childless  and almost immediately his cousin King Roger II of Sicily sailed to the mainland to occupy the duchies of Apulia and Calabria  Roger claimed that William had nominated him his heir  while Honorius stated that William had left his territory to the Holy See  Honorius had just suffered a defeat at the hands of a local baron at Arpino in 1127 when Honorius received word that Roger had landed in Italy  He rushed to Benevento to prevent the local Normans from reaching an agreement with Roger  Roger in the meantime had rapidly overrun the duchy of Apulia and had sent Honorius lavish gifts  asking the Pope to recognise him as the new duke and promising to hand over Troia and Montefusco in exchange  Honorius  fearing the expansion of Norman power to the south under one dominating ruler  threatened to excommunicate Roger if he persisted  In the meantime  many of the local Norman nobles  fearful of Roger’s power  allied themselves with Honorius  as Honorius formally excommunicated Roger in November 1127  Roger left his armies threatening Benevento  while he returned to Sicily for reinforcements  Honorius in the meantime entered into an alliance with the new Prince of Capua  Robert II  On 30 December 1127  Honorius preached a crusade against Roger II after having anointed Robert as Prince of Capua   Roger returned in May 1128 and continued to harass papal strongholds while avoiding any direct confrontation with Honorius’ forces  In July 1128  the two armies came in contact with each other on the banks of the Bradano  but Roger refused to engage  believing that the papal armies would soon fall apart  and soon enough some of the Pope’s allies began deserting to Roger  Trying to salvage something of the situation  Honorius sent his trusted advisor Cardinal Aymeric together with Cencio II Frangipane to negotiate with Roger secretly  Honorius agreed to invest Roger with the duchy of Apulia in exchange for an oath of faith and homage by Roger   Honorius travelled to Benevento  and after safeguarding the interests of Robert of Capua  he met Roger on the Pons Major  the bridge which crosses the Sabbato river near Benevento  on 22 August 1128  There  he formally invested Roger with the duchy of Apulia and both agreed to a peace between the Kingdom of Sicily and the Papal States  Unfortunately  Honorius had just returned to Rome when he was informed that the nobles of Benevento had overthrown and killed the rector  or papal governor  of the city and established a Commune  Furious  he declared he would wreak a terrible vengeance on the city  whereupon the residents asked Honorius for forgiveness and to send another governor  Honorius sent Cardinal Gherardo as the new rector  and in 1129 visited the city again  asking that the city allow the return of those they had banished during the formation of the Commune  They refused  and Honorius asked Roger II of Sicily to punish the city in May 1130  but Honorius died before action was taken   3 4  Intervention in France  Aside from the Benedictines at Monte Cassino  Honorius was also determined to deal with the monks at Cluny Abbey under their ambitious and worldly abbot  Pons of Melgueil  He had just returned from the Levant after being forced out by his monks in 1122  In 1125  accompanied by an armed following  Pons took possession of Cluny Abbey  melted down the treasures stored in the monastery  and paid his followers  who continued to terrorise the monks and the villages dependent upon the abbey   Honorius  on hearing news of the disorders at Cluny  sent a legate to investigate with orders to excommunicate and denounce Pons and order him to present himself before Honorius  Pons eventually obeyed the summons  and was deposed by Honorius in 1126 before being imprisoned in the Septizodium  where he soon died  Honorius personally reinvested Peter the Venerable as Abbot of Cluny   Honorius soon became involved in the quarrel between King Louis VI of France and the French bishops  Stephen of Senlis  the Bishop of Paris  had been heavily influenced by the reforming zeal of Bernard of Clairvaux  and actively sought to remove royal influence in the French church  Louis confiscated Stephen’s wealth and began harassing him so that he would cease his reforming activities  At the same time  Louis also had in his sights Henri Sanglier  the Archbishop of Sens  who had also joined the reformers  Charging Henri with simony  Louis attempted to remove another threat from within the French church  Bernard of Clairvaux wrote to Honorius asking him to intervene on behalf of both men and support church independence over the claims of royal jurisdiction and interference   Royal pressure was also brought to bear on Hildebert of Lavardin  whom Honorius had transferred from the see of Le Mans to become the Archbishop of Tours in 1125  In 1126  Louis insisted on filling episcopal vacancies in the See of Tours with his own candidates over Hildebert’s objections  Hildebert also complained to Honorius about the constant appeals to Rome whenever he made a ruling   In response to the king’s actions  the French bishops laid an interdict on the diocese of Paris  causing Louis to write to Honorius  who suspended the interdict in 1129  Although this incurred the wrath of Bernard of Clairvaux  who wrote to Honorius expressing his disgust  Honorius pressured Stephen of Senlis to become reconciled with King Louis in 1130  Henri Sanglier  on the other hand  continued in his role of archbishop without further interference from the king  By the end of his pontificate  Honorius had ended the conflict between Louis and his bishops   In 1127  Honorius confirmed the acts of the Synod of Nantes  presided over by Archbishop Hildebert of Lavardin  which eradicated certain local abuses in Brittany  That same year  Honorius helped Conan III  Duke of Brittany  bring one of his rebellious vassals to heel  He also intervened on behalf of the monks of the Lérins Islands who were constantly harassed by Arab pirates  encouraging a crusade to help defend the monks   Honorius was also called to intervene in the affairs of Normandy  as Fulk of Anjou and King Henry I of England battled for domination  Henry objected to the marriage of Fulk’s daughter Sibylla of Anjou to William Clito  the son of the duke of Normandy  on the grounds that they were too closely related by blood  being sixth cousins  They refused to divorce  and Honorius was forced to excommunicate Fulk and his son in law and to impose an interdict upon their territories   3 5  Relations with England and Spain  In England  the ongoing dispute between the Sees of Canterbury and York over primacy continued unabated  On 5 April 1125  Honorius wrote to Thurstan  Archbishop of York  advising him that Honorius planned to settle the issue personally  He sent a legate  Cardinal John of Crema  to deal with the question of primacy  as well as other jurisdictional issues between Canterbury and Wales  and between York  Scotland and Norway  Honorius wrote to the clergy and nobles of England  directing them to treat his legate as if he were Honorius himself   In Honorius’s name  John of Crema convened the Synod of Roxburgh in 1125  In a letter written to King David I of Scotland  the king was asked to send the bishops of Scotland to the Council  which discussed the claims of the Archbishop of York to have jurisdiction over the church in Scotland  Upholding the claims of York  Honorius was unsuccessful in forcing the Scottish bishops to obey Archbishop Thurstan   Next  John convened the Synod of Westminster in September 1125  which was attended by both the archbishops of Canterbury and York  together with twenty bishops and forty abbots  Although the synod issued rulings on the forbidding of simony and of holding multiple sees at the same time  it did not touch on the vexed question of primacy between Canterbury and York  Instead  John summoned the two prelates to travel with him to Rome to discuss the matter in person before Honorius  They arrived in late 1125 and were greeted warmly by Honorius  and they remained in Rome until early 1126  While there  Honorius ruled that the Bishop of St Andrews was to be subject to the Archbishop of York and in the more contentious issue  he attempted to circumvent his way around the problem by declaring that Thurstan was subject to William de Corbeil  not in his role as Archbishop of Canterbury  but as papal legate for England and Scotland  To emphasise this  Honorius decreed that the Archbishop of Canterbury could not ask for any oath of obedience from the Archbishop of York  and in the matter of honorary distinction  it was the Archbishop of Canterbury in his role as Legate that was the most elevated ecclesiastic in the kingdom   Urban of Llandaff also travelled to Rome on numerous occasions to meet with Honorius throughout 1128 and 1129  to plead his case that his diocese should not be subject to the see of Canterbury  Although he obtained numerous privileges for his see and Honorius always spoke encouragingly to him  Honorius avoided having to make a decision that might alienate the powerful archbishops of Canterbury   In Spain  Honorius was deeply suspicious of the ambitions of Diego Gelmírez  the Archbishop of Compostela  Although Pope Callixtus II had made him Papal Legate of a number of Spanish provinces  Honorius informed Diego that he had been made aware of Diego’s ambitions and subtly advised him to keep his ambition in check  Still hoping to be promoted to the office of Legate of Spain  Diego sent envoys to Rome  carrying with them 300 gold Almoravid coins  two hundred and twenty for Honorius and another eighty for the Curia  Honorius repeated that his hands were tied  as he had just appointed a cardinal for that post   Nevertheless  Honorius was not prepared to completely alienate Diego  and when the Archbishop of Braga nominated a successor to the vacant See of Coimbra  Honorius reprimanded the archbishop for usurping the rights of Diego  who should have been the one to nominate a successor  Honorius also demanded that the Archbishop of Braga present himself before Honorius on the second Sunday after Easter in 1129 to answer for his actions  Honorius also ensured that Diego should play a leading role in the Synod of Carrión  February 1130   having his legate approach Diego and ask for his assistance during the synod   Honorius also wished to promote the ongoing struggle against the Moors in Spain  and to that end he bestowed the city of Tarragona  which had been recently captured from the Moors  to Robert d Aguiló  Robert travelled to Rome to receive the gift from Honorius in 1128   3 6  Establishment of the Templars and affairs in the East  In 1119  a new religious order had been established by some French noblemen  Called the Knights Templar  they were to protect Christian pilgrims entering the Holy Land and to defend the conquests of the Crusades  However  by the pontificate of Honorius II  they had not yet received any official sanction from the papacy  To rectify this situation  some members of the order appeared before the Council of Troyes in 1129  where the Council expressed its approval of the order and commissioned Bernard of Clairvaux to draw up the order’s rules  which now included vows of poverty  chastity and obedience  The order and the rules were subsequently approved by Honorius   Honorius  as suzerain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  re confirmed the election of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and established him as the royal parton of the Templars  Honorius tried to manage as best he could the rivalries of the different princes and high ranking ecclesiastics that were destabilising the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem  Long standing arguments over areas of jurisdiction between the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem were a constant source of irritation to Honorius  Honorius supported the claims of William of Malines  the new Archbishop of Tyre who claimed jurisdiction over some of the sees that had traditionally belonged to Bernard of Valence  the Patriarch of Antioch  Bernard refused to give up his claims to the sees  and William travelled to Rome and presented his case before Honorius  The pope sent a legate back to Palestine with instructions that Bernard was to acquiesce and that the various bishops were to submit to William of Malines within forty days  Bernard managed to resist implementing Honorius’s instructions  and soon Honorius was too ill to do anything about it   3 7  Death of Honorius II  After almost a year of suffering a painful illness  Honorius fell seriously ill in early 1130  Cardinal Aymeric and the Frangipani family began planning their next moves  and Honorius was taken to the San Gregorio Magno al Celio monastery  which was located in the territory controlled by the Frangipani  Supporters of the Pierleoni family  already preparing to back Pietro Pierleoni on a rumor that Honorius had died  stormed the monastery of the dying Honorius  hoping to force the election of Pietro  Only the sight of the still living Honorius in full pontifical robes forced them to disperse   Nevertheless  Cardinal Aymeric’s plans had not yet reached fruition when Honorius died on the evening of 13 February 1130  The cardinals supporting the Frangipani immediately closed the monastery gates and refused to allow anyone inside  The next day  and contrary to the usual customs  Honorius was quickly buried without any pomp or ceremony in the monastery  as the hand picked cardinals got around to electing Gregorio Papareschi  who took the name Pope Innocent II  At the same time  the excluded cardinals  most of whom were supporters of the Pierleoni family  elected Pietro Pierleoni  who took the name Anacletus II  throwing the church once again into schism  Honorius eventually transferred from the monastery to the Lateran for reburial once Innocent II had been elected  He was buried in the south transept next to the body of Callixtus II   4  Legacy  The way in which Honorius was elected meant that he became a creature  not only of Cardinal Aymeric  but also of the Frangipani family  Aymeric expanded his powerbase further  with Honorius elevating mostly non Roman candidates to the college of cardinals  while Papal legates were now chosen solely within the papal circle  Honorius favoured the newer monastic orders  such as the Augustinians  a departure from the policies of the older Gregorian popes who favoured traditional orders such as the Benedictines   At the same time  he found himself drawn into the continued chaos of local Roman politics  as the Frangipani enjoyed their influence at the papal court  while the Pierleoni family continually fought against them and against Honorius  Their ceaseless infighting  repressed during the pontificate of Calixtus II  broke out again  and Honorius found he did not have the resources to suppress the Pierleoni  nor the authority to rein in the Frangipani  Honorius was required to engage in a number of petty wars in Rome  which wasted his time and were in the long haul unsuccessful in restoring order in the streets  The continued chaos would be instrumental in the events that saw the resurrection of Republican sentiment in the city and the eventual establishment of the Commune of Rome in the following decade   5  Sources  Levillain  Philippe  The Papacy  An
