Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg  11 November 1599 – 28 March 1655  was a German princess and queen consort of Sweden   She was the daughter of John Sigismund  Elector of Brandenburg  and Anna  Duchess of Prussia  daughter of Albert Frederick  Duke of Prussia   In the year 1620  Maria Eleonora married the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus with her mother s consent  but against the will of her brother George William  Elector of Brandenburg  who had just succeeded her father  She bore her husband a daughter  Christina  in 1626   She was described as the most beautiful queen in Europe  and  as her daughter later said  had  all the virtues and vices  associated with her gender   1  Engagement  In 1616  the 22 year old Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden started looking around for a Protestant bride  He had since 1613 tried to get his mother s permission to marry the noblewoman Ebba Brahe  but this was not allowed  and he had to give up his wishes to marry her  though he continued to be in love with her  He received reports with the most flattering descriptions of the physical and mental qualities of the beautiful 17 year old princess Maria Eleonora  Elector John Sigismund was favorably inclined towards the Swedish king  but he had become very infirm after an apoplexic stroke in the autumn of 1617  His determined Prussian wife showed a strong dislike for this Swedish suitor  because Prussia was a Polish fief and the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa still resented his loss of Sweden to Gustavus Adolphus  father Charles IX   Maria Eleonora had additional suitors in the young William of Orange  Wladislaw Vasa of Poland  Adolph Friedrich of Mecklenburg and even the future Charles I of England  Maria Eleonora s brother George William was flattered by the offer of the British Crown Prince and proposed their younger sister Catherine  1602–1644  as a more suitable wife for the Swedish king  Maria Eleonora  however  seems to have had a preference for Gustavus Adolphus  For him it was a matter of honour to acquire the hand of Maria Eleonora and none other  He had the rooms of his castle in Stockholm redecorated and started making preparations to leave for Berlin to press his suit in person  when a letter arrived from Maria Eleonora s mother to his mother  The Electress demanded in no uncertain terms that the Queen Dowager should prevent her son s journey  as  being prejudicial to Brandenburg s interests in view of the state of war existing between Sweden and Poland   Her husband  she wrote  was  so enfeebled in will by illness that he could be persuaded to agree to anything  even if it tended to the destruction of the country   It was a rebuff that verged on an insult   2  Marriage and children  The Elector John Sigismund  Maria Eleonora s father  died on 23 December 1619  and the prospect of a Swedish marriage seemed gone with him  In the spring of 1620  however  stubborn Gustavus Adolphus arrived in Berlin  The Electress Dowager maintained an attitude of reserve and even refused to grant the Swedish king a personal meeting with Maria Eleonora  All those who were present  however  noticed the princess s interest in the young king  Afterwards  Gustavus Adolphus made a round of other Protestant German courts with the professed intention of inspecting a few matrimonial alternatives  On his return to Berlin  the Electress Dowager seems to have become completely captivated by the charming Swedish king  After plighting his troth to Maria Eleonora  Gustavus Adolphus hurried back to Sweden to make arrangements for the reception of his bride   The new Elector  George William  who resided in Prussia  was appalled when he heard of his mother s independent action  He wrote to Gustavus Adolphus to refuse his consent to the marriage until Sweden and Poland had settled their differences  It was the Electress Dowager  however  who  in accordance with Hohenzollern family custom  had the last word in bestowing her daughter s hand in marriage  She sent Maria Eleonora to territory outside of George William s reach and concluded the marriage negotiations herself   Anna of Prussia provided herself with a selection of objects of value from the exchequer before she joined Maria Eleonora in Brunswick  A detachment of the Swedish fleet took the women over to Kalmar  where Gustavus Adolphus was impatiently awaiting them  The wedding took place in Stockholm on 25 November 1620  A comedy was performed based on the history of Olof Skötkonung  Gustavus Adolphus   in his own words   finally  had a Brandenburg lady in his marriage bed   Anna of Prussia actually stayed with her daughter in Sweden for several years after the marriage   Gustavus Adolphus shared Maria Eleonora s interest in architecture and her love of music  while she was sentimentally devoted to her husband  Often  she lamented that she never had her hero for herself  Foreign ambassadors found her gracious and beautiful and she had good taste  although her character showed some extravagant traits  Maria Eleonora had a definite liking for entertainment and sweetmeats  and she soon succumbed to the current fashionable craze for buffoons and dwarfs  She spoke French  the court language of the age  but never bothered to learn to write German or Swedish correctly   Within six months of their marriage  Gustavus Adolphus left to command the siege of Riga  leaving Maria Eleonora in the early stages of her first pregnancy  She lived exclusively in the company of her German ladies in waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people  countryside and climate  She disliked the bad roads  sombre forests and wooded houses  roofed with turf  She also pined for her husband  A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill  She was tempestuous  excessive  neurotic and jealous  She was often given to harsh language  and she did not spare her husband  even when strangers were present  Her emotional life lacked balance  and everything Maria Eleonora undertook on her own initiative needed careful watching  Soon Gustavus Adolphus  intimates knew that his married life was a source of grief and anxiety   In the autumn of 1623 Maria Eleonora gave birth to a daughter  but the baby died the next year  At that time  the only surviving male heirs were the hated king of Poland and his sons  With Gustavus Adolphus risking his life in battles  an heir to the throne was anxiously awaited  In the autumn Maria Eleonora was pregnant for a third time  In May 1625 she was in good spirits and insisted on accompanying her husband on the royal yacht to review the fleet  There seemed to be no danger  as the warships were moored just opposite the castle  but a sudden storm nearly capsized the yacht  The queen was hurried back to the castle  but when she got there she was heard to exclaim   Jesus  I cannot feel my child   Shortly afterwards the longed for son was stillborn   3  Birth of Christina  With the renewal of the war with Poland  Gustavus Adolphus had to leave his wife again  It is likely that she gave way to hysterical grief  as we know she did in 1627  and it is probably for this reason that the king let his queen join him in Livonia after the Poles had been defeated in January 1626  By April  Maria Eleonora found she was again pregnant  No risks were taken this time and the astrologers predicted the birth of a son and heir  During a lull in the warfare  Gustavus Adolphus hurried back to Stockholm to await the arrival of the baby  The birth was a difficult one  On 7 December  a baby was born with a fleece  which enveloped it from its head to its knees  leaving only its face  arms and lower part of its legs free  Moreover  it had a large nose and was covered with hair  Thus  it was assumed the baby was a boy  and so the King was told  Closer inspection  however  determined that the baby was a girl  Gustavus Adolphus  half sister Catherine informed him that the child was a girl  She  carried the baby in her arms to the king in a condition for him to see and to know and realise for himself what she dared not tell him   Gustavus Adolphus remarked   She is going to be clever  for she has taken us all in   His disappointment did not last long  and he decided that she would be called Christina after his mother  He gave orders for the birth to be announced with all the solemnity usually accorded to the arrival of a male heir  This seems to indicate that Gustavus Adolphus  at the age of 33  had little hope of having other children  Maria Eleonora s state of health seems to be the most likely explanation for this  Her later portraits and actions  however  do not indicate that she was physically fragile   Shortly after the birth  Maria Eleonora was in no condition to be told the truth about the baby s sex  and the king and court waited several days before breaking the news to her  She screamed   Instead of a son  I am given a daughter  dark and ugly  with a great nose and black eyes  Take her from me  I will not have such a monster   She may have suffered from a post natal depression  In her agitated state  the queen tried to injure the child  In Christina s early childhood  she repeatedly met with accidents  Once a beam fell mysteriously upon the cradle  Another time  she  accidentally  fell off the stairs  On another occasion the nursemaid was blamed for dropping the baby onto a stone floor  injuring a shoulder that ever afterwards remained a little crooked   In the year after Christina s birth  Maria Eleonora was described as being in a state of hysteria owing to her husband s absences  In 1632 Gustavus Adolphus described his wife as being  a very sick woman   There was some excuse for her  she had lost three babies and still felt herself an isolated foreigner in a hostile land  even more so after 1627 when her brother joined Sweden s enemies  Meanwhile  her husband s life was constantly in danger when he was on campaign  In 1627 Gustavus Adolphus was both ill and wounded  Two years later he had a narrow escape at Stuhm   Gustavus Adolphus was devoted to his daughter and tried to rear Christina as a boy  At the age of two  she clapped her hands and laughed with joy when the great cannons of Kalmar Castle boomed out the royal salute  Afterwards  Gustavus Adolphus often took his daughter with him to military reviews  Maria Eleonora showed little affection for her daughter and was not allowed any influence in Christina s upbringing  The princess was placed in the care of Gustavus Adolphus  half sister Catherine and the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna   In 1630 Gustavus Adolphus concluded that Habsburg designs for Baltic supremacy threatened Sweden s very existence and also its religious freedom  Before he left to join the Thirty Years War  he discussed a possible regency with members of the government and admitted to them that his wife was  a miserable woman   Even so  Gustavus Adolphus could not bring himself to nominate a regency council in which her name did not appear  To Axel Oxenstierna  he confessed   If anything happens to me  my family will merit your pity       the mother lacking in common sense  the daughter a minor   hopeless  if they rule  and dangerous  if others come to rule over them    4  Issue  5  Widowhood  During the next two years Gustavus Adolphus marched across a devastated Germany  conquering Pomerania and Mecklenburg  In early November 1632 he went to Erfurt to say goodbye to Maria Eleonora  who had been in Germany since the previous winter  In the Battle of Lützen  the 37 year old Gustavus Adolphus was shot in the back  He fell and was dragged for some distance by his horse  He managed to free himself from the stirrup  but while lying on the ground  The Lion of the North  was killed by another shot through his head  By nightfall both armies were exhausted  but Bernard of Saxe Weimar and the Swedes had captured all the Imperial artillery and were in possession of the key position  The king s body was found lying face downwards in the mud  plundered of everything but his shirt   In 1633 Maria Eleonora returned to Sweden with the embalmed body of her husband  In Nyköping  7 year old Queen Christina came in solemn procession to the ship to receive her mother  Later she wrote   I embraced the queen my mother  she drowned me with her tears and practically smothered me in her arms   For more than a year Maria Eleonora condemned the active  spirited little Queen to an appalling mourning seclusion in rooms draped with black and lit by candles day and night  from which every ray of light was excluded  She made her daughter sleep with her in a bed over which her father s heart was hung in a golden casket  Things were made worse by Maria Eleonora s continual weeping  Christina  who was herself somewhat malformed with one shoulder higher than the other  also detested her mother s dwarfs and buffoons  She became seriously ill  an ulcer appeared on her left breast  causing her terrible pain and a high fever until it burst  In the summer of 1634 the funeral procession finally wound its way to Stockholm  Queen Christina later wrote about her mother   She carried out her role of mourning to perfection    Maria Eleonora had plunged into a prolonged crisis of hysteria and indulged in orgies of grief  She found it more difficult than ever to conceal her dislike of Swedish  rocks and mountains  the freezing air  and all the rest of it   During the rest of her life she pathetically preserved the memory of her hero husband  She used to weep for hours and even days on an end  When the regency council tried to separate Christina from her mother  Maria Eleonora wept and protested so bitterly that nothing was done   Maria Eleonora was not included in the regency government during the minority of her daughter  The council of state did not wish to include her because they did not consider her suitable as regent  The king had never actually left any instructions that she should not be included in the case of a minor regency  but they supported their grounds for excluding her by the claim that the late king had said to them that she should never be entrusted with matters of state  though he never left any papers to confirm this  When she was informed that the regency government had been formed in May 1633 and that she had been excluded from it  Maria Eleonora was reportedly offended  She pointed out the fact that her late mother in law  Christina of Holstein Gottorp  had been a part of the regency during the minority of her late spouse in 1611  but upon this  however  the representative of the regency council  Gabriel Gustavsson Oxenstierna  actually lied to her by saying that the information about the late queen dowager Christina was highly exaggerated and that Sweden actually had no tradition to included queen dowagers in minor regencies  This was in fact a lie  the late queen dowager Christina had indeed been regent during the minority of the late king in October–December of 1611  and king Gustav I of Sweden had in 1544 also left an instruction that his queen  Margaret Leijonhufvud  should become regent if he should died during the minority of his heir  Maria Eleonora  however  answered that she accepted the matter  denied any interest from her part to participate in state affairs  declared herself satisfied to entrust politics to others  and explained that she would be pleased to be in control of the custody of her daughter   6  Relationship with Queen Christina  In 1636 Maria Eleonora was taken to Gripsholm castle and officially lost her parental rights to her daughter  because at times she was completely out of her mind  In 1639 a letter written by her and intended for Sweden s archenemy  the King Christian IV of Denmark  was intercepted  After a summons  Maria Eleonora appeared at her daughter s court in a flood of tears in the summer of 1640  Queen Christina  13 years old  reasoned with her mother and dissuaded her from taking up residence at Nyköping near Denmark  Afterwards  Maria Eleonora returned to Gripsholm  To undertake one of her periodic fasts  she retired to the seclusion of her own apartment  accompanied by only one of her ladies in waiting  Anna Sofia von Bülow  Maria Eleonora wrote regularly to her daughter Christina  She and her German court wanted to leave their exile at Gripsholm castle  Christina replied tactfully  knowing that the Council would not permit the queen mother any leave  Eventually her mother asked to leave Sweden altogether  Christina invited her to Stockholm  attempting to persuade her to stay in the country  At night the two ladies let themselves down from a window and were rowed in a boat to the other side of the nearby lake  where a carriage was waiting for them  They drove to Nyköping  where they boarded a Danish ship  King Christian IV had intended the ship to take her home to Brandenburg  but she convinced the captain to bring her to Denmark instead  She was well received by the Danish king  but that did not make the demanding Maria Eleonora like Denmark any better  She wanted to go home to Brandenburg  The electoral prince there demanded financial compensation from Sweden  where on the contrary the Council expected to withdraw her appanage as well as her properties  Finally the teenage Christina succeeded in negotiating a certain alimony for her mother  adding to this from her own purse   In Denmark  Maria Eleonora became the guest of King Christian IV  The Elector George William refused to receive his sister in Brandenburg  so Maria Eleonora had to wait until his death in December that year before her nephew gave her permission to visit Brandenburg  Still  the new Elector insisted that Sweden should provide for his aunt s upkeep  She received a small pension of 30 000 écus a year  After awhile Maria Eleonora surprisingly started to long for Sweden  and in 1648 she returned  Queen Christina went to meet her mother s ship  It was delayed by a storm and the young queen slept in the open for two nights and contracted a fever  which kept her in bed for some days  In October 1650 Maria Eleonora proudly attended her daughter s postponed coronation ceremony  Christina then bought the newly erected castle Makalös   Unequalled   for her  close to the royal castle in Stockholm  It would have been enormously expensive  but Christina never paid  Instead she handed it back in 1652   In June 1654  Christina shocked everyone when she decided to abdicate in favour of her cousin Charles Gustav  Maria Eleonora had grave doubts about her daughter s abdication and its possible effect upon her own finances  Christina and Charles Gustav visited her at Nyköping in April 1654 and promised the Queen Dowager that she would be provided for  Christina abdicated June 5  1654  Maria Eleonora died in March  1655  At that time  ex Queen Christina was living in Brussels  she converted to Catholicism in December  1655   7  Ancestry  Ancestors of Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg  8  External links  9  References
