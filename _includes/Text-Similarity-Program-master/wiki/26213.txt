In geometry  the rhombicuboctahedron  or small rhombicuboctahedron  is an Archimedean solid with eight triangular and eighteen square faces  There are 24 identical vertices  with one triangle and three squares meeting at each   Note that six of the squares only share vertices with the triangles while the other twelve share an edge   The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry  like the cube and octahedron  Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron  although its faces are not really true trapezoids   The name rhombicuboctahedron refers to the fact that twelve of the square faces lie in the same planes as the twelve faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which is dual to the cuboctahedron  Great rhombicuboctahedron is an alternative name for a truncated cuboctahedron  whose faces are parallel to those of the  small  rhombicuboctahedron   It can also be called an expanded cube or cantellated cube or a cantellated octahedron from truncation operations of the uniform polyhedron   1  Geometric relations  There are distortions of the rhombicuboctahedron that  while some of the faces are not regular polygons  are still vertex uniform  Some of these can be made by taking a cube or octahedron and cutting off the edges  then trimming the corners  so the resulting polyhedron has six square and twelve rectangular faces  These have octahedral symmetry and form a continuous series between the cube and the octahedron  analogous to the distortions of the rhombicosidodecahedron or the tetrahedral distortions of the cuboctahedron  However  the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set of distortions with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces  which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather Th symmetry  so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections   The lines along which a Rubik s Cube can be turned are  projected onto a sphere  similar  topologically identical  to a rhombicuboctahedron s edges  In fact  variants using the Rubik s Cube mechanism have been produced which closely resemble the rhombicuboctahedron   The rhombicuboctahedron is used in three uniform space filling tessellations  the cantellated cubic honeycomb  the runcitruncated cubic honeycomb  and the runcinated alternated cubic honeycomb   1 1  Dissection  The rhombicuboctahedron dissected into two square cupolae and a central octagonal prism  A rotation of one cupola creates the pseudoųrhombiųcuboctaųhedron  Both of these polyhedra have the same vertex figure  3 4 4 4   There are three pairs of parallel planes that each intersect the rhombicuboctahedron in a regular octagon  The rhombicuboctahedron may be divided along any of these to obtain an octagonal prism with regular faces and two additional polyhedra called square cupolae  which count among the Johnson solids  it is thus an elongated square orthobicupola  These pieces can be reassembled to give a new solid called the elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudorhombicuboctahedron  with the symmetry of a square antiprism  In this the vertices are all locally the same as those of a rhombicuboctahedron  with one triangle and three squares meeting at each  but are not all identical with respect to the entire polyhedron  since some are closer to the symmetry axis than others   1 2  Orthogonal projections  The rhombicuboctahedron has six special orthogonal projections  centered  on a vertex  on two types of edges  and three types of faces  triangles  and two squares  The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes   2  Spherical tiling  The rhombicuboctahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling  and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection  This projection is conformal  preserving angles but not areas or lengths  Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane   3  Pyritohedral symmetry  A half symmetry form of the rhombicuboctahedron    exists with pyritohedral symmetry   4 3+    3*2  as Coxeter diagram   Schläfli symbol s2 3 4   and can be called a cantic snub octahedron  This form can be visualized by alternatingly coloring the edges of the 6 squares  These squares can then be distorted into rectangles  while the 8 triangles remain equilateral  The 12 diagonal square faces will become isosceles trapezoids  In the limit  the rectangles can be reduced to edges  and the trapezoids become triangles  and a icosahedron is formed  by a snub octahedron construction    s 3 4    4  Algebraic properties  4 1  Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a rhombicuboctahedron centred at the origin  with edge length 2 units  are all permutations of  If the original rhombicuboctahedron has unit edge length  its dual strombic icositetrahedron has edge lengths  4 2  Area and volume  The area A and the volume V of the rhombicuboctahedron of edge length a are   4 3  Close packing density  The optimal packing fraction of rhombicuboctahedra is given by  It was noticed that this optimal value is obtained in a Bravais lattice by   Since the rhombicuboctahedron is contained in a rhombic dodecahedron whose inscribed sphere is identical to its own inscribed sphere  the value of the optimal packing fraction is a corollary of the Kepler conjecture  it can be achieved by putting a rhombicuboctahedron in each cell of the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb  and it cannot be surpassed  since otherwise the optimal packing density of spheres could be surpassed by putting a sphere in each rhombicuboctahedron of the hypothetical packing which surpasses it   5  In the arts  The large polyhedron in the 1495 portrait of Luca Pacioli  traditionally though controversially attributed to Jacopo de  Barbari  is a glass rhombicuboctahedron half filled with water  The first printed version of the rhombicuboctahedron was by Leonardo da Vinci and appeared in his 1509 Divina Proportione   A spherical 180×360° panorama can be projected onto any polyhedron  but the rhombicuboctahedron provides a good enough approximation of a sphere while being easy to build  This type of projection  called Philosphere  is possible from some panorama assembly software  It consists of two images that are printed separately and cut with scissors while leaving some flaps for assembly with glue   6  Games and toys  The Freescape games Driller and Dark Side both had a game map in the form of a rhombicuboctahedron   A level in the videogame Super Mario Galaxy has a planet in the shape of a rhombicuboctahedron   Sonic the Hedgehog 3 s Icecap Zone features pillars topped with rhombicuboctahedra   During the Rubik s Cube craze of the 1980s  one combinatorial puzzle sold had the form of a rhombicuboctahedron  the mechanism was of course that of a Rubik s Cube    The Rubik s Snake toy was usually sold in the shape of a stretched rhombicuboctahedron  12 of the squares being replaced with 1 √2 rectangles    7  Related polyhedra  The rhombicuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron   This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of cantellated polyhedra with vertex figure  3 4 n 4   and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane  These vertex transitive figures have  *n32  reflectional symmetry   7 1  Vertex arrangement  It shares its vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra  the stellated truncated hexahedron  the small rhombihexahedron  having the triangular faces and six square faces in common   and the small cubicuboctahedron  having twelve square faces in common    8  Rhombicuboctahedral graph  In the mathematical field of graph theory  a rhombicuboctahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the rhombicuboctahedron  one of the Archimedean solids  It has 24 vertices and 48 edges  and is a quartic graph Archimedean graph   9  See also  Compound of five rhombicuboctahedra  Cube
