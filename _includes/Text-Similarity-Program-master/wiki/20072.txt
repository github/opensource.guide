A microassembler is a computer program that helps prepare a microprogram  called firmware  to control the low level operation of a computer in much the same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor  The difference is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer and works intimately with the computer hardware  On a microprogrammed computer the microprogram implements the operations of the instruction set in which any normal program  including both application programs and operating systems  is written  The use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer to fix certain mistakes  including working around hardware design errors  without modifying the hardware  Another means of employing microassembler generated microprograms is in allowing the same hardware to run different instruction sets  After it is assembled  the microprogram is then loaded to a control store to become part of the logic of a CPU s control unit   Some microassemblers are more generalized and are not targeted at a single computer architecture  For example  through the use of macro assembler like capabilities  Digital Equipment Corporation used their MICRO2 microassembler for a very wide range of computer architectures and implementations   If a given computer implementation supports a writeable control store  the microassembler is usually provided to customers as a means of writing customized microcode   In the process of microcode assembly it is helpful to verify the microprogram with emulation tools before distribution  Nowadays  microcoding has experienced a revival  since it is possible to correct and optimize the firmware of processing units already manufactured or sold  in order to adapt to specific operating systems or to fix hardware bugs  However  a commonly usable microassembler for today s CPUs is not available to manipulate the microcode  Unfortunately  knowledge of a processor s microcode is usually considered proprietary information so it is difficult to obtain information about how to modify it   1  External links
