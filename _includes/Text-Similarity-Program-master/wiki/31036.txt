A triode is an electronic amplifying vacuum tube  or valve in British English  consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope  a heated filament or cathode  a grid  and a plate  anode   Invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest by adding a grid to the Fleming valve  the triode was the first electronic amplification device and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the tetrode and pentode  Its invention founded the electronics age  making possible amplified radio technology and long distance telephony  Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s  when transistors replaced them  Today  their main remaining use is in high power RF amplifiers in radio transmitters and industrial RF heating devices  The word is derived from the Greek τρίοδος  tríodos  from tri   three  and hodós  road  way   originally meaning the place where three roads meet   1  History  The first vacuum tube  the diode  which had two electrodes  a filament and a plate  anode   was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a radio receiver detector  The first three element tube  a mercury vapor filled tube with a control grid  was patented on March 4  1906  by the Austrian Robert von Lieben   Independently  beginning in 1906  American engineer Lee De Forest invented a number of three element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode  which he called Audions  The Audion is considered the first triode  The one which became the design of the triode  in which the grid was located between the filament and plate  was patented January 29  1907  The Audion was incompletely evacuated and contained some gas at low pressure  thought to be necessary by De Forest  which caused erratic operation and shortened the life of the filament  Invented as a radio receiver detector  the Audion did not see much use until its ability to amplify was recognized around 1912 by several researchers  who used it to build the first successful amplifying radio receivers and electronic oscillators  The many uses for amplification motivated its rapid development  By 1913 improved versions with higher vacuum were developed by Harold Arnold at American Telephone and Telegraph Company which had purchased the rights to the Audion from De Forest  and Irving Langmuir at General Electric  who named his tube the  Pliotron   These were the first vacuum tube triodes  The name triode appeared later  when it became necessary to distinguish it from other kinds of vacuum tubes with more or fewer elements  e g  diodes  tetrodes  pentodes  etc    There were lengthy lawsuits between De Forest and von Lieben  and De Forest and the Marconi Company  representing John Ambrose Fleming who invented the diode   The discovery of the triode s amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology  creating the new field of electronics  the technology of active  amplifying  electrical devices  The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication  Triode  continuous wave  radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient  damped wave  spark gap transmitters  allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation  AM   Amplifying triode radio receivers  which had the power to drive loudspeakers  replaced weak crystal radios  which had to be listened to with earphones  allowing families to listen together  This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium  with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920  Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible  Vacuum tube triode repeaters  invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights  allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles  The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later  on January 25  1915  Other inventions made possible by the triode were television  public address systems  electric phonographs  and talking motion pictures   The triode served as the technological base from which later vacuum tubes developed  such as the tetrode  Walter Schottky  1916  and pentode  Bernardus Tellegen  1926   which remedied some of the shortcomings of the triode detailed below   The triode was very widely used in consumer electronics such as radios  televisions  and audio systems until it was replaced in the 1960s by the transistor  invented in 1947  which brought the  vacuum tube  era started by the triode to a close  Today triodes are mostly used in high power applications for which solid state semiconductor devices are unsuitable  such as radio transmitters and industrial heating equipment   2  Construction  All triodes have a hot cathode electrode heated by a filament  which releases electrons  and a flat metal plate electrode to which the electrons are attracted  with a grid consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current  These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum  about 10−9 atm  Since the filament eventually burns out  the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit  the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket  The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10 000 hours for power tubes   2 1  Low power triodes  Low power triodes have a concentric construction  see drawing right   with the grid and plate as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode  The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center  Inside it is a filament called the  heater  consisting of a narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire  which heats the cathode red hot  800   1000 °C   This type is called an  indirectly heated cathode  The cathode is coated with a mixture of alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons  The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode  The plate is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid  It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat radiating fins  The electrons travel in a radial direction  from the cathode through the grid wires to the plate  The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base  where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins  A  getter   a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass  helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time   2 2  High power triodes  High power triodes generally use a filament which serves as the cathode  a directly heated cathode  because the emission coating on indirectly heated cathodes is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes  A thoriated tungsten filament is most often used  in which thorium in the tungsten forms a monolayer on the surface which increases electron emission  These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes  The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass  and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced  Tubes with plate power dissipation over about 350 W must be actively cooled  The plate electrode  made of heavy copper  projects through the wall of the tube and is attached to a large external finned metal heat sink which is cooled by forced air or water   2 3  Lighthouse tubes  A type of low power triode for use at high  UHF  frequencies  the  lighthouse  tube has a planar construction to reduce interelectrode capacitance and lead inductance  which gives it the appearance of a  lighthouse   The disk shaped cathode  grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube   a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers  The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube s pins  but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube  the grid to a metal ring halfway up  and the plate to a metal button at the top  These are one example of  disk seal  design  Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections  including heater and D C  cathode   As well  high frequency performance is limited by transit time  the time required for electrons to travel from cathode to anode  Transit time effects are complicated  but one simple effect is input conductance  also known as grid loading  At extreme high frequencies  electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode  This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low frequency  open circuit  characteristic   Transit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube  Tubes such as the 416B  a Lighthouse design  and the 7768  an all ceramic miniaturised design  are specified for operation to 4 GHz  They feature greatly reduced grid cathode spacings in the order of 0 1 mm   These greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs  The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225  compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design   Anode grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs  The 6AV6 anode grid capacitance is 2 picofarads  pF   the 7768 has a value of 1 7 pF  The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes increases capacitances  but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower frequency tubes   3  Operation  In the triode  electrons are released into the tube from the metal cathode by heating it  a process called thermionic emission  The cathode is heated red hot by a separate current flowing through a thin metal filament  In a few triodes  the filament itself is the cathode  while in most the filament heats a separate cathode electrode  Virtually all the air is removed from the tube  so the electrons can move freely  The negative electrons are attracted to the positively charged plate  anode   and flow through the spaces between the grid wires to it  creating a current through the tube from cathode to plate   The magnitude of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied between the cathode and the grid  The grid acts like a gate for the electrons  A more negative voltage on the grid will repel some of the electrons  so fewer get through to the plate  reducing the plate current  A positive voltage on the grid will attract more electrons from the cathode  so more reach the plate  increasing the plate current  Therefore  a low power varying  AC  signal applied to the grid can control a much more powerful plate current  resulting in amplification  Variation in the grid voltage will cause identical proportional variations in the plate current  By placing a suitable load resistance in the plate circuit  the varying current will cause a varying voltage across the resistance which can be much larger than the input voltage variations  resulting in voltage gain   The triode is a normally  on  device  and current flows to the plate with zero voltage on the grid  The plate current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative with respect to the cathode  Usually a constant DC voltage   bias   is applied to the grid to set the DC current through the tube  and the varying signal voltage is superimposed on it  A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid  usually around 3 5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6  but as much as –130 volts in early audio power devices such as the  45  will prevent any electrons from getting through to the plate  turning off the plate current  This is called the  cutoff voltage   Since below cutoff the plate current ceases to respond to the grid voltage  the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful  linear  amplification   The triode is very similar in operation to the n channel JFET  it is normally on  and progressively switched off as the grid gate is pulled increasingly negative of the source cathode   4  Applications  Although S G  Brown s Type G Telephone Relay  using a magnetic  earphone  mechanism driving a carbon microphone element  was able to give power amplification and had been in use as early as 1914  it was a purely mechanical device with limited frequency range and fidelity  It was suited only to a limited range of audio frequencies   essentially voice frequencies   The triode was the first non mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies  and made radio practical  Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators  Many types are used only at low to moderate frequency and power levels  Large water cooled triodes may be used as the final amplifier in radio transmitters  with ratings of thousands of watts  Specialized types of triode   lighthouse  tubes  with low capacitance between elements  provide useful gain at microwave frequencies   Vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass marketed consumer electronics  having been overtaken by less expensive transistor based solid state devices  Triodes continue to be used in certain performance sensitive areas such as high end and professional audio applications  as well as in microphone preamplifiers  electric guitar amplifiers  and high power RF amplifiers and transmitters   5  Characteristics  In triode datasheets  characteristics linking the anode current Ia  to anode voltage  Va  and grid voltage  Vg  are usually given  From here  a circuit designer can choose the operating point of the particular triode   In the example characteristic shown on the image  if an anode voltage Va of 200 V and a grid voltage bias of  1 volt are selected  a plate  anode  current of 2 25 mA will be present  using the yellow curve on the graph   Changing the grid voltage will change the plate current  by suitable choice of a plate load resistor  amplification is obtained   In the class A triode amplifier  an anode resistor would be connected between the anode and the positive voltage source  For example  with Ra 10000 Ohms  the voltage drop on it would be  VRa IaȕRa 22 5 V if an anode current of Ia 2 25 mA is chosen   If the input voltage amplitude  at the grid  changes from  1 5 V to  0 5 V  difference of 1 V   the anode current will change from 1 2 to 3 3 mA  see image   This will change the resistor voltage drop from 12 to 33 V  a difference of 21 V    Since the grid voltage changes from  1 5 V to  0 5 V  and the anode resistor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V  an amplification of the signal resulted  The amplification factor is 21   output voltage amplitude divided by input voltage amplitude   6
