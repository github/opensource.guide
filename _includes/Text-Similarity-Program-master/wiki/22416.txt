Otto Eduard Leopold  Prince of Bismarck  Duke of Lauenburg  1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898   known as Otto von Bismarck  was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890  In the 1860s he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states  excluding Austria  into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership  With that accomplished by 1871 he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to preserve German hegemony in a Europe which  despite many disputes and war scares  remained at peace  For historian Eric Hobsbawm  it was Bismarck  who  remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871   and  devoted himself exclusively  and successfully  to maintaining peace between the powers    In 1862 King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia  a post he would hold until 1890  except for a short break in 1873   He provoked three short  decisive wars against Denmark  Austria and France  aligning the smaller German states behind Prussia in defeating his arch enemy France  In 1871 he formed the German Empire with himself as Chancellor  while retaining control of Prussia  His diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the  Iron Chancellor   German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation to his foreign policy  He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion  Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences  negotiations and alliances  he used his unrivaled diplomatic skills to maintain Germany s position and used the balance of power to keep Europe at peace in the 1870s and 1880s   He was the master of complex politics at home  He created the first welfare state in the modern world  with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies  In the 1870s he allied himself with the Liberals  who were low tariff and anti Catholic  and fought the Catholic Church in a culture war  He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Center party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats  Bismarck then reversed himself  ended the culture war  broke with the Liberals  imposed tariffs  and formed a political alliance with the Center party to fight the Socialists  A devout Lutheran  he was loyal to his king  who in turn gave Bismarck his full support  against the advice of his wife and his heir  While Germany s parliament was elected by universal male suffrage  it did not have real control of the government  Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong  well trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that comprised the landed nobility of the east  Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs under the elderly Wilhelm I until he was removed by young Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890   Bismarck  an aristocratic Junker himself  had an extremely aggressive and domineering personality  He displayed a violent temper and kept his power by threatening to resign time and again  He possessed not only a long term national and international vision  but also the short term ability to juggle many complex developments simultaneously  As the leader of what historians call  revolutionary conservatism   Bismarck became a hero to German nationalists  they built hundreds of monuments glorifying the iconic symbol of powerful conservative leadership  Historians generally praise him as a statesman of moderation and balance who kept the peace in Europe  and was primarily responsible for the unification of Germany and building its world renowned bureaucracy and army   1  Early years  Bismarck was born in Schönhausen  a wealthy family estate situated west of Berlin in the Prussian province of Saxony  His father  Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck  1771–1845   was a Junker estate owner and a former Prussian military officer  his mother  Wilhelmine Luise Mencken  1789–1839   was the well educated daughter of a senior government official in Berlin  The world saw Bismarck as a typical Prussian Junker—an image which he encouraged by wearing military uniforms  Bismarck was well educated and cosmopolitan  with a gift for conversation  He was fluent in English  French  Italian  Polish and Russian   Bismarck was educated at Johann Ernst Plamann s elementary school  and the Friedrich Wilhelm and Graues Kloster secondary schools  From 1832 to 1833 he studied law at the University of Göttingen  where he was a member of the Corps Hannovera  and then enrolled at the University of Berlin  1833–35   In 1838  while stationed as an army reservist in Greifswald  he studied agriculture at the University of Greifswald  At Göttingen  Bismarck became friends with the American student John Lothrop Motley  Motley  who later became an eminent historian and diplomat while remaining close to Bismarck  wrote a novel in 1839  Morton s Hope  or the Memoirs of a Provincial  about life in a German university  In it he described Bismarck as a reckless and dashing eccentric  but also as an extremely gifted and charming young man   Although Bismarck hoped to become a diplomat  he started his practical training as a lawyer in Aachen and Potsdam  and soon resigned  having first placed his career in jeopardy by taking unauthorized leave to pursue two English girls  first Laura Russell  niece of the Duke of Cleveland  and then Isabella Loraine Smith  daughter of a wealthy clergyman  He also served in the army for a year and became an officer in the Landwehr  reserve   before returning to run the family estates at Schönhausen on his mother s death in his mid twenties   Around age 30 Bismarck had an intense friendship with Marie von Thadden  newly married to one of his friends  Under her influence  Bismarck became a Pietist Lutheran  and later recorded that at Marie s deathbed  from typhoid  he prayed for the first time since his childhood  Bismarck married Marie s cousin  the noblewoman Johanna von Puttkamer  1824–94  at Alt Kolziglow  modern Kołczygłowy  on 28 July 1847  Their long and happy marriage produced three children  Herbert  b  1849   Wilhelm  b  1852  and Marie  b  1847   Johanna was a shy  retiring and deeply religious woman—although famed for her sharp tongue in later life—and in his public life Bismarck was sometimes accompanied by his sister Malwine  Malle  von Arnim  Bismarck soon adopted his wife s pietism  and he remained a devout Pietist Lutheran for the rest of his life   2  Early political career  In 1847 Bismarck  aged 32  was chosen as a representative to the newly created Prussian legislature  the   There  he gained a reputation as a royalist and reactionary politician with a gift for stinging rhetoric  he openly advocated the idea that the monarch had a divine right to rule  His selection was arranged by the Gerlach brothers  fellow Pietist Lutherans whose ultra conservative faction was known as the  Kreuzzeitung  after their newspaper  the Neue Preussische Zeitung  which was so nicknamed because it featured an Iron Cross on its cover   In March 1848  Prussia faced a revolution  one of the revolutions of 1848 across Europe   which completely overwhelmed King Frederick William IV  The monarch  though initially inclined to use armed forces to suppress the rebellion  ultimately declined to leave Berlin for the safety of military headquarters at Potsdam  Bismarck later recorded that there had been a  rattling of sabres in their scabbards  from Prussian officers when they learned that the King would not suppress the revolution by force   He offered numerous concessions to the liberals  he wore the black red and gold revolutionary colours  as seen on the flag of today s Germany   promised to promulgate a constitution  agreed that Prussia and other German states should merge into a single nation state  and appointed a liberal  Ludolf Camphausen  as Minister President   Bismarck had at first tried to rouse the peasants of his estate into an army to march on Berlin in the King s name  He travelled to Berlin in disguise to offer his services  but was instead told to make himself useful by arranging food supplies for the Army from his estates in case they were needed  The King s brother  Prince Wilhelm had fled to England  and Bismarck intrigued with Wilhelm s wife Augusta to place their teenage son Frederick William on the Prussian throne in Frederick William IV s place  Augusta would have none of it  and detested Bismarck thereafter  despite the fact that he later helped restore a working relationship between the King and his brother  Bismarck was not yet a member of the Landtag—the lower house of the new Prussian legislature  The liberal movement perished by the end of 1848 amid internal fighting  Meanwhile  the conservatives regrouped  formed an inner group of advisers—including the Gerlach brothers—known as the  Camarilla —around the King  and retook control of Berlin  Although a constitution was granted  its provisions fell far short of the demands of the revolutionaries   In 1849  Bismarck was elected to the Landtag  At this stage in his career  he opposed the unification of Germany  arguing that Prussia would lose its independence in the process  He accepted his appointment as one of Prussia s representatives at the Erfurt Parliament  an assembly of German states that met to discuss plans for union  but he only did so to oppose that body s proposals more effectively  The parliament failed to bring about unification  for it lacked the support of the two most important German states  Prussia and Austria  In September 1850  after a dispute over Hesse   the Hesse Crisis of 1850  Prussia was humiliated and forced to back down by Austria  supported by Russia  in the so called Punctation of Olmütz  a plan for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership  proposed by Prussia s Minister President Radowitz  was also abandoned   In 1851  Frederick William IV appointed Bismarck as Prussia s envoy to the Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt  Bismarck gave up his elected seat in the Landtag  but was appointed to the Prussian House of Lords a few years later  In Frankfurt he engaged in a battle of wills with the Austrian representative Count Friedrich von Thun und Hohenstein  insisting on being treated as an equal by petty tactics such as insisting on doing the same when Thun claimed the privileges of smoking and removing his jacket in meetings  This episode was the background for an altercation in the Frankfurt chamber with Georg von Vincke that led to a duel between Bismarck and Vincke and Carl von Bodelschwingh as impartial party  which ended without injury   Bismarck s eight years in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his political opinions  detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin  No longer under the influence of his ultraconservative Prussian friends  Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic  He became convinced that to countervail Austria s newly restored influence  Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states  As a result  he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation  He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had to take the lead in the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed  He also believed that the middle class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society   Bismarck also worked to maintain the friendship of Russia and a working relationship with Napoleon III s France—the latter being anathema to his conservative friends the Gerlachs  but necessary both to threaten Austria and to prevent France allying herself to Russia  In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach  Bismarck wrote that it was foolish to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds  This observation was ironic as after 1871  France indeed became Germany s permanent enemy  and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s   Bismarck was also horrified by Prussia s isolation during the Crimean War of the mid 1850s  in which Austria sided with Britain and France against Russia  Prussia was almost not invited to the peace talks in Paris  In the Eastern crisis of the 1870s  fear of a repetition of this turn of events would later be a factor in Bismarck s signing the Dual Alliance with Austria Hungary in 1879  However  in the 1850s Bismarck correctly foresaw that by failing to support Russia  after Russian help in crushing the Hungarian Revolt in 1849  and at Olmütz in 1850  the Austrian leader Schwarzenberg had said   Austria would astonish the world by the depth of her ingratitude    Austria could no longer count on her support in Italy and Germany  and had thus exposed herself to attack by France and Prussia   3  Ambassador to Russia and France  In October 1857  Frederick William IV suffered a paralysing stroke  His brother Wilhelm took over the Prussian government as Regent  Wilhelm was initially seen as a moderate ruler  whose friendship with liberal Britain was symbolised by the recent marriage of his son Frederick William to Queen Victoria s eldest daughter  As part of Wilhelm s  New Course  he brought in new ministers  moderate conservatives known as the  Wochenblatt  party after their newspaper  Soon the Regent replaced Bismarck as envoy in Frankfurt and made him Prussia s ambassador to the Russian Empire  In theory  this was a promotion as Russia was one of Prussia s two most powerful neighbors  But Bismarck was sidelined from events in Germany  watching impotently as France drove Austria out of Lombardy during the Italian War of 1859  Bismarck proposed that Prussia should exploit Austria s weakness to move her frontiers  as far south as Lake Constance  on the Swiss border  instead Prussia mobilised troops in the Rhineland to deter further French advances into Venetia   As a further snub  the Regent  who scorned Bismarck as a  Landwehrleutnant   reserve lieutenant   had declined to promote him to the rank of major general  normal for the ambassador to St Petersburg  and important as Prussia and Russia were close military allies  whose heads of state often communicated through military contacts rather than diplomatic channels   Bismarck stayed in St Petersburg for four years  during which he almost lost his leg to botched medical treatment and once again met his future adversary  the Russian Prince Gorchakov  who had been the Russian representative in Frankfurt in the early 1850s  The Regent also appointed Helmuth von Moltke as the new Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army  and Albrecht von Roon as Minister of War with the job of reorganizing the army  Over the next 12 years these two and Bismarck transformed Prussia  Bismarck later referred to this period as  the most significant of my life    Despite his lengthy stay abroad  Bismarck was not entirely detached from German domestic affairs  He remained well informed due to his friendship with Roon  and they formed a lasting political alliance  In May 1862  he was sent to Paris  to serve as ambassador to France  He also visited England that summer  These visits enabled him to meet and take the measure of several adversaries—Napoleon III in France  and in Britain  Prime Minister Palmerston  Foreign Secretary Earl Russell  and Conservative politician Benjamin Disraeli  Disraeli  who would become Prime Minister in the 1870s  later claimed to have said of Bismarck   Be careful of that man – he means every word he says    4  Minister President of Prussia  The regent became King Wilhelm I upon his brother s death in 1861  The new monarch often came into conflict with the increasingly liberal Prussian Diet  A crisis arose in 1862  when the Diet refused to authorize funding for a proposed re organization of the army  The King s ministers could not convince legislators to pass the budget  and the King was unwilling to make concessions  Wilhelm threatened to abdicate in favour of Frederick William  who opposed it  and believed that Bismarck was the only politician capable of handling the crisis  However  Wilhelm was ambivalent about appointing a person who demanded unfettered control over foreign affairs  When  in September 1862  the Abgeordnetenhaus  House of Deputies  overwhelmingly rejected the proposed budget  Wilhelm was persuaded to recall Bismarck to Prussia on the advice of Roon  On 23 September 1862  Wilhelm appointed Bismarck Minister President and Foreign Minister   Bismarck  Roon and Moltke took charge at a time when relations among the Great Powers—Great Britain  France  Austria and Russia—had been shattered by the Crimean War and the Italian War  In the midst of this disarray  the European balance of power was restructured with the creation of the German Empire as the dominant power in Europe  This was achieved by Bismarck s diplomacy  Roon s reorganization of the army  and Moltke s military strategy   Despite the initial distrust of the King and Crown Prince  and the loathing of Queen Augusta  Bismarck soon acquired a powerful hold over the King by force of personality and powers of persuasion  Bismarck was intent on maintaining royal supremacy by ending the budget deadlock in the King s favour  even if he had to use extralegal means to do so  Under the Constitution  the budget could only be passed after the king and legislature agreed on its terms  Bismarck contended that since the Constitution did not provide for cases in which legislators failed to approve a budget  there was a  hole  in the Constitution  and he could merely apply the previous year s budget to keep the government running  Thus  on the basis of the 1861 budget  tax collection continued for four years   Bismarck s conflict with the legislators intensified in the coming years  Following the Alvensleben Convention of 1863  the House of Deputies resolved that it could no longer come to terms with Bismarck  in response  the King dissolved the Diet  accusing it of trying to obtain unconstitutional control over the ministry  which  under the Constitution  was responsible solely to the king   Bismarck then issued an edict restricting the freedom of the press  this policy even gained the public opposition of the Crown Prince  Despite attempts to silence critics  Bismarck remained a largely unpopular politician  His supporters fared poorly in the elections of October 1863  in which a liberal coalition  whose primary member was the Progress Party  won over two thirds of the seats  The House made repeated calls for Bismarck to be dismissed  but the King supported him as he feared that if he did dismiss the Minister President  he would likely be succeeded by a liberal   5  Unification of Germany  5 1  Blood and Iron speech  German unification had been a major objective of the revolutions of 1848  when representatives of the German states met in Frankfurt and drafted a constitution creating a federal union with a national parliament to be elected by universal male suffrage  In April 1849  the Frankfurt Parliament offered the title of Emperor to King Frederick William IV  Fearing the opposition of the other German princes and the military intervention of Austria and Russia  the King refused this popular mandate  Thus  the Frankfurt Parliament ended in failure for the German liberals  On 30 September 1862  Bismarck made a speech to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies  in which he expounded on the use of  iron and blood  to achieve Prussia s goals   5 2  Defeat of Denmark  Germany  prior to the 1860s  consisted of a multitude of principalities loosely bound together as members of the German Confederation  Bismarck used both diplomacy and the Prussian military to achieve unification  excluding Austria from a unified Germany  Not only did this make Prussia the most powerful and dominant component of the new Germany  but also ensured that it remained authoritarian  rather than a liberal parliamentary regime   Bismarck faced a diplomatic crisis when Frederick VII of Denmark died in November 1863  Succession to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were disputed  they were claimed by Christian IX  Frederick VII s heir as King  and by Frederick von Augustenburg  a Danish duke  Prussian public opinion strongly favoured Augustenburg s claim  as Holstein and southern Schleswig were and still are mostly German speaking  Bismarck took an unpopular step by insisting that the territories legally belonged to the Danish monarch under the London Protocol signed a decade earlier  Nonetheless  Bismarck denounced Christian s decision to completely annex Schleswig to Denmark  With support from Austria  he issued an ultimatum for Christian IX to return Schleswig to its former status  When Denmark refused  Austria and Prussia invaded  commencing the Second Schleswig War and Denmark was forced to cede both duchies   At first this seemed like a victory for Frederick of Augustenburg  but Bismarck soon removed him from power by making a series of unworkable demands  namely that Prussia should have control over the army and navy of the Duchies  Originally  it was proposed that the Diet of the German Confederation  in which all the states of Germany were represented  should determine the fate of the duchies  but before this scheme could be effected  Bismarck induced Austria to agree to the Gastein Convention  Under this agreement signed 20 August 1865  Prussia received Schleswig  while Austria received Holstein  In that year he was given the title of Graf  Count  von Bismarck Schönhausen   5 3  Defeat of Austria  In 1866  Austria reneged on the agreement and demanded that the Diet determine the Schleswig–Holstein issue  Bismarck used this as an excuse to start a war with Austria by accusing them of violating the Gastein Convention  Bismarck sent Prussian troops to occupy Holstein  Provoked  Austria called for the aid of other German states  who quickly became involved in the Austro Prussian War  Thanks to Roon s reorganising  the Prussian army was nearly equal in numbers to the Austrian army  With the strategic genius of Moltke  the Prussian army fought battles it was able to win  Bismarck had also made a secret alliance with Italy  who desired Austrian controlled Venetia  Italy s entry into the war forced the Austrians to divide their forces   Meanwhile  as the war began  a German radical named Ferdinand Cohen Blind attempted to assassinate Bismarck in Berlin  shooting him five times at close range  Bismarck had only minor injuries  Cohen Blind committed suicide while in custody   The war lasted seven weeks—Germans called it a  Blitzkrieg    lightning war —a term also used in 1939   Austria had a seemingly powerful army  it was allied with most of the north German and all of the south German states  Nevertheless Prussia won the decisive Battle of Königgrätz  The King and his generals wanted to push onward  conquer Bohemia and march to Vienna  but Bismarck  worried that Prussian military luck might change or that France might intervene on Austria s side  enlisted the help of the Crown Prince  who had opposed the war but had commanded one of the Prussian armies at Königgrätz  to dissuade his father after stormy meetings  Bismarck insisted on a  soft peace  with no annexations and no victory parades  so as to be able to quickly restore friendly relations with Austria   As a result of the Peace of Prague  1866   the German Confederation was dissolved  Prussia annexed Schleswig  Holstein  Frankfurt  Hanover  Hesse Kassel  and Nassau  Further  Austria promised not to intervene in German affairs  To solidify Prussian hegemony  Prussia forced the 21 states north of the River Main to join it in forming the North German Confederation in 1867  The confederation was governed by a constitution largely drafted by Bismarck  Executive power was vested in a president—a hereditary office of the kings of Prussia  He was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him  As president of the confederation  Wilhelm appointed Bismarck as chancellor of the confederation  Legislation was the responsibility of the Reichstag  a popularly elected body  and the Bundesrat  an advisory body representing the states  The Bundesrat was  in practice  the stronger chamber  Bismarck was the dominant figure in the new arrangement  as Foreign Minister of Prussia  he instructed the Prussian deputies to the Bundesrat  Prussia only had a plurality  17 out of 43 seats  in the Bundesrat despite being larger than the other 21 states combined  but Bismarck could easily control the proceedings through alliances with the smaller states  This began what historians refer to as  The Misery of Austria   in which Austria served as a mere vassal to the superior Germany  a relationship that was to shape history until the two World Wars  Bismarck had originally managed to convince smaller states like Saxony  Hesse Kassel  and Hanover to join Prussia against Austria  after promising them protection from foreign invasion  morale unity  and fair commercial laws   Bismarck  who by now held the rank of major in the Landwehr  wore this uniform during the campaign  and was at last promoted to the rank of major general in the Landwehr cavalry after the war  Although he never personally commanded troops in the field  he usually wore a general s uniform in public for the rest of his life  as seen in numerous paintings and photographs  He was also given a cash grant by the Prussian Landtag  which he used to buy a new country estate  Varzin  larger than his existing estates combined   Military success brought Bismarck tremendous political support in Prussia  In the House of Deputies elections of 1866  the liberals suffered a major defeat  losing their large majority  The new  largely conservative House was on much better terms with Bismarck than previous bodies  at the Minister President s request  it retroactively approved the budgets of the past four years  which had been implemented without parliamentary consent  Bismarck suspected it would split the liberal opposition  While some liberals argued that constitutional government was a bright line that should not be crossed  most of them believed it would be a waste of time to oppose the bill  and supported it in hopes of winning more freedom in the future   5 4  Franco Prussian War 1870–71  Prussia s victory over Austria increased tensions with France  Its emperor  Napoleon III  feared that a powerful Germany would change the balance of power in Europe  opposition politician Adolphe Thiers had observed  it was France  not Austria  who was really defeated at Königgrätz  Bismarck  at the same time  did not avoid war with France  though he feared the French for a number of reasons  First  he feared that Austria  hungry for revenge  would ally with the French  Similarly  he feared that the Russian army would assist France to maintain a balance of power  Still  however  Bismarck believed that if the German states perceived France as the aggressor  they would unite behind the King of Prussia  To achieve this he kept Napoleon III involved in various intrigues whereby France might gain territory from Luxembourg or Belgium—France never achieved any such gain  but it was made to look greedy and untrustworthy   A suitable premise for war arose in 1870  when the German Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen was offered the Spanish throne  vacant since a revolution in 1868  France pressured Leopold into withdrawing his candidacy  Not content with this  Paris demanded that Wilhelm  as head of the House of Hohenzollern  assure that no Hohenzollern would ever seek the Spanish crown again  To provoke France into declaring war with Prussia  Bismarck published the Ems Dispatch  a carefully edited version of a conversation between King Wilhelm and the French ambassador to Prussia  Count Benedetti  This conversation had been edited so that each nation felt that its ambassador had been disrespected and ridiculed  thus inflaming popular sentiment on both sides in favor of war  Langer  however  argues that this episode played a minor role in causing the war   France mobilized and declared war on 19 July  The German states saw France as the aggressor  swept up by nationalism and patriotic zeal  they rallied to Prussia s side and provided troops  Both of Bismarck s sons served as officers in the Prussian cavalry  The war was a great success for Prussia as the German army  controlled by Chief of Staff Moltke  won victory after victory  The major battles were all fought in one month  7 August till 1 September   and both French armies were captured at Sedan and Metz  the latter after a siege of some weeks  Napoleon III was taken prisoner at Sedan and kept in Germany for a time in case Bismarck had need of him to head the French regime  he later died in exile in England in 1873  The remainder of the war featured a siege of Paris  the city was  ineffectually bombarded   the new French republican regime then tried  without success  to relieve Paris with various hastily assembled armies and increasingly bitter partisan warfare   Bismarck acted immediately to secure the unification of Germany  He negotiated with representatives of the southern German states  offering special concessions if they agreed to unification  The negotiations succeeded  patriotic sentiment overwhelmed what opposition remained  While the war was in its final phase Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors in the Château de Versailles  The new German Empire was a federation  each of its 25 constituent states  kingdoms  grand duchies  duchies  principalities  and free cities  retained some autonomy  The King of Prussia  as German Emperor  was not sovereign over the entirety of Germany  he was only primus inter pares  or first among equals  But he held the presidency of the Bundesrat  which met to discuss policy presented by the Chancellor  whom the emperor appointed    At the end  France had to surrender Alsace and part of Lorraine  because Moltke and his generals wanted it as a defensive barrier  Bismarck opposed the annexation because he did not wish to make a permanent enemy of France  France was also required to pay an indemnity  the indemnity figure was calculated  on the basis of population  as the precise equivalent of the indemnity which Napoleon I imposed on Prussia in 1807   6  Chancellor of the German Empire  In 1871  Otto von Bismarck was raised to the rank of Fürst  Prince   He was also appointed as the first Imperial Chancellor  Reichskanzler  of the German Empire  but retained his Prussian offices  including those of Minister President and Foreign Minister   He was also promoted to the rank of lieutenant general  and given another country estate  Friedrichsruh  near Hamburg  which was larger than Varzin  making him a very wealthy landowner  He also continued to serve as his own foreign minister  Because of both the imperial and the Prussian offices that he held  Bismarck had near complete control over domestic and foreign policy  The office of Minister President of Prussia was temporarily separated from that of Chancellor in 1873  when Albrecht von Roon was appointed to the former office  But by the end of the year  Roon resigned due to ill health  and Bismarck again became Minister President   6 1  Kulturkampf  Bismarck launched an anti Catholic Kulturkampf   culture struggle   in Prussia in 1871  This was partly motivated by Bismarck s fear that Pius IX and his successors would use papal infallibility to achieve the  papal desire for international political hegemony      The result was the Kulturkampf  which  with its largely Prussian measures  complemented by similar actions in several other German states  sought to curb the clerical danger by legislation restricting the Catholic church s political power   In May 1872 Bismarck thus attempted to reach an understanding with other European governments to manipulate future papal elections  governments should agree beforehand on unsuitable candidates  and then instruct their national cardinals to vote appropriately  The goal was to end the pope s control over the bishops in a given state  but the project went nowhere   Bismarck accelerated the Kulturkampf  In its course  all Prussian bishops and many priests were imprisoned or exiled  Prussia s population had greatly expanded in the 1860s and was now one third Catholic  Bismarck believed that the pope and bishops held too much power over the German Catholics  he was further concerned about the emergence of the Catholic Centre Party  organised in 1870   With support from the anticlerical National Liberal Party  which had become Bismarck s chief ally in the Reichstag  he abolished the Catholic Department of the Prussian Ministry of Culture  That left the Catholics without a voice in high circles  In 1872  the Jesuits were expelled from Germany  More severe anti Roman Catholic laws of 1873 allowed the Prussian government to supervise the education of the Roman Catholic clergy  and curtailed the disciplinary powers of the Church  In 1875  civil ceremonies were required for civil weddings  Hitherto  weddings in churches were civilly recognized   Kulturkampf became part of Bismarck s foreign policy  as he sought to destabilize and weaken Catholic regimes  especially in Belgium and France   The Catholics reacted by organizing themselves  they strengthened the Centre Party  Bismarck  a devout pietistic Protestant  was alarmed that secularists and socialists were using the Kulturkampf to attack all religion  He abandoned it in 1878 to preserve his remaining political capital  He now needed the Centre Party votes in his new battle against socialism  Pius IX died that year  replaced by the more pragmatic Pope Leo XIII who negotiated away most of the anti Catholic laws  The pope kept control of the selection of bishops  and the Catholics supported unification and most of Bismarck s policies  however they never forgot his culture war and preached solidarity lest it ever happen again   6 2  Economy  In 1873  Germany and much of Europe and America entered the Long Depression  the Gründerkrise  A downturn hit the German economy for the first time since industrial development began to surge in the 1850s  To aid faltering industries  the Chancellor abandoned free trade and established protectionist import tariffs  which alienated the National Liberals who demanded free trade  The Kulturkampf and its effects also stirred up public opinion against the party that supported it  and Bismarck used this opportunity to distance himself from the National Liberals  This marked a rapid decline in the support of the National Liberals  and by 1879 their close ties with Bismarck had all but ended  Bismarck instead returned to conservative factions—including the Centre Party—for support  He helped foster support from the conservatives by enacting several tariffs protecting German agriculture and industry from foreign competitors in 1879   6 3  Germanisation  The government tried to Germanise the state s national minorities  situated mainly in the borders of the empire  such as the Danes in the North of Germany  the French of Alsace Lorraine and the Poles in the East of Germany  He pursued an extremely hostile policy concerning the Poles furthering enmity between the German and Polish peoples  The policies were motivated by Bismarck s view that Polish existence was a threat to the German state  Bismarck compared Polish population to animals that need to be shot and privately confessed that he would like to exterminate them    6 4  Socialism  Worried by the growth of the socialist movement—in particular  that of the Social Democratic Party—Bismarck instituted the Anti Socialist Laws in 1878  Socialist organizations and meetings were forbidden  as was the circulation of socialist literature  Police officers could stop  search  and arrest socialist party members  socialist leaders were arrested and tried by police courts  But despite these efforts  the movement steadily gained supporters and seats in the Reichstag  Socialists won seats in the Reichstag by running as independent candidates  unaffiliated with any party  which was allowed by the German Constitution   7  Foreign policies  Bismarck had unified his nation  and now he devoted himself to promoting peace in Europe with his skills in statesmanship  He was forced to contend with French revanchism—the desire to avenge the losses of the Franco Prussian War  Bismarck therefore engaged in a policy of diplomatically isolating France while maintaining cordial relations with other nations in Europe  He had little interest in naval or colonial entanglements and thus avoided discord with Great Britain  Historians emphasize that he wanted no more territorial gains after 1871  and vigorously worked to form cross linking alliances that prevented any war in Europe from starting  A  J  P  Taylor  a leading British diplomatic historian  concludes that   Bismarck was an honest broker of peace  and his system of alliances compelled every Power  whatever its will  to follow a peaceful course    Well aware that Europe was skeptical of his powerful new Reich  Bismarck turned his attention to preserving peace in Europe based on a balance of power that would allow Germany s economy to flourish  Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria  France  and Russia would crush Germany  If two of them were allied  then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands  The solution was to ally with two of the three  In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors  an alliance of Wilhelm  Czar Alexander II of Russia  and Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria Hungary  Together they would control Eastern Europe  making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control  The Balkans posed a more serious issue  and Bismarck s solution was to give Austria predominance in the western Balkan areas  and Russia in the eastern areas  The system collapsed in 1887   In 1872  a protracted quarrel began to fester between Bismarck and Count Harry von Arnim  the imperial ambassador to France  Arnim saw himself as a rival and competitor for the chancellorship  but the rivalry escalated out of hand  and Arnim took sensitive records from embassy files at Paris to back up his case  He was formally accused of misappropriating official documents  indicted  tried  and convicted  and fled into exile  where he died  No one again openly challenged Bismarck in foreign policy matters until his resignation   7 1  France  Between 1873 and 1877  according to Stone  1994   Germany repeatedly acted the bully against France by manipulating the internal affairs of France s neighbors to hurt it  Bismarck put heavy pressure on Belgium  Spain  and Italy hoping to obtain the election of liberal  anticlerical governments  His plan was to promote republicanism in France by isolating the clerical monarchist regime of President MacMahon  He hoped that ringing France with liberal states would help the French republicans defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters   The bullying almost got out of hand with a brief war scare in mid 1875  It was sparked by an editorial entitled  Krieg in Sicht    War in Sight   in a Berlin newspaper close to the government  the Post  It indicated that highly influential Germans were alarmed by France s rapid recovery from defeat in 1875 and its announcement of an increase in the size of its army  They talked of launching a preventive war against France to hold it down  Bismarck denied knowing about the article ahead of time  but he certainly knew about the talk of preventive war  The editorial produced a war scare  Britain and Russia made it clear they would not tolerate a preventive war against France  Bismarck did not want any war either  and the crisis blew over  It was a rare instance where his opponents outmaneuvered and embarrassed Bismarck  but he learned an important lesson  It forced him to take into account the fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany s fast growing power was causing among its neighbors  The crisis reinforced Bismarck s determination that Germany should work in proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe  rather than passively let events take their own course and react to them   7 2  Italy  Bismarck maintained good relations with Italy  although he had a personal dislike for Italians and their country  He can be seen as a marginal contributor to Italian unification  Politics surrounding the 1866 war against Austria allowed Italy to annex Venetia  which had been a kingdom of the Austrian Empire since the 1815 Congress of Vienna  In addition  French mobilization for the Franco Prussian War of 1870–1871 made it necessary for Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Rome and The Papal States  Without these two events  Italian unification would have been a more prolonged process   7 3  Russia  After Russia s victory over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo Turkish War of 1877–78  Bismarck helped negotiate a settlement at the Congress of Berlin  The Treaty of Berlin revised the earlier Treaty of San Stefano  reducing the size of newly independent Bulgaria  a pro Russian state at that time   Bismarck and other European leaders opposed the growth of Russian influence and tried to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire  see Eastern Question   As a result  Russo German relations further suffered  with the Russian chancellor Gorchakov denouncing Bismarck for compromising his nation s victory  The relationship was additionally strained due to Germany s protectionist trade policies  Some in the German military clamored for a preemptive war with Russia  but Bismarck said that  Preemptive war is like committing suicide for fear of death    7 4  Triple Alliance  The League of the Three Emperors having fallen apart  Bismarck negotiated the Dual Alliance with Austria Hungary  in which each guaranteed the other against Russian attack  He also negotiated the Triple Alliance in 1882 with Austria Hungary and Italy  this was a completely different Alliance to the Dual Alliance  Italy and Austria Hungary soon reached the  Mediterranean Agreement  with Britain  Attempts to reconcile Germany and Russia did not have lasting effect  the Three Emperors  League was re established in 1881  but quickly fell apart  the end of the Russian Austrian Prussian solidarity which had existed in various forms since 1813   Bismarck therefore negotiated the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 with Russia  in order to prevent the Bismarckian Nightmare of a Franco Russian Encirclement  Both powers promised to remain neutral towards one another unless Russia attacked Austria Hungary  However  the Reinsurance Treaty failed to be renewed by Wilhelm II in 1890 after Bismarck s departure from office  thus creating a critical problem for Germany in the event of a war   7 5  Colonies  Bismarck had opposed colonial acquisitions  arguing that the burden of obtaining  maintaining  and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefit  He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves  that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the easy going tropics  and that the diplomatic disputes colonies brought would distract Germany from its central interest  Europe itself  However  in 1883–84 he suddenly reversed himself and overnight built a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific  Historians have debated exactly why he made this sudden and short lived move  He was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige  He also wanted to undercut the anti colonial liberals who were sponsored by the Crown Prince  who might soon become Kaiser and remove Bismarck  The old Kaiser was 84 years old  Bismarck was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders  his neighbors at Friedrichsruh  The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly  starting with German New Guinea in 1884  Other European nations  led by Britain and France  were acquiring colonies in a rapid fashion  see New Imperialism   Bismarck therefore joined in the Scramble for Africa  Germany s new colonies included Togoland  now Togo and part of Ghana   German Kamerun  now Cameroon and part of Nigeria   German East Africa  now Rwanda  Burundi  and the mainland part of Tanzania   and German South West Africa  now Namibia   The Berlin Conference  1884–85  established regulations for the acquisition of African colonies  in particular  it protected free trade in certain parts of the Congo basin  Germany also acquired colonies in the Pacific  such as German New Guinea   7 6  Avoiding war  In February 1888  during a Bulgarian crisis  Bismarck addressed the Reichstag on the dangers of a European war   Bismarck also repeated his emphatic warning against any German military involvement in Balkan disputes  Bismarck had first made this famous comment to the Reichstag in December 1876  when the Balkan revolts against the Ottoman Empire threatened to extend to a war between Austria and Russia   A leading diplomatic historian of the era  William L  Langer sums up Bismark s two decades as Chancellor   Whatever else may be said of the intricate alliance system evolved by the German Chancellor  it must be admitted that it worked and that it tided Europe over a period of several critical years without a rupture      there was  as Bismarck himself said  a premium upon the maintenance of peace  Langer concludes   His had been a great career  beginning with three wars in eight years and ending with a period of 20 years during which he worked for the peace of Europe  despite countless opportunities to embark on further enterprises with more than even chance of success      No other statesman of his standing had ever before shown the same great moderation and sound political sense of the possible and desirable      Bismarck at least deserves full credit for having steered European politics through this dangerous transitional period without serious conflict between the great powers    8  Social legislation  Bismarck implemented the world s first welfare state in the 1880s  He worked closely with large industry and aimed to stimulate German economic growth by giving workers greater security  A secondary concern was trumping the Socialists  who had no welfare proposals of their own and opposed Bismarck s  Bismarck especially listened to Hermann Wagener and Theodor Lohmann  advisers who persuaded him to give workers a corporate status in the legal and political structures of the new German state  In March 1884  Bismarck declared   Bismarck s idea was to implement welfare programs that were acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects  He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace  such as safe working conditions  limitation of work hours  and the regulation of women s and child labor  He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production  and thus harm the economy  Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag  using the term practical Christianity to describe his program  Bismarck s program centered squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity  and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers  government  The program included sickness insurance  accident insurance  disability insurance  and a retirement pension  none of which were then in existence to any great degree   Based on Bismarck s message  the Reichstag filed three bills to deal with the concepts of accident and sickness insurance  The subjects of retirement pensions and disability insurance were placed on the back burner for the time being  The social legislation implemented by Bismarck in the 1880s played a key role in the sharp  rapid decline of German emigration to America  Young men considering emigration looked at not only the gap between higher hourly  direct wages  in the United States and Germany but also the differential in  indirect wages —social benefits  which favored staying in Germany  The young men went to German industrial cities  so that Bismarck s insurance system partly offset low wage rates in Germany and furthered the fall of the emigration rate   8 1  Sickness Insurance Law of 1883  The first bill that had success was the Sickness Insurance Bill  which was passed in 1883  Bismarck considered the program the least important and the least politically troublesome  The program was established to provide sickness insurance for German industrial laborers  The health service was established on a local basis  with the cost divided between employers and the employed  The employers contributed 1 3  while the workers contributed 2 3s  The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed  The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected by the members of each bureau  and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution  This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats who—through heavy Worker membership—achieved their first small foothold in public administration   8 2  Accident Insurance Law of 1884  Bismarck s government had to submit three draft bills before they could get one passed by the Reichstag in 1884  Bismarck had originally proposed that the Federal Government pay a portion of the Accident Insurance contribution  Bismarck s motive was a demonstration of the willingness of the German government to lessen the hardship experienced by the German workers as a means of weaning them away from the various left wing parties  most importantly the Social Democrats  The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of State Socialism  which they were dead set against  The Center party was afraid of the expansion of Federal Power at the expense of States Rights  As a result  the only way the program could be passed at all was for the entire expense to be underwritten by the Employers  To facilitate this  Bismarck arranged for the administration of this program to be placed in the hands of  Der Arbeitgeberverband in den beruflichen Korporationen   the Organization of Employers in Occupational Corporations   This organization established central and bureaucratic insurance offices on the Federal  and in some cases the State level to perform the actual administration  The program kicked in to replace the sickness insurance program as of the 14th week  It paid for medical treatment and a Pension of up to 2 3s of earned wages if the worker was fully disabled  This program was expanded in 1886 to include Agricultural workers   8 3  Old Age and Disability Insurance Law of 1889  The Old Age Pension program  an insurance equally financed by employers and workers  was designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached age 70 years  Unlike the Accident Insurance and Sickness Insurance programs  this program covered all categories of workers—industrial  agrarian  artisans and servants from the start  Also  unlike the other two programs  the principle that the national government should contribute a portion of the underwriting cost  with the other two portions prorated accordingly  was accepted without question  The Disability Insurance program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled  This time  the State or Province supervised the programs directly   9  Forced to resign  In 1888  the German Emperor  Wilhelm I  died leaving the throne to his son  Friedrich III  The new monarch was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and died after reigning for only 99 days  He was succeeded by his son  Wilhelm II  who opposed Bismarck s careful foreign policy  preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to enlarge Germany s  place in the sun    Bismarck was 16 years older than Friedrich  Before the latter became terminally ill  Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne  and thus had no strategy to deal with him  Conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship  Perhaps on account of his prominent role in Wilhelm s upbringing  Bismarck believed that he could dominate the young Kaiser and showed little respect for his policies in the late 1880s  However  Wilhelm wanted to be his own master and was surrounded by sycophants telling him that Frederick the Great would not have been so great with a Bismarck at his side  Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far reaching anti Socialist laws in early 1890  The Kartell majority in the Reichstag  of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party  was willing to make most of the laws permanent  But it was split about the law allowing the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes  a power used excessively at times against political opponents  The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent  while the Conservatives supported only the entirety of the bill and threatened to and eventually vetoed the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill   As the debate continued  Wilhelm became increasingly interested in social problems  especially the treatment of mine workers during their strike in 1889  and keeping with his active policy in government  routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear his social policy  Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm s policy and worked to circumvent it  Even though Wilhelm supported the altered anti socialist bill  Bismarck pushed for his support to veto the bill in its entirety  But when his arguments could not convince Wilhelm  Bismarck became excited and agitated until uncharacteristically blurting out his motive to see the bill fail  to have the socialists agitate until a violent clash occurred that could be used as a pretext to crush them  Wilhelm replied that he was not willing to open his reign with a bloody campaign against his own subjects  The next day  after realizing his blunder  Bismarck attempted to reach a compromise with Wilhelm by agreeing to his social policy towards industrial workers  and even suggested a European council to discuss working conditions  presided over by the German Emperor   Despite this  a turn of events eventually led to his distancing from Wilhelm  Bismarck  feeling pressured and unappreciated by the Emperor and undermined by ambitious advisers  refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm  as was required by the German Constitution  to protest Wilhelm s ever increasing interference to Bismarck s previously unquestioned authority  Bismarck also worked behind the scenes to break the Continental labour council on which Wilhelm had set his heart   The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority  with his Kartell voted from power due to the anti socialist bill fiasco  The remaining forces in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party  Bismarck wished to form a new block with the Centre Party  and invited Ludwig Windthorst  the parliamentary leader  to discuss an alliance  This would be Bismarck s last political manoeuvre  Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst s visit  In a parliamentary state  the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority  and certainly has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority  However  in Germany  the Chancellor depended on the confidence of the Emperor alone  and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his minister s meeting  After a heated argument in Bismarck s office Wilhelm  whom Bismarck had allowed to see a letter from Tsar Alexander III describing him as a  badly brought up boy   stormed out  after first ordering the rescinding of the Cabinet Order of 1851  which had forbidden Prussian Cabinet Ministers to report directly to the King of Prussia  requiring them instead to report via the Prime Minister  Bismarck  forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage  wrote a blistering letter of resignation  decrying Wilhelm s interference in foreign and domestic policy  which was published only after Bismarck s death   Bismarck resigned at Wilhelm II s insistence on 18 March 1890  at age 75  to be succeeded as Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia by Leo von Caprivi  Bismarck was discarded   dropping the pilot   in the words of the famous Punch cartoon   promoted to the rank of  Colonel General with the Dignity of Field Marshal   so called because the German Army did not appoint full Field Marshals in peacetime  and given a new title  Duke of Lauenburg  which he joked would be useful when travelling incognito  He was soon elected to the Reichstag as a National Liberal in Bennigsen s old and supposedly safe Hamburg seat  but he was embarrassed by being taken to a second ballot by a Social Democrat opponent  and never actually took up his seat  He entered into a restless  resentful retirement on his estates at Varzin  now part of Poland  Within one month of his wife s death on 27 November 1894  he moved to Friedrichsruh near Hamburg  waiting in vain to be called upon for advice and counsel   9 1  Last warning and prediction  In December 1897  the Emperor Wilhelm II visited Bismarck for the last time  Bismarck again warned him about the dangers of improvising government policy based on the intrigues of courtiers and militarists  Bismarck s last warning was   Subsequently  Bismarck made this prediction   According to Albert Ballin  the year before he died Bismarck told him   9 2  Death  Bismarck spent his final years composing his memoirs  Gedanken und Erinnerungen  or Thoughts and Memories   a work of literary genius but questionable accuracy  in which he increased the drama around every event and always presented himself favorably  He died in July 1898 at the age of 83 in Friedrichsruh  where he is entombed in the Bismarck Mausoleum  He was succeeded as Fürst von Bismarck Schönhausen by his son Herbert  He continued his feud with Wilhelm II by attacking him in his memoirs and by publishing the text of the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia  a breach of national security for which any individual of lesser status would have been prosecuted   Bismarck managed one final attack on Wilhelm II by having his tombstone inscribed with the words  Here lies a true servant of the Emperor Wilhelm I    10  Legacy and memory  Historians have reached a broad consensus on the content  function and importance of the image of Bismarck within Germany s political culture over the past 125 years  According to Steinberg  his achievements in 1862–71 were  the greatest diplomatic and political achievement by any leader in the last two centuries    Bismarck s most important legacy is the unification of Germany  Germany had existed as a collection of hundreds of separate principalities and Free Cities since the formation of the Holy Roman Empire  Over the centuries various rulers had tried to unify the German states without success until Bismarck  Largely as a result of Bismarck s efforts  the various German kingdoms were united into a single country   Following unification  Germany became one of the most powerful nations in Europe  Bismarck s astute  cautious  and pragmatic foreign policies allowed Germany to retain peacefully the powerful position into which he had brought it  maintaining amiable diplomacy with almost all European nations  France  the main exception  was devastated by Bismarck s wars and his harsh subsequent policies towards it  France became one of Germany s most bitter enemies in Europe  Austria  too  was weakened by the creation of a German Empire  though to a much lesser extent than France  Bismarck believed that as long as Britain  Russia and Italy were assured of the peaceful nature of the German Empire  French belligerency could be contained  his diplomatic feats were undone  however  by Kaiser Wilhelm II  whose policies unified other European powers against Germany in time for World War I   Historians stress that Bismarck s peace oriented   saturated continental diplomacy  was increasingly unpopular  because it consciously reined in any expansionist drives  In dramatic contrast stands the ambition of Wilhelm II s Weltpolitik to secure the Reich s future through expansion  leading to World War I  Likewise Bismarck s policy to deny the military a dominant voice in foreign political decision making was overturned by 1914 as Germany became an armed state   Bismarck s psychology and personal traits have not been so favourably received by scholars  The American historian Jonathan Steinberg portrays a malign genius who was deeply vengeful  even toward his closest friends and family members  Evans says he was  intimidating and unscrupulous  playing to others  frailties  not their strengths   British historians  including Evans  Taylor  Palmer and Crankshaw  see Bismarck as an ambivalent figure  undoubtedly a man of great skill but who left no lasting system in place to guide successors less skilled than himself  Being a committed monarchist himself  Bismarck allowed no effective constitutional check on the power of the Emperor  thus placing a time bomb in the foundation of the Germany that he created   Observers at the time and ever since have commented on Bismarck s skill as a writer  As Henry Kissinger has noted   The man of  blood and iron  wrote prose of extraordinary directness and lucidity  comparable in distinctiveness to Churchill s use of the English language    During most of his nearly 30 year long tenure  Bismarck held undisputed control over the government s policies  He was well supported by his friend Albrecht von Roon  the war minister  as well as the leader of the Prussian army Helmuth von Moltke  Bismarck s diplomatic moves relied on a victorious Prussian military  and these two men gave Bismarck the victories he needed to convince the smaller German states to join Prussia   Bismarck took steps to silence or restrain political opposition  as evidenced by laws restricting the freedom of the press  and the anti socialist laws  He waged a culture war  Kulturkampf  against the Catholic Church until he realized the conservatism of the Catholics made them natural allies against the Socialists  His king Wilhelm I rarely challenged the Chancellor s decisions  on several occasions  Bismarck obtained his monarch s approval by threatening to resign  However  Wilhelm II intended to govern the country himself  making the ousting of Bismarck one of his first tasks as Kaiser  Bismarck s successors as Chancellor were much less influential  as power was concentrated in the Emperor s hands   10 1  Memorials  Immediately after he left office  citizens started to praise him and established funds to build monuments like the Bismarck Memorial or towers dedicated to him  Throughout Germany  the accolades were unending  several buildings were named in his honour  portraits of him were commissioned from artists such as Franz von Lenbach and C W  Allers and books about him became best sellers  The first monument built in his honour was the one at Bad Kissingen erected in 1877   Numerous statues and memorials dot the cities  towns  and countryside of Germany  including the famous Bismarck Memorial in Berlin and numerous Bismarck towers on four continents  The only memorial depicting him as a student at Göttingen University  together with a dog  possibly his Reichshund Tyras  and as a member of his Corps Hannovera was re erected in 2006 at the Rudelsburg  The gleaming white 1906 Bismarck Monument in the city of Hamburg  stands in the centre of the St  Pauli district  and is the largest  and probably best known  memorial to Bismarck worldwide  The statues depicted him as massive  monolithic  rigid and unambiguous  Two warships were named in his honour  the of the German Imperial Navy  and the from the World War II–era   10 2  Bismarck myth  Gerwarth  2007  shows that the Bismarck myth  built up predominantly during his years of retirement and even more stridently after his death  proved a powerful rhetorical and ideological tool  The myth made him out to be a dogmatic ideologue and ardent nationalist when  in fact  he was ideologically flexible  Gerwarth argues that the constructed memory of Bismarck played a central role as an anti democratic myth in the highly ideological battle over the past which raged between 1918 and 1933  This myth proved to be a weapon against the Weimar Republic  and exercised a destructive influence on the political culture of the first German democracy  Frankel  2005  shows the Bismarck cult fostered and legitimized a new style of right wing politics  and made possible the post Bismarckian crisis of leadership  both real and perceived  that had Germans seeking the strongest possible leader and asking   What Would Bismarck Do    For example  Hamburg s memorial  unveiled in 1906  is considered one of the greatest expressions of imperial Germany s Bismarck cult and an important development in the history of German memorial art  It was a product of the desire of Hamburg s patrician classes to defend their political privileges in the face of dramatic social change and attendant demands for political reform  To those who presided over its construction  the monument was also a means of asserting Hamburg s cultural aspirations and of shrugging off a reputation as a city hostile to the arts  The memorial was greeted with widespread disapproval among the working classes and did not prevent their increasing support for the Social Democrats   11  Place names  A number of localities around the world have been named in Bismarck s honour  They include   Bismarck Archipelago  near the former German colony of New Guinea   Bismarck  Illinois  Bismarck  North Dakota  a city and state capital in the United States   Bismarck  Missouri  a city in Missouri   Bismarck Sea  Bismarck Strait  a channel in Antarctica   Bismarckburg  Kasanga  Tanzania   12  Titles and styles from birth to death  1 April 1815 – 1865  Junker Otto von Bismarck  1865–1871  High Born Count Otto of Bismarck Schönhausen  1871–1890  His Serene Highness The Prince of Bismarck  1890 – 30 July 1898  His Serene Highness The Prince of Bismarck  Duke of Lauenburg Bismarck was created Graf von Bismarck Schönhausen   Count of Bismarck Schönhausen   in 1865  this comital title is borne by all his descendants in the male line  In 1871  he was further created Fürst von Bismarck   Prince of Bismarck   and accorded the style of Durchlaucht  equivalent to  Serene Highness    this princely title descended only to his eldest male heirs   12 1  Duke of Lauenburg  In 1890  Bismarck was created further Herzog von Lauenburg   Duke of Lauenburg   the Duchy was one of the territories which Prussia seized from the Danish king in 1864    It was Bismarck s ambition to be assimilated into the mediatized houses of Germany  He attempted to persuade Kaiser Wilhelm I that he should be endowed with the sovereign duchy of Lauenburg  in reward for his services to the imperial family and the German empire  This was on the understanding that Bismarck would immediately restore the duchy to Prussia  all that he wanted was the privilege of a mediatized family for himself and his descendants  This novel idea was turned down by the conservative emperor  who thought that he had already given the chancellor enough rewards  There is reason to believe that he informed Wilhelm II of his wishes  After being forced by the sovereign to resign  he received the purely honorific title of  Duke of Lauenburg   without the duchy itself and the sovereignty that would have transformed his family into a mediatized house  Bismarck regarded it as a mockery of his ambition  and he considered nothing more cruel than this action of the emperor   On Bismarck s death in 1898  his dukedom  held only for his own lifetime  was extinguished and the princely title passed to his eldest son  Herbert   13  See also  Adelbert Theodor
