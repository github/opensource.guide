In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives    For a bet for value to be correct  a player must have a positive expectation  that is  he will win more than one bet for every bet he puts in the pot  Note that pot odds do not matter in this situation  because the factor here is whether it is more profitable to raise or call  rather than to call or fold  Betting for value can apply to both made hand and drawing hand situations  although in the latter situation it is less often correct  as the drawing hand s chances of winning are generally lower  Many made hands will win the pot more than 50% of the time  therefore a value bet is usually correct  even heads up   For example  in a game of Texas hold  em  a player has 8♣ 6♠ with a flop of 9♥ 7♦ 2♣  The player has an open ended straight draw and so has eight outs  four 10s and four 5s   With 47 unknown cards  the player will make the straight approximately one time for every five times he doesn t  thus a bet is profitable if six or more of his opponents will call the bet  he will win once  +6 bets  and lose five times   5 bets  out of every six hands like this  resulting in an expectation of +1 bet   If he thinks that fewer than six opponents will call the bet  he would lose money and must simply call   1  See also  Poker strategy  Betting  poker
