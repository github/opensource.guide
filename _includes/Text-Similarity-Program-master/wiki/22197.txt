Open content is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998 which describes a creative work that others can copy or modify  The term evokes open source software  which is a related concept in software   When the term OpenContent was first used by Wiley  it described works licensed under the Open Content License  a non free share alike license  see  Free content  below  and perhaps other works licensed under similar terms  It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions  The openness of content can be assessed under the  5Rs Framework  based on the extent to which it can be reused  revised  remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law  Unlike open source and free content  there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as  open content    Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright  open content licenses rely on a copyright holder s power to license their work   1  Definition  The OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as  freely available for modification  use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the Open Source   Free Software community   However  such a definition would exclude the Open Content License  OPL  because that license forbade charging  a fee for the  OpenContent  itself   a right required by free and open source software licenses   The term since shifted in meaning  OpenContent  is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities    The 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open   Retain   the right to make  own  and control copies of the content  e g   download  duplicate  store  and manage   Reuse   the right to use the content in a wide range of ways  e g   in a class  in a study group  on a website  in a video   Revise   the right to adapt  adjust  modify  or alter the content itself  e g   translate the content into another language   Remix   the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new  e g   incorporate the content into a mashup   Redistribute   the right to share copies of the original content  your revisions  or your remixes with others  e g   give a copy of the content to a friend  This broader definition distinguishes open content from open source software  since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public  However  it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources  which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses   The Open Definition  which purports to define open content and open knowledge  draws heavily on the Open Source Definition  it preserves the limited sense of open content as libre content   2  Open access   Open access  refers to toll free or gratis access to content  consisting mainly of published peer reviewed scholarly journal articles  Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution  which would qualify them as open content   3  Open content and education  Over the past decade  open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education  Traditional universities are expensive  and their tuition rates are increasing  Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is  focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content   There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content  including OpenCourseWare Initiative  The Saylor Foundation and Khan Academy  Some universities  like MIT  Yale  and Tufts are making their courses freely available on the internet   3 1  Textbooks  The textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact  Traditional textbooks  aside from being expensive can also be inconvenient and out of date  because of publishers  tendency to constantly print new editions  Open textbooks help to eliminate this problem  because they are online and thus easily updatable  Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers  because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher s unique curriculum  There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks  Some of these organizations and projects include   Connexions  OpenStax College  and Wikibooks  For more information on open content as it relates to education and textbooks see Open Education Resources   4  Licenses  According to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website  any general  royalty free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it  provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law  These permissions are granted to users free of charge    However  the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to libre content  any free content license would qualify as an open content license  According to this narrower criteria  the following still maintained licenses qualify   Creative Commons licenses  only Creative Commons Attribution  Attribution Share Alike and Zero   Open Publication License  the original license of the Open Content Project  the Open Content License  did not permit for profit copying of the licensed work and therefore does not qualify   Against DRM license  GNU Free Documentation License  Open Game License  a license designed for role playing games by Wizards of the Coast   Free Art License  5  See also  Digital freedom  Free content  Free culture movement
