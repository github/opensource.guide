Weather is the state of the atmosphere  to the degree that it is hot or cold  wet or dry  calm or stormy  clear or cloudy  Weather  seen from an anthropological perspective  is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses  at least while being outside  There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is  what makes it change  what effects it has on humans in different situations etc  Therefore weather is something people often communicate about  Turning back to the meteorological perspective  most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere  just below the stratosphere  Weather generally refers to day to day temperature and precipitation activity  whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time  When used without qualification   weather  is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth   Weather is driven by air pressure  temperature and moisture  differences between one place and another  These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot  which varies by latitude from the tropics  The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream  Weather systems in the mid latitudes  such as extratropical cyclones  are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow  Because the Earth s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane  sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year  On Earth s surface  temperatures usually range ±40 °C  −40 °F to 100 °F  annually  Over thousands of years  changes in Earth s orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth  thus influencing long term climate and global climate change   Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location  The system is a chaotic system  so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole  Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history  and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns   Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth  A famous landmark in the Solar System  Jupiter s Great Red Spot  is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years  However  weather is not limited to planetary bodies  A star s corona is constantly being lost to space  creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System  The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind   1  Causes  On Earth  the common weather phenomena include wind  cloud  rain  snow  fog and dust storms  Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes  hurricanes  typhoons and ice storms  Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere  the lower part of the atmosphere   Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere  but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood   Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure  temperature and moisture  differences between one place to another  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot  which varies by latitude from the tropics  In other words  the farther from the tropics one lies  the lower the sun angle is  which causes those locations to be cooler due to the indirect sunlight  The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream  Weather systems in the mid latitudes  such as extratropical cyclones  are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow  see baroclinity   Weather systems in the tropics  such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems  are caused by different processes   Because the Earth s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane  sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year  In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun  so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December  see Effect of sun angle on climate   This effect causes seasons  Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years  changes in Earth s orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long term climate   See Milankovitch cycles    The uneven solar heating  the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients  or frontogenesis  can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes  which is explained by the lapse rate  On local scales  temperature differences can occur because different surfaces  such as oceans  forests  ice sheets  or man made objects  have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity  roughness  or moisture content   Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences  A hot surface heats the air above it raising the pressure of the air  Combined gas law  and causing it to expand which then lowers the air pressure and its density  The resulting horizontal pressure gradient accelerates the air from high to low pressure  creating wind  and Earth s rotation then causes curvature of the flow via the Coriolis effect  The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes   The atmosphere is a chaotic system  so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole  This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance  though weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through the scientific study of weather  meteorology  It is theoretically impossible to make useful day to day predictions more than about two weeks ahead  imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill   2  Shaping the planet Earth  Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth  The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances  During rains precipitation  the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air  This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic  which aids the erosive properties of water  The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further  such as acid rain   and sodium and chloride ions  salt  deposited in the seas oceans  The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils  In this way  weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface   3  Major Wind and Pressure Systems and Related Weather  4  Effect on humans  4 1  Effects on populations  Weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history  Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations  for example the desertification of the Middle East  and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods   extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events  One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281  French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet  allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline  More recently  Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States  becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the United States   The Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe  The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages  Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697  during which about one third of the Finnish population died   5  Forecasting  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location  Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia  and formally since at least the nineteenth century  Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve   Once an all human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure  current weather conditions  and sky condition  forecast models are now used to determine future conditions  Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon  which involves pattern recognition skills  teleconnections  knowledge of model performance  and knowledge of model biases  The chaotic nature of the atmosphere  the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere  error involved in measuring the initial conditions  and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases  The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome   There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts  Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property  Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture  and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets  Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days  On an everyday basis  people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day  Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain  snow and the wind chill  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events  and to plan ahead and survive them   6  Modification  The aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history  from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U S  Military Operation Popeye  an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon  The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding  they include the fog  and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports  techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains  and techniques to suppress hail  A recent example of weather control was China s preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games  China shot 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008  Guo Hu  head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau  BMB   confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province  to the southwest and Beijing s Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters   Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques  efficacy  there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification   Acid rain  caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere  adversely affects freshwater lakes  vegetation  and structures   Anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility   Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought  extreme temperatures  flooding  high winds  and severe storms  However  some experts argue these claims are unfounded and take issue with these conclusions   Heat  generated by large metropolitan areas have been shown to minutely affect nearby weather  even at distances as far as   The effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization  including ecosystems  natural resources  food and fiber production  economic development  and human health   7  Microscale meteorology  Microscale meteorology is the study of short lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale  about 1 km or less  These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as  mesoscale and microscale meteorology   MMM  and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale  that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map  These include small and generally fleeting cloud  puffs  and other small cloud features   8  Extremes on Earth  On Earth  temperatures usually range ±40 °C  100 °F to −40 °F  annually  The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range  The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is   at Vostok Station  Antarctica on 21 July 1983  The hottest air temperature ever recorded was at  Aziziya  Libya  on 13 September 1922  but that reading is queried  The highest recorded average annual temperature was at Dallol  Ethiopia  The coldest recorded average annual temperature was at Vostok Station  Antarctica   The coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at Eureka  Nunavut  in Canada  where the annual average temperature is    9  Extraterrestrial within the Solar System  Studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth  Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth  but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition  The Cassini–Huygens mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds  Earth s atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones  three in each hemisphere  In contrast  Jupiter s banded appearance shows many such zones  Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude  and Venus has a single jet near the equator   One of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System  Jupiter s Great Red Spot  is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years  On other gas giants  the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds  gusts of up to 600 metres per second  about   have been measured on the planet Neptune  This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists  The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about of that received by Earth  yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth  The strongest planetary winds discovered so far are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b  which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than    10  Space weather  Weather is not limited to planetary bodies  Like all stars  the sun s corona is constantly being lost to space  creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System  The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind  Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star  such as coronal mass ejections  form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems  such as pressure and wind  and is generally known as space weather  Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the solar system as Saturn  The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces  The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae  and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals   11  See also  Weather station  Personal weather station  Outline of
