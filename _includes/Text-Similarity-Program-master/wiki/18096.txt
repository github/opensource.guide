Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov      18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918  was a military intelligence officer  explorer  and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair  an unsuccessful endeavor in August September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky s Provisional Government  but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d état  and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky  strengthening the claims and power of the soviets  and the Bolshevik party   1  Pre revolutionary career  One story relates how Kornilov was originally born as a Don Cossack Kalmyk named Lorya Dildinov and adopted in Ust Kamenogorsk  Russian Turkestan  now Kazakhstan  by the family of his mother s brother  the Russian Cossack Chorąży George Kornilov  whose wife was of Kazakh origin  But his sister wrote that he had not been adopted  had not been a Don Cossack  and that their mother had Polish and Altai Oirot descent   Though their language was not a Kalmyk Mongolian one  but because of their Asian race and their history in the Jungar Oirot  Kalmyk  state  Altai Oirots were called Altai Kalmyks by Russians  They were not Muslims or Kazakhs   But Boris Shaposhnikov  who served with Petr Kornilov  the brother of Lavr  in 1903  mentioned the  Kyrgyz  ancestry of their mother   this name was usually used in reference to Kazakhs in 1903  Kornilov s Siberian Cossack father was a friend of Potanin  1835 1920   a prominent figure in the Siberian autonomy movement   Kornilov entered military school in Omsk in 1885 and went on to study at the Mikhailovsky Artillery School in St  Petersburg in 1889  In August 1892 he was assigned as a lieutenant to the Turkestan Military District  where he led several exploration missions in Eastern Turkestan  Afghanistan and Persia  learned several Central Asian languages  and wrote detailed reports about his observations   Kornilov returned to St  Petersburg to attend the Mykolayiv General Staff Academy and graduated as a captain in 1897  Again refusing a posting at St  Peterburg  he returned to the Turkestan Military District  where he resumed his duties as a military intelligence officer   During the Russo Japanese War of 1904 1905 Kornilov became the Chief of staff of the 1st Infantry Brigade  and was heavily involved in the Battle of Sandepu  January 1905  and the Battle of Mukden  February March 1905   He was awarded the Order of St  George  4th class  for bravery and promoted to the rank of colonel   Following the end of the war  Kornilov served as military attache in China from 1907 to 1911  He studied the Chinese language  traveled extensively  researching data on the history  traditions and customs of the Chinese  which he intended to use as material for a book about life in contemporary China   and regularly sent detailed reports to the General Staff and Foreign Ministry  Kornilov paid much attention to the prospects of cooperation between Russia and China in the Far East and met with the future president of China  Chiang Kai shek  In 1910 Kornilov was recalled from Beijing  but remained in St  Petersburg for only five months before departing for western Mongolia and Kashgar to examine the military situation along China s border with Russia  On 2 February 1911 he became Commander of the 8th Infantry Regiment of Estonia  and was later appointed commander of the 9th Siberian Rifle Division  stationed in Vladivostok   In 1914  at the start of World War I  Kornilov was appointed commander of the 48th Infantry Division  which saw combat in Galicia and the Carpathians  In 1915  he was promoted to the rank of major general  During heavy fighting  he was captured by the Austrians in April 1915  when his division became isolated from the rest of the Russian forces  After his capture  Field Marshal Conrad  the commander of the Austro Hungarian Army  made a point of meeting him in person  As a major general  he was a high value prisoner of war  but in July 1916 Kornilov managed to escape back to Russia and return to duty   Kornilov was critical of the Russian monarchy and  after the overthrow of Czar Nicholas II he was given command of the Petrograd Military District in March 1917  In July  after commanding the only successful front in the disastrous Russian offensive of June 1917  he became Supreme Commander in Chief of the Provisional Government s armed forces   2  Kornilov Affair  In the mass discontent following the July Days  the Russian populace grew highly sceptical of the Provisional Government s abilities to alleviate the economic distress and social resentment among the lower classes  Pavel Milyukov  the Kadet leader  describes the situation in Russia in late July as   Chaos in the army  chaos in foreign policy  chaos in industry and chaos in the nationalist questions   Kornilov  appointed commander in chief of the Russian army in July 1917  considered the Petrograd Soviet responsible for the breakdown in the military in recent times  and believed that the Provisional Government lacked the power and confidence to dissolve the Petrograd Soviet  Following several ambiguous correspondences between Kornilov and Alexander Kerensky  Kornilov commanded an assault on the Petrograd Soviet   Because the Petrograd Soviet was able to quickly gather a powerful army of workers and soldiers in defence of the Revolution  Kornilov s coup was an abysmal failure and he was placed under arrest  The Kornilov Affair resulted in significantly increased distrust among Russians towards the Provisional Government   3  Russian Civil War  After the alleged coup collapsed as his troops disintegrated  Kornilov and his fellow conspirators were placed under arrest in the Bykhov jail  On 19 November  a few weeks after the proclamation of soviet power in Petrograd  they escaped from their confinement  eased by the fact that the jail was guarded by Kornilov s supporters  and made their way to the Don region  which was controlled by the Don Cossacks  Here they linked up with General Mikhail Alekseev  Kornilov became the military commander of the anti Bolshevik Volunteer Army with Alekseev as the political chief   Even before the Red Army was formed  Lavr Kornilov promised   the greater the terror  the greater our victories   He vowed that the goals of his forces must be fulfilled even if it was needed  to set fire to half the country and shed the blood of three quarters of all Russians   In the Don region village of Lezhanka alone  bands of Kornilov s officers killed more than 500 people   On 24 February 1918  as Rostov and the Don Cossack capital of Novocherkassk fell to the Bolsheviks  Kornilov led the Volunteer Army on the epic  Ice March  into the empty steppe towards the Kuban  Although badly outnumbered  he escaped destruction from pursuing Bolshevik forces and laid siege to Ekaterinodar  the capital of the Kuban Soviet Republic  on 10 April  However  in the early morning of 13 April  a Soviet shell landed on his farmhouse headquarters and killed him  He was buried in a nearby village   A few days later  when the Bolsheviks gained control of the village  they unearthed Kornilov s coffin  dragged his corpse to the main square and burnt his remains on the local rubbish dump   The Kornilov Division  one of the crack units of the White Army  was named after him  as well as many other autonomous White Army formations  such as the Kuban Cossack Kornilov Horse Regiment  The Kornilov Division became recognizable for its Totenkopf insignia  which appears on the division s flags  pennants  and soldiers  sleeve patches   4  Honours and awards  Order of St  Stanislaus  third
