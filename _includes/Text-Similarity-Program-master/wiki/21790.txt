   is the capital and the largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu in Japan  It became a center of Portuguese and other European influence in the 16th through 19th centuries  and the Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki have been proposed for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List  Part of Nagasaki was home to a major Imperial Japanese Navy base during the First Sino Japanese War and Russo Japanese War  Its name means  long cape    During World War II  the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and  to date  last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack   As of January 1  2009  the city has an estimated population of 446 007 and a population density of 1 100 persons per km²  The total area is 406 35 km²   1  History  1 1  Medieval and early modern eras  A small fishing village secluded by harbours  Nagasaki had little historical significance until contact with Portuguese explorers in 1543  An early visitor was Fernão Mendes Pinto  who came on a Portuguese ship which landed nearby in Tanegashima   Soon after Portuguese ships started sailing to Japan as regular trade freighters  thus increasing the contact and trade relations between Japan and the rest of the world  and particularly with mainland China  with whom Japan had previously severed its commercial and political ties  mainly due to a number of incidents involving Wokou piracy in the South China Sea  with the Portuguese now serving as intermediaries between the two Asian countries  Despite the mutual advantages derived from these trading contacts  which would soon be acknowledged by all parties involved  the lack of a proper seaport in Kyūshū for the purpose of harboring foreign ships posed a major problem for both merchants and the Kyushu daimyo  feudal lords  who expected to collect great advantages from these intercourse with the Portuguese   In the meantime  Navarrese Jesuit missionary St  Francis Xavier arrived in Kagoshima  South Kyūshū  in 1549  and soon initiated a thorough campaign of evangelization throughout Japan  but left for China in 1551 and died soon afterwards  His followers who remained behind converted a number of daimyo  The most notable among them was Ōmura Sumitada  who greatly profited from his conversion to the  Kirishitan  religion through an accompanying deal to receive a portion of the trade from Portuguese ships  In 1569  Ōmura granted a permit for the establishment of a port with the purpose of harboring Portuguese ships in Nagasaki  which was finally set in 1571  under the supervision of the Jesuit missionary Gaspar Vilela and Portuguese Captain Major Tristão Vaz de Veiga  with Ōmura s personal assistance   The little harbor village quickly grew into a diverse port city   and Portuguese products imported through Nagasaki  such as tobacco  bread  textiles and a Portuguese sponge cake called castellas  were assimilated into popular Japanese culture  Tempura derived from a popular Portuguese recipe originally known as peixinho da horta  and takes its name from the Portuguese word   tempero  another example of the enduring effects of this cultural exchange  The Portuguese also brought with them many goods from China   Due to the instability during the Sengoku period  Sumitada and Jesuit leader Alexandro Valignano conceived a plan to pass administrative control over to the Society of Jesus rather than see the Catholic city taken over by a non Catholic daimyo  Thus  for a brief period after 1580  the city of Nagasaki was a Jesuit colony  under their administrative and military control  It became a refuge for Christians escaping maltreatment in other regions of Japan  In 1587  however  Toyotomi Hideyoshi s campaign to unify the country arrived in Kyūshū  Concerned with the large Christian influence in southern Japan  as well as the active and what was perceived as the arrogant role the Jesuits were playing in the Japanese political arena  Hideyoshi ordered the expulsion of all missionaries  and placed the city under his direct control  However  the expulsion order went largely unenforced  and the fact remained that most of Nagasaki s population remained openly practicing Catholic   In 1596  the Spanish ship San Felipe was wrecked off the coast of Shikoku  and Hideyoshi learned from its pilot that the Spanish Franciscans were the vanguard of an Iberian invasion of Japan  In response  Hideyoshi ordered the crucifixions of twenty six Catholics in Nagasaki on February 5 of that year  i e  the  Twenty six Martyrs of Japan    Portuguese traders were not ostracized  however  and so the city continued to thrive  In 1602  Augustinian missionaries also arrived in Japan  and when Tokugawa Ieyasu took power in 1603  Catholicism was still tolerated  Many Catholic daimyo had been critical allies at the Battle of Sekigahara  and the Tokugawa position was not strong enough to move against them  Once Osaka Castle had been taken and Toyotomi Hideyoshi s offspring killed  though  the Tokugawa dominance was assured  In addition  the Dutch and English presence allowed trade without religious strings attached  Thus  in 1614  Catholicism was officially banned and all missionaries ordered to leave  Most Catholic daimyo apostatized  and forced their subjects to do so  although a few would not renounce the religion and left the country for Macau  Luzon and Japantowns in Southeast Asia  A brutal campaign of persecution followed  with thousands of converts across Kyūshū and other parts of Japan killed  tortured  or forced to renounce their religion   Catholicism s last gasp as an open religion  and the last major military action in Japan until the Meiji Restoration  was the Shimabara Rebellion of 1637  While there is no evidence that Europeans directly incited the rebellion  Shimabara Domain had been a Christian han for several decades  and the rebels adopted many Portuguese motifs and Christian icons  Consequently  in Tokugawa society the word  Shimabara  solidified the connection between Christianity and disloyalty  constantly used again and again in Tokugawa propaganda   The Shimabara Rebellion also convinced many policy makers that foreign influences were more trouble than they were worth  leading to the national isolation policy  The Portuguese  who had been previously living on a specially constructed island prison in Nagasaki harbour called Dejima  were expelled from the archipelago altogether  and the Dutch were moved from their base at Hirado into the trading island  In 1720 the ban on Dutch books was lifted  causing hundreds of scholars to flood into Nagasaki to study European science and art  Consequently  Nagasaki became a major center of rangaku  or  Dutch Learning   During the Edo period  the Tokugawa shogunate governed the city  appointing a hatamoto  the Nagasaki bugyō  as its chief administrator  Consensus among historians was once that Nagasaki was Japan s only window on the world during its time as a closed country in the Tokugawa era  However  nowadays it is generally accepted that this was not the case  since Japan interacted and traded with the Ryūkyū Kingdom  Korea and Russia through Satsuma  Tsushima and Matsumae respectively  Nevertheless  Nagasaki was depicted in contemporary art and literature as a cosmopolitan port brimming with exotic curiosities from the Western World   In 1808  during the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy frigate HMS Phaeton entered Nagasaki Harbor in search of Dutch trading ships  The local magistrate was unable to resist the British demand for food  fuel  and water  later committing seppuku as a result  Laws were passed in the wake of this incident strengthening coastal defenses  threatening death to intruding foreigners  and prompting the training of English and Russian translators   The Tōjinyashiki  唐人屋敷  or Chinese Factory in Nagasaki was also an important conduit for Chinese goods and information for the Japanese market  Various colourful Chinese merchants and artists sailed between the Chinese mainland and Nagasaki  Some actually combined the roles of merchant and artist such as 18th century Yi Hai  It is believed that as much as one third of the population of Nagasaki at this time may have been Chinese   1 2  Modern era  With the Meiji Restoration  Japan opened its doors once again to foreign trade and diplomatic relations  Nagasaki became a free port in 1859 and modernization began in earnest in 1868  Nagasaki was officially proclaimed a city on April 1  1889  With Christianity legalized and the Kakure Kirishitan coming out of hiding  Nagasaki regained its earlier role as a center for Roman Catholicism in Japan   During the Meiji period  Nagasaki became a center of heavy industry  Its main industry was ship building  with the dockyards under control of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries becoming one of the prime contractors for the Imperial Japanese Navy  and with Nagasaki harbor used as an anchorage under the control of nearby Sasebo Naval District  During World War II  at the time of the nuclear attack on August 9  1945  Nagasaki was an important industrial city  containing both plants of the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works  the Akunoura Engine Works  Mitsubishi Arms Plant  Mitsubishi Electric Shipyards  Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works  Mitsubishi Urakami Ordnance Works  several other small factories  and most of the ports storage and trans shipment facilities  which employed about 90% of the city s labor force  and accounted for 90% of the city s industry  These connections with the Japanese war effort made Nagasaki a major target for bombing by the Allies during the war   1 3  Atomic bombing of Nagasaki during World War II  For 12 months prior to the nuclear attack  Nagasaki had experienced five small scale air attacks by an aggregate of 136 planes which dropped a total of 270 tons of high explosive  53 tons of incendiary  and 20 tons of fragmentation bombs  Of these  a raid of August 1  1945  was most effective  with few of the bombs hitting the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city  several hitting the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works  and six bombs landing at the Nagasaki Medical School and Hospital  with three direct hits on buildings there  While the damage from these few bombs were relatively small  it created considerable concern in Nagasaki and a number of people  principally school children  were evacuated to rural areas for safety  thus reducing the population in the city at the time of the atomic attack   On the day of the nuclear strike on August 9  1945  the population in Nagasaki was estimated to be 263 000  which consisted of 240 000 Japanese residents  10 000 Korean residents  2 500 conscripted Korean workers  9 000 Japanese soldiers  600 conscripted Chinese workers  and 400 Allied POWs  That day  the Boeing B 29 Superfortress Bockscar  commanded by Major Charles Sweeney  departed from Tinian s North Field just before dawn  this time carrying a plutonium bomb codenamed ‘Fat Man’  The primary target for the bomb was Kokura  with the secondary target  Nagasaki  if the primary target was too cloudy to make a visual  When the plane reached Kokura at 9 44 a m   10 44 a m  Tinian Time   the city was obscured by clouds and smoke  as the nearby city of Yawata was firebombed the previous day  Unable to make a bombing attack on visual due to the clouds and smoke and with limited fuel  the plane left the city at 10 30 a m  for the secondary target  After 20 minutes  the plane arrived at 10 50 a m  over Nagasaki  but the city was also concealed by clouds  Desperately short of fuel and after making a couple of bombing runs without obtaining any visual target  the crew was forced to use radar in order to drop the bomb  At the last minute  the opening of the cloud allowed them to make visual contact with a racetrack in Nagasaki and dropped the bomb on the city s Urakami Valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi Urakami Ordnance Works in the north  After 53 seconds of its release  the bomb exploded at 11 02 a m  at an approximate altitude of 1 800 feet  This was the second and  to date  the last use of nuclear weaponry in combat and also the second detonation of a plutonium bomb  the first was tested in central New Mexico  USA   Within less than a second after the detonation  the north of the city was destroyed  Roughly 39 000–80 000 people were killed  about half of these died immediately while the other half suffered lingering deaths  Among the deaths were 6 200 out of the 7 500 employees of the Mitsubishi Munitions plant and thousands of others  including 2 000 Koreans  who worked in other war plants and factories in the city  as well as 150 Japanese soldiers  The industrial damage in Nagasaki was high  partly owing to the inadvertent targeting of the industrial zone  leaving 68 80 percent of the non dock industrial production destroyed  The bomb was somewhat more powerful than the  Little Boy  bomb dropped over Hiroshima  but because of Nagasaki s more uneven terrain  there was less damage   1 4  After the war  The city was rebuilt after the war  albeit dramatically changed  The pace of reconstruction was slow  The first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946  The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade  shipbuilding and fishing  This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949  New temples were built  as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity  Some of the rubble was left as a memorial  such as a one legged torii at Sannō Shrine and an arch near ground zero  New structures were also raised as memorials  such as the Atomic Bomb Museum  Nagasaki remains first and foremost a port city  supporting a rich ship building industry and setting a strong example of perseverance and peace   On January 4  2005  the towns of Iōjima  Kōyagi  Nomozaki  Sanwa  Sotome and Takashima  all from Nishisonogi District  were merged into Nagasaki   2  Geography and climate  Nagasaki and Nishisonogi Peninsulas are located within the city limits  The city is surrounded by the cities of Isahaya and Saikai  and the towns of Togitsu and Nagayo in Nishisonogi District   Nagasaki lies at the head of a long bay which forms the best natural harbor on the island of Kyūshū  The main commercial and residential area of the city lies on a small plain near the end of the bay  Two rivers divided by a mountain spur form the two main valleys in which the city lies  The heavily built up area of the city is confined by the terrain to less than    Nagasaki has the typical humid subtropical climate of Kyūshū and Honshū  characterized by mild winters and long  hot  and humid summers  Apart from Kanazawa and Shizuoka it is the wettest sizeable city in Japan and indeed all of temperate Eurasia  In the summer  the combination of persistent heat and high humidity results in unpleasant conditions  with wet bulb temperatures sometimes reaching   In the winter  however  Nagasaki is drier and sunnier than Gotō to the west  and temperatures are slightly milder than further inland in Kyūshū  Since records began in 1878 the wettest month has been July 1982 with including in a single day  whilst the driest month has been September 1967 with   Precipitation occurs year round  though winter is the driest season  rainfall peaks sharply in June & July  August is the warmest month of the year   3  Nagasaki in Western literature and music  David Mitchell s 2010 novel The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is set
