In Vedic religion  Varuna    Sanskrit    Malay  Baruna   is a god of the water and of the celestial ocean  as well as a god of law of the underwater world  A Makara is his mount  In Hindu mythology  Varuna continued to be considered the god of all forms of the water element  particularly the oceans   1  In the Vedas  As chief of the Adityas  Varuna has aspects of a solar deity though  when opposed to Mitra  Vedic term for Surya   he is rather associated with the night  and Mitra with the daylight  As the most prominent Deva  however  he is mostly concerned with moral and societal affairs than being a deification of nature  Together with Mitra–originally  agreement   between tribes  personified—being master of   he is the supreme keeper of order and god of the law  The word ṛtá  order  is also translated as  season    Varuna and Mitra are the gods of the societal affairs including the oath  and are often twinned Mitra Varuna  a dvandva compound   Varuna is also twinned with Indra in the Rigveda  as Indra Varuna  when both cooperate at New Year in re establishing order     The Rigveda and Atharvaveda portrays Varuna as omniscient  catching liars in his snares  The stars are his thousand eyed spies  watching every movement of men   In the Rigveda  Indra  chief of the Devas  is about six times more prominent than Varuna  who is mentioned 341 times  This may misrepresent the actual importance of Varuna in early Vedic society due to the focus of the Rigveda on fire and Soma ritual  Soma being closely associated with Indra  Varuna with his omniscience and omnipotence in the affairs of men has many aspects of a supreme deity  The daily Sandhyavandanam ritual of a dvija addresses Varuna in this aspect in its evening routine  asking him to forgive all sins  while Indra receives no mention   Both Mitra and Varuna are classified as Asuras in the Rigveda  e g  RV 5 63 3   although they are also addressed as Devas as well  e g  RV 7 60 12   possibly indicating the beginning of the negative connotations carried by Asura in later times   In post Vedic texts Varuna became the god of oceans and rivers and keeper of the souls of the drowned  As such  Varuna is also a god of the dead  and can grant immortality  He is attended by the nagas  He is also one of the Guardians of the directions  representing the west   Later art depicts Varuna as a lunar deity  as a yellow man wearing golden armor and holding a noose or lasso made from a snake  He rides the sea creature Makara   2  In the Ramayana  Faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to Lanka  where his abducted wife Sita is held captive by the demon king Ravana  Rama  an Avatar of Vishnu  performs a penance  tapasya  to Varuna  the Lord of Oceans  fasting and meditating in perfect dhyana for three days and three nights  Varuna does not respond  and Rama arises on the fourth morning  enraged by the God s arrogance  With his bow and arrow  he angrily begins attacking the oceans with celestial weapons—burning up the waters and killing its life and creatures  The Vanaras  Monkeys  are dazzled and fearful at witnessing the enraged Rama demolish the oceans  and his brother  Lakshmana  prays to calm Rama s mind  Just as Rama invokes the brahmastra  considered the most powerful weapon capable of destroying all creation  Varuna arises out of the oceans  He bows to Rama  explaining that he himself was at a loss to answer Rama s question  Begging him not to destroy the oceans with the missile  he suggests that Rama re direct the weapon at a demonic race that lives in the heart of the ocean  Rama s arrows destroys the demons  and establishes a purer  liberated environment there  Varuna promises that he would keep the oceans still for all of Rama s army to pass  and Nala constructs a bridge  Rama s Bridge  across to Lanka  Rama justifies his angry assault on the oceans as he followed the correct process of petitioning and worshipping Varuna  but obtaining the result by force for the greater good   3  In contemporary Hinduism  Worship of Varuna is an integral part of the evening ritual of the Sandhyavandanam  of a dvija Hindu  However  popular worship is primarily limited to Hindus of Sindhi origin   See Jhulelal   4  In Zoroastrianism   Varun  is one of 101 names of Ahura Mazda  meaning  Deliverer from evil    Varuna is not attested in the texts of the Avesta  The closest sea deity in Zoroastrian cosmology is Vourukasha  and the nearest homonym is Varena  the four cornered fourteenth region of the world  Vendidad 1 17  and populated by  fiends  and  savage  non Aryan natives   Vd 7 10   In Yasht 15  Haoshyangha begs for a boon that he might smite  two thirds of the daevas of Mazana and of the fiends of Varena    Yt 15 2 6  An individual who does not follow daena   the good  religion  is an anya varena   Yasna 16 2  Vd 12 21  15 2   Too late to be of relevance to a reconstruction of what might have happened to Indo Iranian *vouruna  if at all such a predecessor figure existed  in Iran is the  Varuna  of the circa 9th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition  the so called  Pahlavi  texts   and in the early New Persian Shahnameh  In both cases this Varuna is a dim witted  easily tricked demon of  backwards  ness  which is the literal Middle Persian meaning of his name   Assuming that Vedic Varuna is not a purely Indian development  i e  assuming that he derives from an Indo Iranian *vouruna   there are several different theories on what might have happened to Indo Iranian *vouruna in Iran   Nyberg  Die Religionen des alten Iran  1938 282ff  sees Varuna represented as the Amesha Spenta Asha Vahishta  Best Righteousness   an opinion—with extensions—that Dumezil  Tarpeia 1947 33 113  and Widengren  Die Religionen Irans  1965 12 13  also follow  This theory is based on Vedic Varuna s role as the principal protector of rta  which in Iran is represented by asha  vahishta    Kuiper  IIJ I  1957  proposes that none less than Ahura Mazda is a development from an earlier dvandva *vouruna mitra  The basis of Kuiper s proposal is that the equivalent of Avestan mazda  wisdom  is Vedic medhira  described in Rigveda 8 6 10 as the   revealed  insight into the cosmic order  that Varuna grants his devotees  In Kuiper s view  Ahura Mazda is then a compound divinity in which the propitious characteristics of *mitra negate the unfavorable qualities of *vouruna   Zimmer  Münchner Studien 1984 187 215  observed that Varuna has the byname  cult epithet  bhaga  an adjective that also appears in the Avesta  as baga   It may then be that the Avestan adjective is likewise a cult epithet  the proper name having been forgotten—a not uncommon occurrence  This may be seen to be reflected in Artaxerxes III s invocation of ahuramazda ura mithra baga  Ahura Mazda  Mithra  and the Baga   Boyce  Acta Iranica 21  1981 59 73    Another epithet of Vedic Varuna is asura  and there may be a remnant of Varuna in those Gathic passages  generally presumed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself  refers to the ahuras  plural  without  aside from Ahura Mazda  explicitly naming them  While Ahura Mazda is uniformly  the mightiest Ahura   e g  Yasna 33 11   in the only two occurrences of the term where the word does not refer to Ahura Mazda  the poet uses the expression mazdasca ahurano  Yasna 30 9  31 4   This phrase  generally understood to mean  the Wise  Mazda  One and the  other  Ahuras   is in  common opinion   so Boyce 1984 159  recognized as being archaic and in which the other Ahuras are *mitra and *varouna  Boyce  Mithra the King and Varuna the Master  2001  sees this supported by the younger Avestan dvandvah expression mithra ahura berezanta  Mithra and the High Lord   the latter being unambiguously Ahura Berezainti   High Lord  Apam Napat  the third member of the Ahuric triad  Gray  Foundations  1929 15   and with whose Indian equivalent  also Apam Napat  Vedic Varuna is closely associated   5  In modern age  Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Varuna for Varuna  the Vedic god of oceans and rivers and keeper of the souls of the drowned   The first Varuna was a screw gunboat launched in 1861 and sunk by enemy action in April 1862   The second Varuna  AGP 5  was a motorboat tender  commissioned in 1943 and decommissioned in 1946  INS Varuna is a sail training vessel of the Indian Navy  Varuna was completed in April 1981 by Alcock Ashdown in Bhavnagar  It can carry 26 cadets   The Varuna class of ship of Indian Navy are sail training vessels  They consist of the following three ships   INS Varuna  INS Tarangini  INS Sudarshini The dwarf planet candidate 20000 Varuna is named after Varuna   6  See also  Rigvedic deities  Mitra  Vedic   Adityas
