In chemistry and physics  a nucleon is one of the particles that makes up the atomic nucleus  Each atomic nucleus consists of one or more nucleons  and each atom in turn consists of a cluster of nucleons surrounded by one or more electrons  There are two known kinds of nucleon  the neutron and the proton  The mass number of a given atomic isotope is identical to its number of nucleons  Thus the term nucleon number may be used in place of the more common terms mass number or atomic mass number   Until the 1960s  nucleons were thought to be elementary particles  each of which would not then have been made up of smaller parts  Now they are known to be composite particles  made of three quarks bound together by the so called strong interaction  The interaction between two or more nucleons is called internucleon interactions or nuclear force  which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction   Before the discovery of quarks  the term  strong interaction  referred to just internucleon interactions    Nucleons sit at the boundary where particle physics and nuclear physics overlap  Particle physics  particularly quantum chromodynamics  provides the fundamental equations that explain the properties of quarks and of the strong interaction  These equations explain quantitatively how quarks can bind together into protons and neutrons  and all the other hadrons   However  when multiple nucleons are assembled into an atomic nucleus  nuclide   these fundamental equations become too difficult to solve directly  see lattice QCD   Instead  nuclides are studied within nuclear physics  which studies nucleons and their interactions by approximations and models  such as the nuclear shell model  These models can successfully explain nuclide properties  for example  whether or not a certain nuclide undergoes radioactive decay   The proton and neutron are both baryons and both fermions  They are quite similar  One carries a non zero net charge and the other carries a zero net charge  the proton s mass is only 0 1% less than the neutron s  Thus  they can be viewed as two states of the same nucleon  They together form the isospin doublet     In isospin space  neutrons can be rotationally transformed into protons  and vice versa  These nucleons are acted upon equally by the strong interaction  This implies that strong interaction is invariant when doing rotation transformation in isospin space  According to the Noether theorem  isospin is conserved with respect to the strong interaction   1  Overview  1 1  Properties  Protons and neutrons are most important and best known for constituting atomic nuclei  but they can also be found on their own  not part of a larger nucleus  A proton on its own is the nucleus of the hydrogen 1 atom  1H   A neutron on its own is unstable  see below   but they can be found in nuclear reactions  see neutron radiation  and are used in scientific analysis  see neutron scattering    Both the proton and neutron are made of three quarks  The proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark  while the neutron is one up quark and two down quarks  The quarks are held together by the strong force  It is also said that the quarks are held together by gluons  but this is just a different way to say the same thing  gluons mediate the strong force    An up quark has electric charge + e  and a down quark has charge − e  so the total electric charge of the proton and neutron are +e and 0  respectively  The word  neutron  comes from the fact that it is electrically  neutral    The mass of the proton and neutron is quite similar  The proton is or   while the neutron is or   The neutron is roughly 0 1% heavier  The similarity in mass can be explained roughly by the slight difference in mass of up quark and down quark composing the nucleons  However  detailed explanation remains an unsolved problem in particle physics   The spin of both protons and neutrons is   This means they are fermions not bosons  and therefore  like electrons  they are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle  This is a very important fact in nuclear physics  Protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus cannot all be in the same quantum state  but instead they spread out into nuclear shells analogous to electron shells in chemistry  Another reason that the spin of the proton and neutron is important is because it is the source of nuclear spin in larger nuclei  Nuclear spin is best known for its crucial role in the NMR MRI technique for chemistry and biochemistry analysis   The magnetic moment of a proton  denoted μp  is   while the magnetic moment of a neutron is μn     These parameters are also important in NMR MRI   1 2  Stability  A neutron by itself is an unstable particle  It undergoes decay  a type of radioactive decay  by turning into a proton  electron  and electron antineutrino  with a half life around ten minutes   See the Neutron article for further discussion of neutron decay   A proton by itself is thought to be stable  or at least its lifetime is too long to measure   This is an important issue in particle physics  see Proton decay    Inside a nucleus  on the other hand  both protons and neutrons can be stable or unstable  depending on the nuclide  Inside some nuclides  a neutron can turn into a proton  plus other particles  as described above  inside other nuclides the reverse can happen  where a proton turns into a neutron  plus other particles  through decay or electron capture  and inside still other nuclides  both protons and neutrons are stable and do not change form   1 3  Antinucleons  Both of the nucleons have corresponding antiparticles  The antiproton and the antineutron  These antimatter particles have the same mass and opposite charge as the proton and neutron respectively  and they interact in the same way   This is generally believed to be exactly true  due to CPT symmetry  If there is a difference  it is too small to measure in all experiments to date   In particular  antinucleons can bind into an  antinucleus   So far  scientists have created antideuterium and antihelium 3 nuclei   2  Tables of detailed properties  2 1  Nucleons  The masses of the proton and neutron are known with far greater precision in atomic mass units  u  than in MeV c2  due to the relatively poorly known value of the elementary charge  The conversion factor used is 1 u   MeV c2  The masses of their antiparticles are assumed to be identical  and no experiments have refuted this to date  Current experiments show any percent difference between the masses of the proton and antiproton must be less than and the difference between the neutron and antineutron masses is on the order of MeV c2   At least 1035 years  See proton decay   For free neutrons  in most common nuclei  neutrons are stable   2 2  Nucleon resonances  Nucleon resonances are excited states of nucleon particles  often corresponding to one of the quarks having a flipped spin state  or with different orbital angular momentum when the particle decays  Only resonances with a 3 or 4 star rating at the Particle Data Group  PDG  are included in this table  Due to their extraordinarily short lifetimes  many properties of these particles are still under investigation   The symbol format is given as N M  L2I2J  where M is the particle s approximate mass  L is the orbital angular momentum of the Nucleon meson pair produced when it decays  and I and J are the particle s isospin and total angular momentum respectively  Since nucleons are defined as having isospin  the first number will always be 1  and the second number will always be odd  When discussing nucleon resonances  sometimes the N is omitted and the order is reversed  giving L2I2J  M   For example  a proton can be symbolized as  N 939  S11  or  S11  939     The table below lists only the base resonance  each individual entry represents 4 baryons  2 nucleon resonances particles  as well as their 2 antiparticles  Each resonance exists in a form with a positive electric charge  Q   with a quark composition of like the proton  and a neutral form  with a quark composition of like the neutron  as well as the corresponding antiparticles with antiquark compositions of and respectively  Since they contain no strange  charm  bottom  or top quarks  these particles do not possess strangeness  etc  The table only lists the resonances with an isospin of   For resonances with isospin  see the Delta baryon article   † The P11 939  nucleon represents the excited state of a normal proton or neutron  for example  within the nucleus of an atom  Such particles are usually stable within the nucleus  i e  Lithium 6   3  Quark model classification  In the quark model with SU 2  flavour  the two nucleons are part of the ground state doublet  The proton has quark content of uud  and the neutron  udd  In SU 3  flavour  they are part of the ground state octet  8  of spin baryons  known as the Eightfold way  The other members of this octet are the hyperons strange isotriplet       the and the strange isodoublet     One can extend this multiplet in SU 4  flavour  with the inclusion of the charm quark  to the ground state 20 plet  or to SU 6  flavour  with the inclusion of the top and bottom quarks  to the ground state 56 plet   The article on isospin provides an explicit expression for the nucleon wave functions in terms of the quark flavour eigenstates   4  Models  Although it is known that the nucleon is made from three quarks    it is not known how to solve the equations of motion for quantum chromodynamics  Thus  the study of the low energy properties of the nucleon are performed by means of models  The only first principles approach available is to attempt to solve the equations of QCD numerically  using lattice QCD  This requires complicated algorithms and very powerful supercomputers  However  several analytic models also exist   The Skyrmion models the nucleon as a topological soliton in a non linear SU 2  pion field  The topological stability of the Skyrmion is interpreted as the conservation of baryon number  that is  the non decay of the nucleon  The local topological winding number density is identified with the local baryon number density of the nucleon  With the pion isospin vector field oriented in the shape of a hedgehog space  the model is readily solvable  and is thus sometimes called the hedgehog model  The hedgehog model is able to predict low energy parameters  such as the nucleon mass  radius and axial coupling constant  to approximately 30% of experimental values   The MIT bag model confines three non interacting quarks to a spherical cavity  with the boundary condition that the quark vector current vanish on the boundary  The non interacting treatment of the quarks is justified by appealing to the idea of asymptotic freedom  whereas the hard boundary condition is justified by quark confinement  Mathematically  the model vaguely resembles that of a radar cavity  with solutions to the Dirac equation standing in for solutions to the Maxwell equations and the vanishing vector current boundary condition standing for the conducting metal walls of the radar cavity  If the radius of the bag is set to the radius of the nucleon  the bag model predicts a nucleon mass that is within 30% of the actual mass  Although the basic bag model does not provide a pion mediated interaction  it describes excellently the nucleon nucleon forces through the 6 quark bag s channel mechanism using the P matrix   The chiral bag model merges the MIT bag model and the Skyrmion model  In this model  a hole is punched out of the middle of the Skyrmion  and replaced with a bag model  The boundary condition is provided by the requirement of continuity of the axial vector current across the bag boundary  Very curiously  the missing part of the topological winding number  the baryon number  of the hole punched into the Skyrmion is exactly made up by the non zero vacuum expectation value  or spectral asymmetry  of the quark fields inside the bag    this remarkable trade off between topology and the spectrum of an operator does not have any grounding or explanation in the mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces and their relationship to geometry  Several other properties of the chiral bag are notable  it provides a better fit to the low energy nucleon properties  to within 5–10%  and these are almost completely independent of the chiral bag radius  as long as the radius is less than the nucleon radius   This independence of radius is referred to as the Cheshire Cat principle  after the fading to a smile of Lewis Carroll s Cheshire Cat  It is expected that a first principles solution of the equations of QCD will demonstrate a similar duality of quark pion descriptions   5  See also  Hadrons  Electroweak interaction  6  Further reading  A W  Thomas and W Weise  The Structure of the Nucleon   2001
