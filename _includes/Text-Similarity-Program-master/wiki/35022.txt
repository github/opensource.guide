The 5 56×45mm NATO  official NATO nomenclature 5 56 NATO  is an intermediate cartridge developed in the United States and originally chambered in the M16 rifle  Under STANAG 4172  it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non NATO countries  It is derived from  but not identical to  the  223 Remington cartridge   1  History  In the 1950s  the 7 62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge  sold commercially as the  308 Winchester rifle cartridge  was selected to replace the  30 06 Springfield as the standard NATO rifle cartridge  At the time of selection  there had been criticism that the 7 62×51mm NATO was too powerful for light weight modern service rifles  causing excessive recoil  and that the ammunition did not allow for sufficient rate of fire in modern combat   The British had extensive evidence with their own experiments into an intermediate cartridge since 1945 and were on the point of introducing a  280 inch  7 mm  cartridge when the selection of the 7 62×51mm NATO was made  The FN company had also been involved  The concerns about recoil and effectiveness were effectively overruled by the US within NATO  and the other NATO nations accepted that standardization was more important at the time than selection of the ideal cartridge  However  while the 7 62×51mm NATO round became NATO standard the US was already engaged in research of their own  which ultimately led to the 5 56×45mm NATO cartridge   During the late 1950s  ArmaLite and other U S  firearm designers started their individual Small Caliber High Velocity  SCHV  assault rifle experiments using the commercial  222 Remington cartridge  When it became clear that there was not enough powder capacity to meet U S  Continental Army Command s  CONARC  velocity and penetration requirements  ArmaLite contacted Remington to create a similar cartridge with a longer case body and shorter neck  This became the  222 Remington Special  At the same time  Springfield Armory s Earle Harvey had Remington create an even longer cartridge case then known as the  224 Springfield  Springfield was forced to drop out of the CONARC competition  and thus the  224 Springfield was later released as a commercial sporting cartridge known as the  222 Remington Magnum  To prevent confusion with all of the competing  222 cartridge designations  the  222 Remington Special was renamed the  223 Remington  With the U S  military adoption of the ArmaLite M16 rifle in 1963  the  223 Remington was standardized as the 5 56×45mm NATO  As a commercial sporting cartridge the  223 Remington was only introduced in 1964   The 5 56×45mm cartridge  along with the M16 rifle  were initially adopted by U S  infantry forces as interim solutions to address the weight and control issues experienced with the 7 62×51mm round and M14 rifle  In the late 1950s  the Special Purpose Individual Weapon program sought to create flechette rounds to allow troops to fire sabot type projectiles to give a short flight time and flat trajectory with a muzzle velocity of to   At those speeds  factors like range  wind drift  and target movement would no longer affect performance  Several manufacturers produced varying weapons designs  including traditional wooden  bullpup   space age   and even multi barrel designs with drum magazines  All used similar ammunition firing a 1 8 mm diameter dart with a plastic  puller  sabot filling the case mouth  While the flechette ammo had excellent armor penetration  there were doubts about their terminal effectiveness against unprotected targets  Conventional cased ammunition was more accurate and the sabots were expensive to produce  The SPIW never created a weapons system that was combat effective  so the M16 was retained  and the 5 56 mm round was kept as the standard U S  infantry rifle cartridge   In a series of mock combat situations testing in the early 1960s with the M16  M14 and AK 47  the Army found that the M16 s small size and light weight allowed it to be brought to bear much more quickly  Their final conclusion was that an 8 man team equipped with the M16 would have the same fire power as a current 11 man team armed with the M14  U S  troops were able to carry more than twice as much 5 56×45mm NATO ammunition as 7 62×51mm NATO for the same weight  which would allow them a better advantage against a typical NVA unit armed with AK 47s    *AK 47 magazines are much heavier than M14 and M16 magazines   In 1977  NATO members signed an agreement to select a second  smaller caliber cartridge to replace the 7 62×51mm NATO cartridge  Of the cartridges tendered  the 5 56×45mm NATO was successful  but not the 55 gr M193 round used by the U S  at that time  The wounds produced by the M193 round were so devastating that many consider it to be inhumane  Instead  the Belgian 62 gr SS109 round was chosen for standardization  The SS109 used a heavier bullet with a steel tip and had a lower muzzle velocity for better long range performance  specifically to meet a requirement that the bullet be able to penetrate through one side of a steel helmet at 600 meters  This requirement made the SS109  M855  round less capable of fragmentation than the M193 and was considered more humane   The 5 56×45mm NATO inspired an international tendency towards relatively small sized  light weight  high velocity military service cartridges that produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse  favoring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy  Similar intermediate cartridges were developed and introduced by the Soviet Union in 1974  5 45×39mm  and by the People s Republic of China in 1987  5 8×42mm    2  Cartridge dimensions  The 5 56×45mm NATO has 1 85 ml  28 5 grains H2O  cartridge case capacity   5 56×45mm NATO maximum NATO cartridge dimensions  All sizes in millimeters  mm    Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha 2   23 degrees  The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 178 mm  1 in 7 in  or 229 mm  1 in 9 in   6 grooves  Ø lands   5 56 mm  Ø grooves   5 69 mm  land width   1 88 mm and the primer type is small rifle   According to the official NATO proofing guidelines the 5 56×45mm NATO case can handle up to piezo service pressure  In NATO regulated organizations every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum pressure to certify for service issue  This is equal to the C I P  maximum pressure guideline for the  223 Remington cartridge  which is the 5 56×45mm NATO parent cartridge   3  Performance  The 5 56×45mm NATO SS109 M855 cartridge  NATO  SS109  U S   M855  with standard 62 gr  lead core bullets with steel penetrator will penetrate approximately into soft tissue in ideal circumstances  As with all spitzer shaped projectiles it is prone to yaw in soft tissue  However  at impact velocities above roughly   it may yaw and then fragment at the cannelure  the crimping groove around the cylinder of the bullet   These fragments can disperse through flesh and bone  inflicting additional internal injuries   Fragmentation  if or when it occurs  imparts much greater damage to human tissue than bullet dimensions and velocities would suggest  This fragmentation effect is highly dependent on velocity  and therefore barrel length  short barreled carbines generate less muzzle velocity and therefore lose wounding effectiveness at much shorter ranges than longer barreled rifles  Proponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the rapid transfer of energy also results in wounding effects beyond the tissue directly crushed and torn by the bullet and fragments  These remote wounding effects are known as hydrostatic shock   SS109 M855 NATO ball can penetrate up to of steel at 600 meters  According to Nammo  a Norwegian ammunition producer  the 5 56×45mm NATO M995 armour piercing cartridge can penetrate up to of RHA steel at 100 meters   The US Army s Ballistic Research Laboratory measured a ballistic coefficient  G7 BC  of 0 151 and form factor  G7 i  of 1 172 for the SS109 M855 ball projectile   The Swedish military has measured the bullet velocities of SS109 M855 military cartridges at from the muzzle fired from differing barrel lengths   3 1  Criticism  There has been much debate of the allegedly poor performance of the bullet on target  especially the first shot kill rate when the muzzle velocity of the firearms used and the downrange bullet deceleration do not achieve the minimally required terminal velocity of over at the target to cause fragmentation  Many complaints were reported during the Gulf War  Somalia  and in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  This can be attributed to the change in barrel length  as this cartridge was designed to achieve maximum performance in a barrel  The barrel of the U S  military s M4 carbine generates considerably less muzzle velocity than the longer barrel found on the M16 rifle  and terminal performance can be a particular problem with the M4   The 5 56×45mm NATO standard SS109 M855 cartridge was designed for maximum performance when fired from a long barrel  as was the original 5 56 mm M193 cartridge  Experiments with longer length barrels up to resulted in no improvement or a decrease in muzzle velocities for the SS109 M855 cartridge  Shorter barrels produce a greater flash and noise signature  and the addition of a suppressor to a short barreled AR family rifle can make it unreliable  as the reduced time for the propellant to burn in the barrel and higher muzzle pressure levels at the suppressor entrance can cause faster cycling and feeding issues  Unless the gas port can be regulated or adjusted for higher pressures  suppressors for short barreled 5 56×45mm NATO firearms must be larger and heavier than models for standard length rifles to function reliably  SS109 M855 cartridges fired from barrels under about in length do not have enough muzzle velocity energy to cause bullet fragmentation that occurs only at terminal velocities of over on impact  reducing the wounding capacity   Despite complaints that the 5 56×45mm NATO round lacks stopping power  others contend that animal studies of the wounding effects of the 5 56×45mm NATO round versus the 7 62×39mm have found that the 5 56x45mm NATO round is more damaging  due to the post impact behavior of the 5 56 mm projectile resulting in greater cavitation of soft tissues  The US Army contended in 2003 that the lack of close range lethality of the 5 56×45mm NATO was more a matter of perception than fact  With controlled pairs and good shot placement to the head and chest  the target was usually defeated without issue  The majority of failures were the result of hitting the target in non vital areas such as extremities  However  a minority of failures occurred in spite of multiple hits to the chest   Some have contended that shot placement is the most important parameter in determining the lethality of a bullet  Shots to the central nervous system and major blood vessels are the primary forms of incapacitation  Difficulty with the 5 56×45mm NATO at range has been attributed to training  Underperformance is thus attributed to errors in range and wind estimation  target lead  firing position  and stress under fire  These factors can be resolved through training   Few nations teach shooting beyond 200–300 meters to regular soldiers  Sweden and Canada had requirements to shoot 3–5 rounds  respectively  in the prone or kneeling position at 100 meters with a max dispersion of   At a marksmanship training workshop held in Spain in March 2010  some participants went from using 150 rounds over 28 hours to engage targets out to 200 meters  to using 1 000 rounds over two weeks engaging targets out to 400 meters and may or may not have improved   Swedish ISAF units relied on  50 BMG heavy machine guns for long range shooting  Due to resilience to factors such as range and wind drift   The effect of barrel length can be quantified  A barrel length reduction of 59 percent results in a reduced muzzle velocity for 5 56x45mm NATO ball of 21 percent   The length differences between a M16 barrel and M4 barrel results in a trajectory difference of at 250 m  Time of flight difference from the two barrel lengths is marginal   per meter per second at 300 meters   A bullet fired from an M16 has a greater terminal velocity than one from an M4 equating to an approximately 50 meters more distant target   3 2  Improvements  Advances have been made in 5 56 mm ammunition  The U S  Military had adopted for limited issue a 77 grain  5 0 g   Match  bullet  type classified as the Mk 262  The heavy  lightly constructed bullet fragments more violently at short range and also has a longer fragmentation range  Originally designed for use in the Mk 12 SPR  the ammunition has found favor with special forces units who were seeking a more effective cartridge to fire from their M4A1 carbines  Commercially available loadings using these heavier  and longer  bullets can be prohibitively expensive and cost much more than military surplus ammunition  Additionally  these heavy for caliber loadings sacrifice some penetrative ability compared to the M855 round  which has a steel penetrator tip   Performance of 5 56×45 mm military ammunition can generally be categorized as almost entirely dependent upon velocity in order to wound effectively  Heavy OTM bullets enhance soft tissue wounding ability at the expense of hard target barrier penetration   U S  Special Forces had sought to create a round that had increased power out of carbine M4 barrels and compact SCAR L barrels  while increasing hard target performance  Developmental efforts led to the creation of the Mk318  The bullet uses an open tip design to inflict damage on soft tissue  and has a brass rear to penetrate hard targets  The tip and lead core fragments consistently even out of short barrels  while the rear moves through once the front impacts  It has more consistent performance because it is not yaw dependent like the M855  the nose fragments upon impact and solid rear penetrator continues to move relatively straight  This makes the Mk318 effective against personnel with or without body armor  The round also increases accuracy  from 3–5 minute of angle with the M855 from an M4A1 barrel to 1 71 MOA at 300 yards and 1 67 MOA at 600 yards from a SCAR L barrel   For general issue  the U S  Army adopted the M855A1 round in 2010 to replace the M855  The primary reason was pressure to use non lead bullets  The lead slug is replaced by a copper alloy slug in a reverse drawn jacket  with a hardened steel penetrator extending beyond the jacket  reducing lead contamination to the environment  The M855A1 offers several improvements other than being lead free  It is slightly more accurate  has better consistency of effect in regards to wounding ability  and has an increased penetrating capability  The round can better penetrate steel  brick  concrete  and masonry walls  as well as body armor and sheet metal  It penetrates of mild steel at 350 meters  which the M855 can only do at 160 meters  The propellant burns faster  which decreases the muzzle flash and gives a higher muzzle velocity  an important feature when fired from a short barreled M4 carbine  Though the M855A1 is more expensive to produce  its performance is considered to compensate  One possible danger is that it generates much greater pressure in the chamber when fired  decreasing service life of parts  and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure of the weapon  though this has yet to occur   The U S  Marines adopted the Mk318 in early 2010 due to delays with the M855A1  This was a temporary measure until the M855A1 was available for them  which occurred in mid 2010 when the Army began to receive the rounds  Both the Mk318 and M855A1 weigh the same and have similar performance  and both have better performance than the M855 against all targets  SOCOM spent less money developing the Mk318 and is marginally better than the M855A1 in some situations  but costs more per round  The Army spent more developing the M855A1 which performs as well or nearly as well as the Mk318  but is cheaper per round and has the advantage of being lead free  While SOCOM constantly looks for better equipment  the Army and Marines have far more troops to supply and buys more ammunition   3 3  Alternatives  If the 5 56 mm bullet is moving too slowly to reliably fragment on impact  the wound size and potential to incapacitate a person is greatly reduced  There have been numerous attempts to create an intermediate cartridge that addresses the complaints of 5 56 NATO s lack of stopping power along with lack of controllability seen in rifles firing 7 62 NATO in full auto  Some alternative cartridges like the 6 8mm Remington SPC  6 8×43mm  focused on superior short range performance by sacrificing long distance performance due to relatively short engagement distances typically observed in urban warfare  Others  like the 6 5mm Grendel  6 5×39mm   are attempts at engineering an all purpose cartridge that could replace both the 5 56 and 7 62 NATO rounds  The 300 AAC Blackout  7 62×35mm  round was designed to have the power of the 7 62×39mm for use in an M4 platform using standard M4 magazines  and to easily interchange between subsonic ammunition for suppressed firing and supersonic rounds  All these cartridges have certain advantages over the 5 56×45mm NATO  but they have their own individual tradeoffs to include lower muzzle velocity  less range  decreased magazine capacity  and different internal parts  None of these cartridges have gained any significant traction beyond sport shooting communities   By late 2004  the 6 8mm Remington SPC was in limited use with U S  Special Operators  However  it was not adopted for widespread use due to resistance from officials on changing calibers and the development of the 6 5mm Grendel  which had better accuracy past 500 meters  In 2007  both the U S  SOCOM and the U S  Marine Corps decided not to field weapons chambered in 6 8 mm due to logistical and cost issues   4  5 56 mm NATO versus  223 Remington  The 5 56 mm NATO and  223 Remington cartridges and chamberings are similar but not identical  While the cartridges are identical other than powder load  the chamber leade  i e  the area where the rifling begins  is cut to a sharper angle on some  223 commercial chambers  Because of this  a cartridge loaded to generate 5 56mm pressures in a 5 56mm chamber may develop pressures that exceed SAAMI limits when fired from a short leade  223 Remington chamber   4 1  Brass Case  The dimensional specifications of 5 56 NATO and  223 commercial brass cases are identical  The cases tend to have similar case capacity when measured  with variations chiefly due to brand  not 5 56 vs  223 designation  The result of this is that there is no such thing as  5 56 brass  or   223 brass   the differences in the cartridges lie in pressure ratings and in chamber leade length  not in the shape or thickness of the brass   In July 2012  the Army solicited a request for vendors to supply alternative cartridge cases to reduce the weight of an M855A1 5 56 mm round by at least 10 percent  as well as for the 7 62 NATO and  50 BMG rounds  The cartridge cases must maintain all performance requirements when fully assembled  be able to be used by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant  must be manufactured in quantities totaling approximately 45 million per year  Polymer cased ammunition is expected as a likely lightweight case technology  A hybrid polymer metal version of a conventional cartridge case would be thicker than regular cases and reduce the amount of space for the propellant  although certain polymers could be thermodynamically more efficient and not lose energy to the case or chamber when fired   4 2  Pressure  C I P  defines the maximum service and proof test pressures of the  223 Remington cartridge equal to the 5 56 mm NATO  at   This differs from the SAAMI maximum pressure specification for  223 Remington of   due to CIP test protocols measuring pressure using a drilled case  rather than an intact case with a conformal piston  along with other differences  NATO uses NATO EPVAT pressure test protocols for their small arms ammunition specifications   Because of these differences in methodology  the CIP pressure of is the same as a SAAMI pressure of   which is reflected in US Military specifications for 5 56 mm NATO  which call for a mean maximum pressure of 55 000 PSI  when measured using a protocol similar to SAAMI    These pressures are generated and measured using a chamber cut to 5 56  NATO specifications  including the longer leade  Firing 5 56mm NATO from a chamber with a shorter  223 Remington leade can generate pressures in excess of SAAMI maximums   4 3  Chamber  The 5 56 mm NATO chambering  known as a NATO or mil spec chamber  has a longer leade  which is the distance between the mouth of the cartridge and the point at which the rifling engages the bullet  The  223 Remington chambering  known as SAAMI chamber  is allowed to have a shorter leade  and is only required to be proof tested to the lower SAAMI chamber pressure  To address these issues  various proprietary chambers exist  such as the Wylde chamber  Rock River Arms  or the ArmaLite chamber  which are designed to handle both 5 56×45mm NATO and  223 Remington equally well  The dimensions and leade of the  223 Remington minimum C I P  chamber also differ from the 5 56 mm NATO chamber specification   Using commercial  223 Remington cartridges in a 5 56 mm NATO chambered rifle should work reliably  but until recently  it was believed this was less accurate than when fired from a  223 Remington chambered gun due to the longer leade  Although that may have been true in the early 1960s when the two rounds were developed  recent testing has shown that with today s ammunition  rifles chambered in 5 56mm can also fire  223 ammunition every bit as accurately as rifles chambered in  223 Remington  and the 5 56mm chamber has the additional advantage of being able to safely fire both calibers  Using 5 56 mm NATO mil spec cartridges  such as the M855  in a  223 Remington chambered rifle can lead to excessive wear and stress on the rifle and even be unsafe  and SAAMI recommends against the practice  Some commercial rifles marked as   223 Remington  are in fact suited for 5 56 mm NATO  such as many commercial AR 15 variants and the Ruger Mini 14  marked   223 cal   except the Mini 14  Target  model  which only fires  223   but the manufacturer should always be consulted to verify that this is acceptable before attempting it  and signs of excessive pressure  such as flattening or gas staining of the primers  should be looked for in the initial testing with 5 56 mm NATO ammunition   It should also be noted that the upper receiver  to which the barrel with its chamber are attached  and the lower receiver are entirely separate parts in AR 15 style rifles  If the lower receiver has either  223 or 5 56 stamped on it  it does not guarantee the upper assembly is rated for the same caliber  because the upper and the lower receiver in the same rifle can  and frequently do  come from different manufacturers – particularly with rifles sold to civilians or second hand rifles   In more practical terms  most AR 15 parts suppliers engineer their complete upper assemblies  not to be confused with stripped uppers where the barrel is not included  to support both calibers in order to satisfy market demand and prevent any potential problems   5  5 56 mm NATO versus 7 62 mm NATO  Benefits of the 5 56 NATO claimed over the 7 62 NATO include equal lethality  half the mass and volume  reduced recoil and signature  better penetration of metal plates  flatter trajectory and shorter time of flight out to 700 meters  weapons chambered for it are lighter  and better hit probability  Hit probability refers to the ability of a soldier to concentrate on firing in spite of their weapon s recoil and noise  which is noticeably different between the two cartridges  The 7 62 NATO has twice the impact energy of the 5 56 NATO which is needed if a target is protected by armor  but if not both rounds normally penetrate through enemies past 600 meters  A 5 56 NATO round fired from a barrel has a flatter trajectory than a 7 62 NATO round fired from a barrel of equal length  while the 5 56 NATO fired from a barrel has the same trajectory as the 7 62 NATO from a 20 in barrel  as well as the same time of flight  A 7 62 NATO round reaches 50 percent of its velocity within of the barrel when fired  so decreasing the barrel length for close quarters combat results in increased muzzle pressure and greater noise and muzzle flash   6  Military cartridge types  Cartridge  Ball  F1  Australia   5 56×45mm FN SS109 equivalent produced by Thales

prototypes  but the SS109 was found to be the best round and standardized on October 28  1980  The SS109 was developed in the 1970s for the FN FNC rifle and the FN Minimi machine gun  To increase the range of the Minimi  the round was created to penetrate 3 5 mm of steel at 600 meters  The SS109 had a steel tip and lead rear and was not required to penetrate body armor  Barrels required at least a 1 9 in rifle twist  but needed a 1 7 in rifle twist to fire tracer ammunition  The U S  designated the SS109 cartridge the M855 and first used it in the M16A2 rifle  The 62 grain round was heavier than the previous 55 grain M193  While the M855 had better armor penetrating ability  it is less likely to fragment after hitting a soft target  This lessens kinetic energy transfer to the target and reduces wounding capability  The M855 is yaw dependent  meaning it depends on the angle upon which it hits the target  If at a good angle  the round turns as it enters soft tissue  breaking apart and transferring its energy to what it hits  If impacting at a bad angle  it could pass through and fail to transfer its full energy  The SS109 was made to pierce steel helmets at long range from the Minimi  not improve terminal performance on soft tissue from rifles or carbines  In Iraq  troops that engaged insurgents at less than 150 yards found that M855 rounds did not provide enough stopping power  In addition to not causing lethal effects with two or more rounds  they did not effectively penetrate vehicle windshields  even with many rounds fired at extremely close range  In Afghanistan  troops found that M855 rounds also suffered at long ranges  Although 5 56 mm rifles have an effective range of 450–600 meters  the M855 bullet s performance falls off sharply beyond 300 meters  The ranges are even shorter for short barreled carbines  Half of small arms attacks were launched from 300–900 meter ranges  An M855 fired from an M4 Carbine has severely degraded performance beyond 150 meters   The maximum effective point target range of an M4 carbine with M855 rounds is 500 meters  with a maximum effective area target range of 600 meters  These mark the greatest distances the rounds can be expected to accurately hit the target  not the ranges that they have terminal effectiveness against them  Because the M855 is yaw dependent it requires instability in flight to deform upon hitting the target  It is the most stable in flight between 150–350 meters  potentially lessening its effectiveness if it strikes an enemy between those distances  In addition to this  tests have shown that 5 56 mm bullets fragment most reliably when traveling faster than   From full length 20 in rifle and machine gun barrels  rounds are kept above this velocity out to 200 meters  An M855 from an M4 has a muzzle velocity of   but that is reduced to by 150 meters  Even if it impacts at optimum speeds  70 percent of 5 56 mm bullets will not begin to yaw until of tissue penetration  15 percent more begin to yaw after that distance  so up to 85 percent of rounds that hit do not start to fragment until nearly 5 in of penetration  Against small statured or thin combatants  the M855 has little chance of yawing before passing through cleanly and leaving a wound cavity no bigger than the bullet itself  The factors of impact angle and velocity  instability distance  and penetration before yaw reduce the round s predictable effectiveness considerably in combat situations   6 2  M855A1  6 2 1  Development  In mid 2005  a meeting was held at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant as part of Phase II of the U S  Army s Green Ammunition replacement program and attended by representatives from several military sectors and contractors  The objective was to create an environmentally friendly small arms training round after the Army had been required  in part by stronger state regulations  to remove lead from their bullets to reduce lead accumulation at stateside training ranges  Initially  Phase I efforts created the M855  green tip  5 56 mm round that replaced the lead core with one made of tungsten  but it was found that the round would become unstable in flight and fly sideways through a target  furthermore  research was suggesting that tungsten was not environmentally better than lead  Phase II efforts focused on creating an alternative round that did not contain either metal  As the Iraq War was happening at the same time  participants decided to use the opportunity to redirect their efforts from just making a  green  training round to creating an entirely new general purpose rifle round to address complaints encountered in the field   Complaints had surfaced about the poor lethality of standard M855 rounds against soft targets  although while some units claimed they had virtually no effect others said they were having no problems  The problem was  yaw sensitivity   where rounds experiencing swing in flight have varying effects when they hit a target based on the degree of yaw  resulting in unpredictable lethality effects  The makeup and design of the bullet affected accuracy  the copper jacket is formed first at the point  then a steel penetrator is inserted into the jacket and the projectile is crimped shut  Error in the penetrator placement can change flight performance and affect dispersion  and the rearward drawn jacket can create and uneven boat tail leading to uneven airflow and more affected dispersion  It also was not optimized for use in short barreled rifles  The M855 was originally made to burn and accelerate from the barrel of the M249 SAW  then repurposed to the M16A2 for ammunition commonality  When fired from a short barreled M4  lower muzzle velocity led to decreased terminal effectiveness  and unburned propellant fired from the end of the barrel created a louder muzzle flash and caused more combustion debris to be pushed back in the gas tube  dirtying the weapon   Alternative 5 56 mm rounds in use were considered  like the Mk 262 open tipped match cartridge  The Mk 262 was more accurate and had better soft target performance  and both Army and Marine units were using large quantities in Iraq deployments for designated marksman rifles  However  the Mk 262 was not adequate as a general purpose round and cost four times more than the M855  so it could not be produced at the volumes required for 5 56 mm ammunition  up to 1 billion rounds annually   It was also found that performance suffered when fired from standard barrels  so match grade barrels would be needed for optimum performance  The M995 armor piercing round had high accuracy and target penetration  but was eight times more expensive than the M855  Commercial alternatives were found to have the same yaw sensitivity issues as the M855   A number of objectives were desired for the new round  including more lethal  or at least more consistent  soft target effects and less shot dispersion  It must not be specialized for any one task to have general purpose performance  and if improvement in any one area resulted that would be considered a secondary benefit  As the services were purchasing large numbers of optics  it could not require a different reticle pattern  but re zeroing sights would be acceptable  Optimization for short barreled rifles was needed  as the Army and Special Forces  main weapon was the M4 carbine  a flash suppressed propellant was also required  Optimizing the round to perform within the pressure limits for short barrels would cause performance loss in longer barrels  causing complaints from the Marine Corps   but analysis showed that a short barrel optimized round would have less performance loss fired from a long barrel than vice versa  The round also had to be cost competitive and meet environmental standards   The initial M855A1 design began testing in late 2007  Its alloy core had no toxic metals and could be cheaply produced  Materials and production methods  like a reverse drawn jacket for a clean boat tail  led to yaw insensitivity  improved soft target performance  and consistent dispersion  The steel penetrator was retained and  through greater velocity and better composition and placement  substantially improved hard target performance  It met short barrel optimization  ballistic similarity  and producibility requirements  it cost slightly more than the M855  but far less than the Mk 262  Production prove out testing would take time  as over a million rounds had to be test fired to ensure instances of failure would not occur at the 1 billion rounds per year scale  As information began to be made public  the original program objective to create a  green round  led to confusion and criticism that the Army was focusing more on environmental safety than on performance  Just as testing was being completed and the first production lots were being prepared in 2009  the rounds were found to fail at high temperatures  This caused a one year delay to replace the bullet core  which solved the temperature problem and also improved cost and producibility   6 2 2  Deployment  On June 24  2010  the United States Army announced it began shipping its new 5 56 mm cartridge  the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round  to active combat zones  During testing  the M855A1 performed better than M80 7 62×51mm NATO ball ammunition against certain types of targets  particularly hardened steel   blurring the performance differences that previously separated the two cartridges  The US Army Picatinny Arsenal stated that the new M855A1 offers improved hard target capability  more consistent performance at all distances  enhanced dependability  improved accuracy  reduced muzzle flash  and higher velocity compared to the M855 round  Further  the Army stated the new M855A1 ammunition is tailored for use in M4 carbines  but should also give enhanced performance in M16 rifles and M249 light machine guns  The new 62 grain  4 g  projectile or bullet used in the M855A1 round has a copper core with a 19 grain  1 2 g  steel  stacked cone  penetrating tip  The M855A1 cartridge is sometimes referred to as  green ammo  because it fires a lead free projectile  It is not necessarily more lethal than the M855  but performs more consistently every time it hits a soft target and retains its performance at longer distances  The EPR can penetrate a thick steel barrier from an M4 at 350 meters and from an M16 at 400 meters  Ballistics for both rounds are similar and don t require weapons to be re zeroed  but if they are the EPR can be slightly more accurate  The steel tip penetrator of the M855A1 is noticeably separated from the jacket of the bullet and can spin  but this is part of the design and does not affect performance  The M855A1 costs only 5 cents more per round than the M855  The M855A1 bullet has a greater length than the M855  Because steel and copper are less dense than lead  the bullet is lengthened inside the case to achieve the same weight as its predecessor  The longer bullet and reverse drawn jacket make it more stable and accurate in flight  Its steel tip is exposed from the jacket and bronzed for corrosion resistance  The tip is serrated and larger than the M855 s steel tip  The M855A1 s bullet composition  better aerodynamics  and higher proof pressures give it an extended effective range for penetration and terminal performance  While effectiveness at different ranges is increased  the M855A1 does not increase the effective ranges at which weapons are expected to hit their targets  The Enhanced Performance Round was made to nearly match the trajectory of the M855 to aid in training consistency  but the ranges to get desired effects are greatly extended   The M855A1 was put on hold in August 2009 due to the experimental bismuth tin alloy core exhibiting undependable ballistics at high temperatures  The US Army has since replaced the bismuth tin alloy core with one of solid copper eliminating the heat issue  The United States Marine Corps purchased 1 8 million rounds in 2010  with plans to adopt the round to replace the interim MK318 SOST rounds used in Afghanistan when the M855A1 project was delayed   On a media day at Aberdeen Proving Ground on May 4  2011  reports were given about the M855A1 s performance in the field since it was issued 11 months earlier  One primary advantage given by the round is its consistent performance against soft targets  While the older M855 was yaw dependant  which means its effectiveness depends on its yaw angle when it hits a target  the M855A1 delivers the same effectiveness in a soft target no matter its yaw angle  The new SMP 842 propellant in the round burns quicker in the shorter M4 carbine barrel  ensuring less muzzle flash and greater muzzle velocity  The M855A1 was able to penetrate of steel plate at 300 meters  The round even penetrated concrete masonry units  similar to cinder blocks  at 75 meters from an M16 and at 50 meters from an M4  which the M855 could not do at those ranges  Its accuracy is maintained and sometimes increased  as it was able to shoot a 2 inch group at 600 meters  February 2011 was the first time the M855A1 was used more than the M855  and approximately 30 million M855A1 rounds have been fielded from June 2010 to May 2011   The M855A1 was put to the test at the 2012 National Rifle Association s National High Power Rifle Championship at Camp Perry  Ohio in August 2012  The shooter for the Army was Rob Harbison  a contractor supporting small caliber ammunition capability development at Fort Benning Georgia  This was a special event for the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems and the Army s Maneuver Center of Excellence as it was an opportunity to showcase the capabilities of the Enhanced Performance Round  With an M16 loaded with M855A1 ammo  Harbison fired a perfect 200 points in the Coast Guard Trophy Match  which is 20 shots fired from the sitting position at 200 yards  finishing 17th out of 365 competitors  He also scored a perfect 100 on the final string of ten shots during the Air Force Cup Trophy Match  fired at 600 yards from the prone position  which is 10 shots in a row within the 12 inch  10 point ring at 600 yards with combat ammunition  Harbison was happy with the performance of the EPR  with his scores showing that the Army s newest general purpose round is accurate enough to go toe to toe in the competition with the best ammo that can be bought or hand loaded  Harbison even said   I don t think I could have scored any higher if I was using match grade competition ammunition    From fielding in June 2010 to September 2012  Alliant Techsystems delivered over 350 million M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds   Since its introduction  the M855A1 has been criticized for its propellant causing increased fouling of the gun barrel  Post combat surveys have reported no issues with the EPR in combat  A series of tests found no significant difference in fouling between the old M855 and the M855A1  However  manufacturers have reported  severe degradation  to barrels of their rifles using the M855A1 in tests  The Army attributes pressure and wear issues with the M855A1 to problems with the primer  which they claim to have addressed with a newly designed primer  It uses a modified four pronged primer anvil for more reliable powder ignition  The round does increase the chamber pressure from to    From June 2010 to June 2013  issuing of the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round removed 1 994 metric tons of lead from the waste stream  of lead are eliminated from each M855A1 projectile   6 3  Mk 262  The Mk 262 is a match quality round manufactured by Black Hills Ammunition made originally for the Special Purpose Rifle  SPR   It uses a Sierra MatchKing bullet that is more effective at longer ranges than the standard issue M855 round   In 1999  SOCOM requested Black Hills Ammunition to develop ammunition for the Mk 12 SPR that SOCOM was designing  For the rifle to be accurate out to 600 yards  Black Hills  militarized  a cartridge that used the Sierra 77 grain OTM projectile  it switched from a  223 Remington to 5 56 mm case  increased pressure loading  crimped and sealed the primer  and added a flash retardant to the powder  The Mk 262 Mod 0 was adopted in 2002  Issues came up in development including reliability problems in different temperatures and when the weapon got dirty  and cycling issues in cold weather due to the slightly shorter barrel of the SPR compared to the full length M16A2 barrel  The problems were addressed with a slower burning powder with a different pressure for use in the barrel  creating the Mk 262 Mod 1 in 2003  During the product improvement stage  the new propellant was found to be more sensitive to heat in weapon chambers during rapid firings  resulting in increased pressures and failure to extract  This was addressed with another powder blend with higher heat tolerance and improved brass  Also during the stage  Black Hills wanted the bullet to be given a cannelure  which had been previously rejected for fear it would affect accuracy  It was eventually added for effective crimping to ensure that the projectile would not move back into the case and cause a malfunction during auto load feeding  Although the temperature sensitive powder and new bullet changed specifications  the designation remained as the Mod 1   According to US DoD sources  the Mk 262 round is capable of making kills at 700 meters  Ballistics tests found that the round caused  consistent initial yaw in soft tissue  between 3 4 in at ranges from 15 feet to 300 meters  Apparently it is superior to the standard M855 round when fired from an M4 or M16 rifle  increasing accuracy from 3 5 minute of angle to 2 minute of angle  It evidently possesses superior stopping power  and can allow for engagements to be extended to up to 700 meters when fired from an 18 inch barrel  It appears that this round can drastically improve the performance of any AR 15 platform weapon chambered to  223 5 56 mm  Superior accuracy  wounding capacity  stopping power and range power has made this the preferred round of many Special Forces operators  and highly desirable as a replacement for the older  Belgian designed 5 56×45mm M855 NATO round  In one engagement  a two man special forces team reported 75 kills with 77 rounds  The Mk 262 has a higher ballistic coefficient than the M855 of  G7  0 190  meaning it loses less velocity at long range  Hard target penetration is slightly decreased   6 4  Mk318 Mod 0  Following early engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq  U S  Special Operations Forces reported that M855 ammunition used in M4A1 rifles was ineffective  In 2005  the Pentagon issued a formal request to the ammunition industry for “enhanced” ammunition  The only business that responded was the Federal Cartridge Company  owned by Alliant Techsystems  Working with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division  the team created performance objectives for the new ammo  increased consistency from shot to shot regardless of temperature changes  accuracy out of an M4A1 better than 2 minute of angle  2 inches at 100 yards  3 9 inches at 300 yards   increased stopping power after passing through “intermediate barriers” like walls and car windshields  increased performance and decreased muzzle flash out of shorter barrel FN SCAR rifles  and costs close to the M855  The first prototypes were delivered to the government in August 2007  Increased velocity and decreased muzzle flash were accomplished by the type of powder used  The design of the bullet was called the Open Tip Match Rear Penetrator  OTMRP   The front of it is an open tip backed up by a lead core  while the rear half is solid brass  When the bullet hits a hard barrier  the front half of the bullet smooshes against the barrier  breaking it so the penetrating half of the bullet can go through and hit the target  With the lead section penetrating the target and the brass section following  it was referred to as a  barrier blind  bullet   Officially designated the Mk318 Mod 0  Cartridge  Caliber 5 56mm Ball  Carbine  Barrier   and called SOST  Special Operations Science and Technology  ammunition  the 62 grain bullet fragments consistently  even out of a 10 5 in barrel  The lead portion fragments in the first few inches of soft tissue  then the solid copper rear penetrates 18 in of tissue  shown though ballistic gelatin  while tumbling  Out of a 14 in barrel  the Mk318 has a muzzle velocity of 2 925 fps   In February 2010  the U S  Marine Corps adopted the Mk318 for use by infantry  To be fielded by an entire branch of the military  the round is classified as having an  open tip  bullet  similar to the M118LR 7 62 NATO round  The SOST bullet uses a “reverse drawn” forming process  The base of the bullet is made first  the lead core is placed on top of it  and then the jacketing is pulled up around the lead core from bottom to tip  Conventional  and cheaper  bullets are made with the method of the jacket drawn from the nose to an exposed lead base  The reverse drawn technique leaves an open tip as a byproduct of the manufacturing process  and is not specifically designed for expansion or to affect terminal ballistics  The Pentagon legally cleared the rounds for Marine use in late January  The Marines fielded the Mk318 gradually and in small numbers  Initial studies showed that insurgents hit by it suffered larger exit wounds  although information was limited  SOST rounds were used alongside M855 rounds in situations where the SOST would be more effective  In July 2010  the Marines purchased 1 8 million M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds in  addition to millions of Mk318 rounds in service  as part of its effort to replace its M855 ammo   6 5  5 6mm Gw Pat 90  The 5 6mm Gw Pat 90 or GP 90  5 6 mm Rifle Cartridge 90   is the standard round used by the Swiss military in its rifle  the SIG SG 550  The cartridge is also known as the Cart 5 6mm 90 F to the French and Italian speaking Swiss militiamen  The Swiss refer to the round as the 5 6 mm Gw Pat 90  although it is interchangeable with the 5 56×45mm NATO and  223 Remington round  The Gw Pat 90 is optimized for use in 5 56 mm   223 in  caliber barrels with a 254 mm  1 10 in  twist rate   The Gw Pat 90 was designed for the SIG SG 550 when it came into production in 1987  replacing the SIG SG 510  Previous experience of a change in standard rifle had proved that changing the distance of fire for the training ranges was more expensive than the design of a new ammunition  this prompted the design of a cartridge nominally capable at 300 meters  The cartridge was also designed to reduce pollution by controlling lead emissions  The bullet was originally clad with a nickel alloy jacket  however  this was found to cause excessive barrel wear  so in 1998 the nickel jackets were replaced with tombac jackets  In addition  in 1999 a copper plug was added to the base of the bullet to address environmental concerns   The ammunition is currently  2009  produced by RUAG Ammotec  a subsidiary of the RUAG group  The ammunition is manufactured in three variations  the standard FMJ round  the tracer round  and a blank round   The FMJ cartridge has a Copper Zinc alloy case and uses a double base propellant  The bullet is a 4 1 g  63 gr  tombac jacketed FMJ projectile with a G1 ballistic coefficient of 0 331  ICAO    0 337  Army Metro   The projectile contains approximately 95% Pb  2% Sb  3% Cu  and was designed for terminal ballistic instability  The required accuracy for Gw Pat 90 ammunition out of factory test barrels is 63 mm  0 72 MOA  for 10 rounds  100% radius measurement method  out to 300 m  The Gw Pat 90 cartridge dimensions are in accordance with the civilian C I P  standards for the  223 Remington C I P  chambering   The Gw Pat 90 is used both in the Swiss military and in sport shooting  The very high level of individual training in the Swiss militia  every single soldier bearing a weapon has to shoot for qualification once a year  see Gun politics in Switzerland  and the overall use of the Gw Pat 90 by the many Swiss citizens who shoot in competitions and for amusement has resulted in significant input on its usage  Over 1 billion cartridges have been produced    7  Use  8  See also  5 45×39mm  5 8×42mm  7 62×39mm  Express  weaponry   NATO EPVAT testing  Table of handgun and rifle cartridges  List of rifle cartridges  9
