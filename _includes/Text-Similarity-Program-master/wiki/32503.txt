Villa Savoye    is a modernist villa in Poissy  in the outskirts of Paris  France  It was designed by Swiss architects Le Corbusier and his cousin  Pierre Jeanneret  and built between 1928 and 1931 using reinforced concrete   A manifesto of Le Corbusier s  five points  of new architecture  the villa is representative of the bases of modern architecture  and is one of the most easily recognizable and renowned examples of the International style   The house was originally built as a country retreat on behest of the Savoye family  After being purchased by the neighbouring school it passed on to be property of the French state in 1958  and after surviving several plans of demolition  it was designated as an official French historical monument in 1965  a rare occurrence  as Le Corbusier was still living at the time   It was thoroughly renovated from 1985 to 1997  and under the care of the Centre des monuments nationaux  the refurbished house is now open to visitors year round   1  Background  By the end of the 1920s Corbusier was already an internationally known architect  His book Vers une Architecture had been translated into several languages  his work with the Centrosoyuz in Moscow involved him with the Russian avant garde and his problems with the League of Nations competition had been widely publicised  Also he was one of the first members of Congrès International d Architecture Moderne  CIAM  and was becoming known as a champion of modern architecture   The villas designed by Corbusier in the early part of the 1920s demonstrated what he termed the  precision  of architecture  where each feature of the design needed to be justified in design and urban terms  His work in the later part of the decade  including his designs urban for Algiers began to be more free form     2  History of the commission  Pierre and Emilie Savoye approached Corbusier about building a country home in Poissy in the spring of 1928  The site was on a green field on an otherwise wooded plot of land with a magnificent landscape view to the north west that corresponded with the approach to the site along the road  Other than an initial brief prepared by Emile for a summer house  space for cars  an extra bedroom and a caretaker s lodge  Corbusier had such freedom with the job that he was only limited by his own architectural palette  He began work on the project in September 1928  His initial ideas were those that eventually manifested themselves in the final building but between Autumn 1928 and Spring 1929 he undertook a series of alternatives that were influenced primarily by the Savoye s concern about cost  The eventual solution to this problem was to reduce the volume of the building by moving the master bedroom down to the first floor and reducing the grid spacing down from 5 metres to 4 75 metres   3  Construction  Estimates of the cost in February 1929 were approximately half a million Francs  although this excluded the cost of the lodge and the landscaping elements  almost twice the original budget   The project was tendered in February with contracts awarded in March 1929  Changes made to the design whilst the project was being built including an amendment to the storey height and the exclusion and then re introduction of the chauffeur s accommodation led to the costs rising to approximately 800 000 Francs  At the time the project started on site no design work had been done on the lodge and the final design was only presented to the client in June 1929  The design was for a double lodge but this was reduced to a single lodge as the costs were too high  Although construction of the whole house was complete within a year it was not habitable until 1931   4  Design  The Villa Savoye is probably Corbusier s best known building from the 1930s  it had enormous influence on international modernism  It was designed addressing his emblematic  Five Points   the basic tenets in his new architectural aesthetic   Support of ground level pilotis  elevating the building from the earth and allowed an extended continuity of the garden beneath   Functional roof  serving as a garden and terrace  reclaiming for nature the land occupied by the building   Free floor plan  relieved of load bearing walls  allowing walls to be placed freely and only where aesthetically needed   Long horizontal windows  providing illumination and ventilation   Freely designed facades  serving only as a skin of the wall and windows and unconstrained by load bearing considerations  Unlike his earlier town villas Corbusier was able to carefully design all four sides of the Villa Savoye in response to the view and the orientation of the sun  On the ground floor he placed the main entrance hall  ramp and stairs  garage  chauffeur and maid s rooms  At first floor the master bedroom  the son s bedroom  guest bedroom  kitchen  salon and external terraces  The salon was oriented to the south east whilst the terrace faced the east  The son s bedroom faced the north west and the kitchen and service terrace were on the south west  At second floor level were a series of sculpted spaces that formed a solarium   The plan was set out using the principal ratios of the Golden section  in this case a square divided into sixteen equal parts  extended on two sides to incorporate the projecting façades and then further divided to give the position of the ramp and the entrance   In his book Vers une Architecture Corbusier exclaimed  the motor car is an object with a simple function  to travel  and complicated aims  comfort  resistance  appearance       The house  designed as a second residence and sited as it was outside Paris was designed with the car in mind  The sense of mobility that the car gave translated into a feeling of movement that is integral to the understanding of the building  The approach to the house was by car  past the caretaker s lodge and eventually under the building itself  Even the curved arc of the industrial glazing to the ground floor entrance was determined by the turning circle of a car  Dropped off by the chauffeur  the car proceeded around the curve to park in the garage  Meanwhile the occupants entered the house on axis into the main hall through a portico of flanking columns   The four columns in the entrance hall seemingly direct the visitor up the ramp  This ramp  that can be seen from almost everywhere in the house continues up to the first floor living area and salon before continuing externally from the first floor roof terrace up to the second floor solarium  Throughout his career Corbusier was interested in bringing a feeling of sacredness into the act of dwelling and acts such as washing and eating were given significance by their positioning  At the Villa Savoye the act of cleansing is represented both by the sink in the entrance hall and the celebration of the health giving properties of the sun in the solarium on the roof which is given significance by being the culmination of ascending the ramp   Corbusier s piloti perform a number of functions around the house  both inside and out  On the two longer elevations they are flush with the face of the façade and imply heaviness and support  but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house  The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above  Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they actually are   The Villa Savoye uses the horizontal ribbon windows found in his earlier villas  Unlike his contemporaries  Corbusier often chose to use timber windows rather than metal ones  It has been suggested that this is because he was interested in glass for its planar properties and that the set back position of the glass in the timber frame allowed the façade to be seen as a series of parallel planes   5  Later history  Problems with the Savoyes caused by all the requests for additional payment from the contractors for all the changes were compounded by the requirement for early repairs to the new house  Each autumn the Savoyes suffered problems with rainwater leaks through the roof  The Savoyes continued to live in the house until 1940  leaving during World War II  It was occupied twice during the war  first by the Germans   when it was used as a hay store   and then by the Americans  with both occupations damaging the building severely  The Savoyes returned to their estate after the war  but  no longer in position to live as they had done before the war  they abandoned the house again shortly after  The villa was expropriated by of the town of Poissy in 1958  which first used it as a public youth center and later considered demolishing it to make way for a schoolhouse complex  Protest from architects who felt the house should be saved  and the intervention of Corbusier himself  spared the house from demolition  A first attempt of renovation was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson  despite opposition from Corbusier  The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965  becoming the first modernist building designated as historical monument in France  and also the first to be the object of renovation while its architect was still living  In 1985  a thorough state funded restoration process  led by architect Jean Louis Véret  was undertaken  being completed in 1997  The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the facades and terraces because of deterioration of the concrete  the installation of lighting and security cameras  and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings   6  Legacy  The Villa Savoye was a very influential building of the 1930s and imitations of it can be found all over the world  The building featured in two hugely influential books of the time  Hitchcock and Johnson s The International Style published in 1932 and F  R  S  Yorke s The Modern House published in 1934  as well as the second volume of Corbusier s own series The Complete Works  In his 1947 essay The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa  Colin Rowe compared the Villa Savoye to Palladio s Villa Rotunda   The freedom given to Corbusier by the Savoyes resulted in a house that was governed more by his five principles than any requirements of the occupants  Despite this  it was the last time this happened in such a complete way and the house marked the end of a phase in his design thinking as well as being the last of a series of buildings dominated by the colour white   Criticism has been levelled at Corbusier s five points of architecture from a general point of view and these apply specifically to the Villa Savoye in terms of   Support of ground level pilotis   the piloti tended to be symbolic rather than representative of actual structure   Functional roof   poor detailing in this case led to the roof leaking  After the Villa Savoye Corbusier s experimentation with Surrealism informed his design for the Beistegui apartments  but his next villa design  for Mademoiselle Mandrot near Toulon had a regionalist agenda and relied on local stone for its finish   The west wing of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra designed by Ashton Raggatt McDougall  is a near exact replica of the Villa Savoye  except its black colour  This antipodean architectural quotation is according to Howard Raggat  a kind of inversion  a reflection  but also a kind of shadow    7  Footnotes  8  References  9  Further reading  10
