Mozambique   or    officially the Republic of Mozambique   or República de Moçambique     is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east  Tanzania to the north  Malawi and Zambia to the northwest  Zimbabwe to the west  and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest  It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east  The capital and largest city is Maputo  previously called Lourenço Marques before independence    Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD  Bantu speaking peoples migrated from farther north and west  Swahili  and later also Arab  commercial ports existed along the coasts until the arrival of Europeans  The area was explored by Vasco da Gama in 1498 and colonized by Portugal from 1505  After over four centuries of Portuguese rule  Mozambique gained independence in 1975  becoming the People s Republic of Mozambique shortly thereafter  After only two years of independence  the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting from 1977 to 1992  In 1994  Mozambique held its first multiparty elections and has remained a relatively stable presidential republic since   Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources  The country s economy is based largely on agriculture  but industry  mainly food and beverages  chemical manufacturing  aluminium and petroleum production  is growing  The country s tourism sector is also growing  South Africa is Mozambique s main trading partner and source of foreign direct investment  Portugal  Brazil  Spain and Belgium are also among the country s most important economic partners  Since 2001  Mozambique s annual average GDP growth has been among the world s highest  However  the country ranks among the lowest in GDP per capita  human development  measures of inequality  and average life expectancy   The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese  which is spoken mostly as a second language by about half of the population  Common native languages include Swahili  Makhuwa  and Sena  The country s population of around 24 million is composed overwhelmingly of Bantu people  The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity  with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions  Mozambique is a member of the African Union  Commonwealth of Nations  the Community of Portuguese Language Countries  the Latin Union  Non Aligned Movement and Southern African Development Community and an observer at La Francophonie   1  Etymology  The country was named Moçambique by the Portuguese after the Island of Mozambique  derived from Musa Al Big or Mossa Al Bique or Mussa Ben Mbiki  an Arab trader who first visited the island and later lived there  The island town was the capital of the Portuguese colony until 1898  when it was moved south to Lourenço Marques  now Maputo    2  History  2 1  Bantu migrations  Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD  waves of Bantu speaking people migrated from the west and north through the Zambezi River valley and then gradually into the plateau and coastal areas  They established agricultural communities or societies based on herding cattle  They brought with them the technology for iron making  a metal which they used to make weapons for the conquest of their neighbors  Cities in Mozambique during the Middle Ages  fifth to the 16th century  were not sturdily built  so there is little left of many medieval cities such as the trading port Sofala   2 2  Swahili  Arabs and Persians  Several Swahili trade ports dotted the coast of the country before the arrival of Arabs  who had been trading with Madagascar and the Far East   Coastal trade of Mozambique was at first dominated by Arabs and Persians  who had established settlements as far south as Mozambique Island   Swahili  Arab and Persian commercial settlements existed along the coast and outlying islands for several centuries   2 3  Portuguese Mozambique  1498–1975   From about 1500  Portuguese trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony  becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east   The voyage of Vasco da Gama around the Cape of Good Hope in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade  politics  and society of the region  The Portuguese gained control of the Island of Mozambique and the port city of Sofala in the early 16th century  and by the 1530s  small groups of Portuguese traders and prospectors seeking gold penetrated the interior regions  where they set up garrisons and trading posts at Sena and Tete on the River Zambezi and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade   The Portuguese attempted to legitimise and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of prazos  land grants  tied to Portuguese settlement and administration  While prazos were originally developed to be held by Portuguese  through intermarriage they became African Portuguese or African Indian centres defended by large African slave armies known as Chikunda  Historically within Mozambique there was slavery  Human beings were bought and sold by African tribal chiefs  Arab traders and Portuguese and other European traders as well  Many Mozambican slaves were supplied by tribal chiefs who raided warring tribes and sold their captives to the prazeiros   Although Portuguese influence gradually expanded  its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy  The Portuguese were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arabs between 1500 and 1700  but  with the Arab seizure of Portugal s key foothold at Fort Jesus on Mombasa Island  now in Kenya  in 1698  the pendulum began to swing in the other direction  As a result  investment lagged while Lisbon devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with India and the Far East and to the colonisation of Brazil   During these wars  the Mazrui and Omani Arabs reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade  forcing the Portuguese to retreat south  Many prazos had declined by the mid 19th century  but several of them survived  During the 19th century other European powers  particularly the British  British South Africa Company  and the French  Madagascar   became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the Portuguese East African territories   By the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies  like the Mozambique Company  the Zambezia Company and the Niassa Company  controlled and financed mostly by the British  which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies  South Africa and Rhodesia   Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique  at the end of the 19th century the Chartered companies enacted a forced labor policy and supplied cheap 舑 often forced 舑 African labour to the mines and plantations of the nearby British colonies and South Africa  The Zambezia Company  the most profitable chartered company  took over a number of smaller prazeiro holdings  and established military outposts to protect its property  The chartered companies built roads and ports to bring their goods to market including a railroad linking present day Zimbabwe with the Mozambican port of Beira   Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift  under the corporatist Estado Novo regime of Oliveira Salazar  towards a stronger Portuguese control of Portuguese Empire s economy  the companies  concessions were not renewed when they ran out  This was what happened in 1942 with the Mozambique Company  which however continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation  and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company s concession  In 1951  the Portuguese overseas colonies in Africa were rebranded as Overseas Provinces of Portugal   2 4  Mozambican War of Independence  1964 1974   As communist and anti colonial ideologies spread out across Africa  many clandestine political movements were established in support of Mozambican independence  These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of Mozambique s Portuguese population  little attention was paid to Mozambique s tribal integration and the development of its native communities   According to the official guerrilla statements  this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure  Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans  Statistically  Mozambique s Portuguese whites were indeed wealthier and more skilled than the black indigenous majority  As a response to the guerrilla movement  the Portuguese government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s  initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies for all   The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique  FRELIMO  initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964  This conflict   along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of Angola and Portuguese Guinea   became part of the so called Portuguese Colonial War  1961–1974   From a military standpoint  the Portuguese regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west  As part of their response to FRELIMO  the Portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth   2 5  Independence  1975   After 10 years of sporadic warfare and Portugal s return to democracy through a leftist military coup in Lisbon  which replaced Portugal s Estado Novo regime for a military junta  the Carnation Revolution of April 1974   FRELIMO took control of the territory  Within a year  most of the 250 000 Portuguese in Mozambique had left   some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory  some fleeing in fear   and Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975  In an act of vengeance  a law had been passed by the then relatively unknown Armando Guebuza in the FRELIMO party ordering the Portuguese to leave the country in 24 hours with only 20 kilograms  44 pounds  of luggage  Unable to salvage any of their assets  most of them returned to Portugal penniless   2 6  Mozambican Civil War  1977–1992   The new government  under president Samora Machel  established a one party state based on Marxist principles  The new government received diplomatic and some military support from Cuba and the Soviet Union and proceeded to crack down on opposition  Starting shortly after the independence  the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war between the opposition forces of anti Communist Mozambican National Resistance  RENAMO  rebel militias and the FRELIMO regime  This conflict  combined with sabotage from the neighbouring white ruled state of Rhodesia and the apartheid regime of South Africa  ineffective policies  failed central planning  and the resulting economic collapse  characterised the first decades of Mozambican independence  This period was also marked by the exodus of Portuguese nationals and Mozambicans of Portuguese heritage  a collapsed infrastructure  lack of investment in productive assets  and government nationalisation of privately owned industries as well as widespread famine   During most of the civil war  the FRELIMO formed central government was unable to exercise effective control outside of urban areas  many of which were cut off from the capital  It is reported that in RENAMO controlled areas  which included up to 50% of the rural areas in several provinces  health services of any kind were isolated from assistance for years  The problem worsened when the government cut back spending on health care  The war was marked by mass human rights violations from both sides of the conflict with RENAMO contributing to the chaos through the use of terror and indiscriminate targeting of civilians  The central government executed tens of thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country and sent many people to re education camps where thousands died   During the war RENAMO proposed a peace agreement based on the secession of RENAMO controlled northern and western territories as the independent Republic of Rombesia  but FRELIMO refused wanting sovereignty over the entire country  An estimated one million Mozambicans perished during the civil war  1 7 million took refuge in neighbouring states  and several million more were internally displaced  The FRELIMO regime also gave shelter and support to South African  African National Congress  and Zimbabwean  Zimbabwe African National Union  rebel movements while the governments of first Rhodesia and later South Africa  at that time still under the apartheid regime  backed RENAMO in the civil war   On 19 October 1986  Samora Machel was on his way back from an international meeting in Zambia in the presidential Tupolev Tu 134 aircraft when the plane crashed in the Lebombo Mountains  near Mbuzini  There were ten survivors  but President Machel and thirty three others died  including ministers and officials of the Mozambique government  The United Nations  Soviet delegation issued a minority report contending that their expertise and experience had been undermined by the South Africans  Representatives of the Soviet Union advanced the theory that the plane had been intentionally diverted by a false navigational beacon signal  using a technology provided by military intelligence operatives of the South African government   Machel s successor  Joaquim Chissano  implemented sweeping changes in the country  starting reforms such as changing from Marxism to capitalism  and began peace talks with RENAMO  The new constitution enacted in 1990 provided for a multi party political system  market based economy  and free elections  The civil war ended in October 1992 with the Rome General Peace Accords  first brokered by the CCM  the Christian Council of Mozambique  Council of Protestant Churches  and then taken over by Community of Sant Egidio  Under supervision of the ONUMOZ peacekeeping force of the United Nations  peace returned to Mozambique   By 1993 more than 1 5 million Mozambican refugees who had sought asylum in neighbouring Malawi  Zimbabwe  Swaziland  Zambia  Tanzania and South Africa as a result of war and drought had returned  as part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub Saharan Africa   2 7  Democratic era  1993    Mozambique held elections in 1994  which were accepted by most parties as free and fair while still contested by many nationals and observers alike  FRELIMO won  under Joaquim Chissano  while RENAMO  led by Afonso Dhlakama  ran as the official opposition   In 1995  Mozambique joined the Commonwealth of Nations  becoming  at the time  the only member nation that had never been part of the British Empire   By mid 1995  over 1 7 million refugees who had sought asylum in neighboring countries had returned to Mozambique  part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub Saharan Africa  An additional four million internally displaced persons had returned to their homes   In December 1999  Mozambique held elections for a second time since the civil war  which were again won by FRELIMO  RENAMO accused FRELIMO of fraud  and threatened to return to civil war  but backed down after taking the matter to the Supreme Court and losing   In early 2000 a cyclone caused widespread flooding in the country  killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure  There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources have been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO  Carlos Cardoso  a journalist investigating these allegations  was murdered but his death was not satisfactorily explained   Indicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term  Chissano criticized leaders who stayed on longer than he had  which was generally seen as a reference to Zambian president Frederick Chiluba  who at the time was considering a third term  and Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe  then in his fourth term  Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on December 1–2  2004  FRELIMO candidate Armando Guebuza won with 64% of the popular vote  His opponent  Afonso Dhlakama of RENAMO  received 32% of the popular vote  FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament  A coalition of RENAMO and several small parties won the 90 remaining seats  Armando Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on February 2  2005   3  Geography and climate  At   Mozambique is the world s 35th largest country  It is comparable in size to Turkey  Mozambique is located on the southeast coast of Africa  It is bound by Swaziland to the south  South Africa to the southwest  Zimbabwe to the west  Zambia and Malawi to the northwest  Tanzania to the north and the Indian Ocean to the east  Mozambique lies between latitudes 10° and 27°S  and longitudes 30° and 41°E   The country is divided into two topographical regions by the Zambezi River  To the north of the Zambezi River  the narrow coastline moves inland to hills and low plateaus  and further west to rugged highlands  which include the Niassa highlands  Namuli or Shire highlands  Angonia highlands  Tete highlands and the Makonde plateau  covered with miombo woodlands  To the south of the Zambezi River  the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and Lebombo Mountains located in the deep south   The country is drained by five principal rivers and several smaller ones with the largest and most important the Zambezi  The country has four notable lakes  Lake Niassa  or Malawi   Lake Chiuta  Lake Cahora Bassa and Lake Shirwa  all in the north  The major cities are Maputo  Beira  Nampula  Tete  Quelimane  Chimoio  Pemba  Inhambane  Xai Xai and Lichinga   3 1  Climate  Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons  a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September  Climatic conditions  however  vary depending on altitude  Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south  Annual precipitation varies from depending on the region  with an average of   Cyclones are common during the wet season  Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from in July to in February   4  Politics  Mozambique is a multi party democracy under the 1990 constitution  The executive branch comprises a president  prime minister  and Council of Ministers  There is a National Assembly and municipal assemblies   The judiciary comprises a Supreme Court and provincial  district  and municipal courts  Suffrage is universal at eighteen   4 1  Political culture  In the 1994 elections  Joaquim Chissano was elected President with 53% of the vote  and a 250 member National Assembly was voted in with 129 Liberation Front of Mozambique  FRELIMO  deputies  112 Mozambican National Resistance  RENAMO  deputies  and nine representatives of three smaller parties that formed the Democratic Union  UD   Since its formation in 1994  the National Assembly has made progress in becoming a body increasingly more independent of the executive  By 1999  more than one half  53%  of the legislation passed originated in the Assembly   After some delays  in 1998 the country held its first local elections to provide for local representation and some budgetary authority at the municipal level  The principal opposition party  RENAMO  boycotted the local elections  citing flaws in the registration process  Independent slates contested the elections and won seats in municipal assemblies  Turnout was very low   In the aftermath of the 1998 local elections  the government resolved to make more accommodations to the opposition s procedural concerns for the second round of multiparty national elections in 1999  Working through the National Assembly  the electoral law was rewritten and passed by consensus in December 1998  Financed largely by international donors  a very successful voter registration was conducted from July to September 1999  providing voter registration cards to 85% of the potential electorate  more than seven million voters    The second general elections were held 3–5 December 1999  with high voter turnout  International and domestic observers agreed that the voting process was well organized and went smoothly  Both the opposition and observers subsequently cited flaws in the tabulation process that  had they not occurred  might have changed the outcome  In the end  however  international and domestic observers concluded that the close result of the vote reflected the will of the people   President Chissano won the presidency with a margin of 4% over the RENAMO Electoral Union coalition candidate  Afonso Dhlakama  and began his five year term in January 2000  FRELIMO increased its majority in the National Assembly with 133 out of 250 seats  RENAMO UE coalition won 116 seats  one went independent  and no third parties are represented   The opposition coalition did not accept the National Election Commission s results of the presidential vote and filed a formal complaint to the Supreme Court  One month after the voting  the court dismissed the opposition s challenge and validated the election results  The opposition did not file a complaint about the results of the legislative vote   The second local elections  involving thirty three municipalities with some 2 4 million registered voters  took place in November 2003  This was the first time that FRELIMO  RENAMO UE  and independent parties competed without significant boycotts  The 24% turnout was well above the 15% turnout in the first municipal elections  FRELIMO won twenty eight mayoral positions and the majority in twenty nine municipal assemblies  while RENAMO won five mayoral positions and the majority in four municipal assemblies  The voting was conducted in an orderly fashion without violent incidents  However  the period immediately after the elections was marked by objections about voter and candidate registration and vote tabulation  as well as calls for greater transparency   In May 2009  the government approved a new general elections law that contained innovations based on the experience of the 2003 municipal elections  Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004  FRELIMO candidate Armando Guebuza won with 64% of the popular vote  His opponent  Afonso Dhlakama of RENAMO  received 32% of the popular vote  FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament  A coalition of RENAMO and several small parties won the 90 remaining seats  Armando Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005   RENAMO and some other opposition parties made claims of election fraud and denounced the result  These claims were supported by international observers  among others by the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Centre  to the elections who criticised the fact that the National Electoral Commission  CNE  did not conduct fair and transparent elections  They listed a whole range of shortcomings by the electoral authorities that benefited the ruling party FRELIMO   According to EU observers  the elections shortcomings have probably not affected the final result in the presidential election  On the other hand  the observers have declared that the outcome of the parliamentary election and thus the distribution of seats in the National Assembly does not reflect the will of the Mozambican people and is clearly to the disadvantage of RENAMO   After a clashes between Renamo guards and the police in Muxungue and Gondola in April 2013  Renamo said it would boycott and disrupt local elections in November 2013  Since the end of the civil war in 1992 about 300 Renamo guards had remained armed and refused to join the national army or police force   4 2  Foreign relations  While allegiances dating back to the liberation struggle remain relevant  Mozambique s foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic  The twin pillars of Mozambique s foreign policy are maintenance of good relations with its neighbors and maintenance and expansion of ties to development partners   During the 1970s and the early 1980s  Mozambique s foreign policy was inextricably linked to the struggles for majority rule in Rhodesia and South Africa as well as superpower competition and the Cold War  Mozambique s decision to enforce UN sanctions against Rhodesia and deny that country access to the sea led Ian Smith s government to undertake overt and covert actions to oppose the country  Although the change of government in Zimbabwe in 1980 removed this threat  the government of South Africa continued to back RENAMO in its war with the FRELIMO government  Mozambique also belonged to the Front Line States   The 1984 Nkomati Accord  while failing in its goal of ending South African support to RENAMO  opened initial diplomatic contacts between the Mozambican and South African governments  This process gained momentum with South Africa s elimination of apartheid  which culminated in the establishment of full diplomatic relations in October 1993  While relations with neighbouring Zimbabwe  Malawi  Zambia and Tanzania show occasional strains  Mozambique s ties to these countries remain strong   In the years immediately following its independence  Mozambique benefited from considerable assistance from some Western countries  notably the Scandinavians  The Soviet Union and its allies became Mozambique s primary economic  military and political supporters  and its foreign policy reflected this linkage  This began to change in 1983  in 1984 Mozambique joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  Western aid by the Scandinavian countries of Sweden  Norway  Denmark and Iceland quickly replaced Soviet support  Finland and the Netherlands are becoming increasingly important sources of development assistance  Italy also maintains a profile in Mozambique as a result of its key role during the peace process  Relations with Portugal  the former colonial power  continue to be important because Portuguese investors play a visible role in Mozambique s economy   Mozambique is a member of the Non Aligned Movement and ranks among the moderate members of the African bloc in the United Nations and other international organisations  Mozambique also belongs to the African Union  formerly the Organisation of African Unity  and the Southern African Development Community  In 1994  the government became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference  in part to broaden its base of international support but also to please the country s sizable Muslim population  Similarly  in early 1996 Mozambique joined its Anglophone neighbours in the Commonwealth of Nations  At the time it was the only nation to have joined the Commonwealth that was never part of the British Empire  In the same year  Mozambique became a founding member and the first President of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries  CPLP   and maintains close ties with other Portuguese speaking countries   4 3  Administrative divisions  Mozambique is divided into ten provinces  provincias  and one capital city  cidade capital  with provincial status  The provinces are subdivided into 129 districts  distritos   The districts are further divided in 405  Postos Administrativos   Administrative Posts  and then into Localidades  Localities   the lowest geographical level of the central state administration  Since 1998  53  Municípios   Municipalities  have been created in Mozambique   The districts of Mozambique are divided into 405 postos   Postos administrativos  administrative posts  are the main subdivisions of districts  This name  in use during colonial times  was abolished after independence and was replaced by localidades  localities   However  it was re established in 1986   Administrative posts are headed by a Secretários  secretaries   which before independence were called Chefes de Posto  post chiefs    Administrative posts can be further subdivided into localities  also headed by secretaries   5  Economy  The official currency is the New Metical  as of February 2013  1 USD is roughly equivalent to 30 New Meticals   which replaced old Meticals at the rate of a thousand to one  The old currency was redeemable at the Bank of Mozambique until the end of 2012  The US$  South African rand  and recently the euro are also widely accepted and used in business transactions  The minimum legal salary is around US$60 per month  Mozambique is a member of the Southern African Development Community  SADC   The SADC free trade protocol is aimed at making the Southern African region more competitive by eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers  The World Bank in 2007 talked of Mozambique s  blistering pace of economic growth   A joint donor government study in early 2007 said  Mozambique is generally considered an aid success story   The IMF in early 2007 said  Mozambique is a success story in Sub Saharan Africa   Yet  despite this apparent success  both the World Bank and UNICEF used the word  paradox  to describe rising chronic child malnutrition in the face of GDP growth  Between 1994 and 2006  average annual GDP growth was approximately 8%  however  the country remains one of the poorest and most underdeveloped in the world  In a 2006 survey  three quarters of Mozambicans said that in the past five years their economic position had remained the same or become worse   5 1  Rebounding growth  The resettlement of civil war refugees and successful economic reform have led to a high growth rate  the country enjoyed a remarkable recovery  achieving an average annual rate of economic growth of 8% between 1996 and 2006 and between 6%–7% from 2006 to 2011  The devastating floods of early 2000 slowed GDP growth to 2 1% but a full recovery was achieved in 2001 with growth of 14 8%    Rapid expansion in the future hinged on several major foreign investment projects  continued economic reform  and the revival of the agriculture  transportation  and tourism sectors  In 2013 about 80% of the population was employed in agriculture  the majority of whom were engaged in small scale subsistence farming which still suffered from inadequate infrastructure  commercial networks  and investment  However  in 2012  more than 90% of Mozambique s arable land was still uncultivated   In 2013  a BBC article reported that  starting in 2009  Portuguese had been returning to Mozambique because of the growing economy in Mozambique and the poor economic situation in Portugal   5 2  Economic reforms  More than 1 200 state owned enterprises  mostly small  have been privatised  Preparations for privatisation and or sector liberalisation are underway for the remaining parastatal enterprises  including telecommunications  energy  ports  and railways  The government frequently selects a strategic foreign investor when privatising a parastatal  Additionally  customs duties have been reduced  and customs management has been streamlined and reformed  The government introduced a value added tax in 1999 as part of its efforts to increase domestic revenues  Plans for 2003–04 include Commercial Code reform  comprehensive judicial reform  financial sector strengthening  continued civil service reform  and improved government budget  audit  and inspection capability  Further political instability resulting from the floods left thousands homeless  displaced within their own country   5 3  Corruption  Mozambique s economy has been shaken by a number of corruption scandals  In July 2011  the government proposed new anti corruption laws to criminalise embezzlement  influence peddling and graft  following numerous instances of theft of public money  This has been endorsed by the country s Council of Ministers  Mozambique has convicted two former ministers for graft in the past two years   Mozambique was ranked 116 of 178 countries in anti graft watchdog Transparency International s latest index of global corruption  According to a USAID report written in 2005  “the scale and scope of corruption in Mozambique are cause for alarm ”  In March 2012  the government of the southern Mozambican province of Inhambane uncovered the misappropriation of public funds by the director of the Provincial Anti Drugs Office  Calisto Alberto Tomo  He was found to have colluded with the accountant in the Anti Drugs Office  Recalda Guambe  to steal over 260 000 meticais between 2008 and 2010   5 4  Natural resources  In 2012  large natural gas reserves were discovered in Mozambique  revenues from which might dramatically change the economy   5 5  Tourism  Mozambique attracts tourists  The country s natural beauty  wildlife  and historic heritage provide opportunities for beach  cultural  and eco tourism   5 6  Transport  6  Demographics  The north central provinces of Zambezia and Nampula are the most populous  with about 45% of the population  The estimated four million Macua are the dominant group in the northern part of the country  the Sena and Shona  mostly Ndau  are prominent in the Zambezi valley  and the Shangaan  Tsonga  dominate in southern Mozambique  Other groups include Makonde  Yao  Swahili  Tonga  Chopi  and Nguni  including Zulu   Bantu people comprise 97 8% of the population  with the rest including White Africans  largely of Portuguese ancestry   Euro Africans  mestiço people of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage   and Indians  Roughly 45 000 people of Indian descent reside in Mozambique   During Portuguese colonial rule  a large minority of people of Portuguese descent lived permanently in almost all areas of the country  and Mozambicans with Portuguese blood at the time of independence numbered about 360 000  Many of these left the country after independence from Portugal in 1975  There are various estimates for the size of Mozambique s Chinese community  ranging from 7 000 to 12 000    According to a 2011 survey  the total fertility rate was 5 9 children per woman  with 6 6 in rural areas and 4 5 in urban areas   6 1  Largest cities  Gaza  6 2  Languages  Portuguese is the official and most widely spoken language of the nation  spoken by 50 3% of the population  Most Mozambicans living in the cities speak Portuguese as their first language   The Bantu group languages of Mozambique that are indigenous to the country vary greatly in their groupings and in some cases are rather poorly appreciated and documented  Apart from its lingua franca uses in the north of the country  Swahili is spoken in a small area of the coast next to the Tanzanian border  south of this  towards Moçambique Island  Kimwani  regarded as a dialect of Swahili  is used  Immediately inland of the Swahili area  Makonde is used  separated farther inland by a small strip of Makhuwa speaking territory from an area where Yao or ChiYao is used  Makonde and Yao belong to a different group  Yao being very close to the Mwera language of the Rondo Plateau area in Tanzania   Prepositions appear in these languages as locative prefixes prefixed to the noun and declined according to their own noun class  Some Nyanja is used at the coast of Lake Malawi  as well as on the other side of the Lake bordering on Malawi   Somewhat different from all of these are the languages of the eMakhuwa group  with a loss of initial k   which means that many nouns begin with a vowel  for example  epula    rain    There is eMakhuwa proper  with the related eLomwe and eChuwabo  with a small eKoti speaking area at the coast  In an area straddling the lower Zambezi  Sena  which belongs to the same group as Nyanja  is spoken  with areas speaking the related CiNyungwe and CiSenga further upriver   A large Shona speaking area extends between the Zimbabwe border and the sea  this was formerly known the Ndau variety but now uses the orthography of the Standard Shona of Zimbabwe  Apparently similar to Shona  but lacking the tone patterns of the Shona language  and regarded by its speakers as quite separate  is CiBalke  also called Rue or Barwe  used in a small country near the Zimbabwe border   South of this area are languages of the Shangaan group  which are quite different again  XiTswa or Tswa occurs at the coast and inland  XiTsonga or Tsonga straddles the area around the Limpopo River  including such local dialects as XiChangana  This language area extends into neighbouring South Africa  Still related to these  but distinct  are GiTonga and CiCopi or Chopi spoken north of the mouth of the Limpopo  and XiRonga or Ronga in the immediate region around Maputo  The languages in this group are  judging by the short vocabularies  very vaguely similar to Zulu  but obviously not in the same immediate group  There are small Swazi  and Zulu speaking areas in Mozambique immediately next to the Swaziland and KwaZulu Natal borders   Arabs  Chinese and Indians primarily speak Portuguese and some Hindi  Indians from Portuguese India speak any of the Portuguese Creoles of their origin aside from Portuguese as their second language   6 3  Religion  The 2007 census found that Christians made up 56 1% of Mozambique s population and Muslims comprised 17 9% of the population  7 3% of the people held other beliefs  mainly animism  and 18 7% had no religious beliefs   The Roman Catholic Church has established twelve dioceses  Beira  Chimoio  Gurué  Inhambane  Lichinga  Maputo  Nacala  Nampula  Pemba  Quelimane    and Xai Xai  archdioceses are Beira  Maputo and Nampula   Statistics for the dioceses range from a low 5 8% Catholics in the population in the diocese of Chimoio  to 32 50% in Quelimane diocese  Anuario catolico de Mocambique 2007    The work of Methodism in Mozambique started in 1890  The Rev  Dr  Erwin Richards began a Methodist mission at Chicuque in Inhambane Province  A Igreja Metodista Unida em Moçambique  the UMC in Mozambique  observed the 100th anniversary of Methodist presence in Mozambique in 1990  Then Mozambique President Chissano praised the work and role of the UMC to more than 10 000 people who attended the ceremony   The United Methodist Church has tripled in size in Mozambique since 1998  There are now more than 150 000 members in more than 180 congregations of the 24 districts  New pastors are ordained each year  New churches are chartered each year in each Annual Conference  North and South    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church  has established a growing presence in Mozambique  It first began sending missionaries to Mozambique in 1999  and  as of December 2012  has more than 6 029 members   The Bahá í Faith has been present in Mozambique since the early 1950s but did not openly identify itself in those years because of the strong influence of the Catholic Church which did not recognise it officially as a world religion  The independence in 1975 saw the entrance of new pioneers  In total there are about 3 000 declared Baha is in Mozambique as of 2010  The Administrative Committee is located in Maputo   Muslims are particularly present in the north of the country  They are organised in several  tariqa  or brotherhoods  Two national organisations also exist – the Conselho Islâmico de Moçambique and the Congresso Islâmico de Moçambique  There are also important Indo Pakistani associations as well as some Shia communities   Among the main Protestant churches are Igreja União Baptista de Moçambique  the Assembleias de Deus  the Seventh day Adventists  the Anglican Church of Southern Africa  the Igreja do Evangelho Completo de Deus  the Igreja Metodista Unida  the Igreja Presbiteriana de Moçambique  the Igrejas de Cristo and the Assembleia Evangélica de Deus   Communications in Mozambique  Liga dos Escuteiros de Moçambique  Protected areas of Mozambique  Military of Mozambique  Public holidays in Mozambique  Transport in Mozambique  6 4  Health  The fertility rate is at about 5 5 births per woman  Public expenditure on health was at 2 7% of the GDP in 2004  whereas private expenditure on health was at 1 3% in the same year  Health expenditure per capita was 42 US$  PPP  in 2004  In the early 21st century there were 3 physicians per 100 000 people in the country  Infant mortality was at 100 per 1 000 births in 2005   After its independence from Portugal in 1975  the Mozambique government established a primary health care system that was cited by the WHO as a model for other developing countries  Over 90% of the population had been provided with vaccination  During the period of the early 1980s  around 11% of the government budget was targeted on health care  The Mozambique civil war led to a great setback in the primary health system in Mozambique  The RENAMO s attack on government infrastructures included health and education systems from 1980 to 1992   In June 2011  the United Nations Population Fund released a report on   It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries  The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100 000 births for Mozambique is 550  This is compared with 598 8 in 2008 and 385 in 1990  The under 5 mortality rate  per 1 000 births is 147 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5s mortality is 29  The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved  particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal death  In Mozambique the number of midwives per 1 000 live births is 3 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 37   The official prevalence of HIV in Mozambique in 2011 was 11 5% for the population in the age range between 15 and 49 years  For the southern parts of the country   Maputo and Gaza provinces  and city of Maputo itself   the official figures are more than twice as high as the national average  In 2011 the health authorities estimated about 1 7 million Mozambicans were HIV positive  of whom 600 000 were in need of anti retroviral treatment  As per December 2011 240 000 were receiving such treatment  increasing to 416 000 in March 2014 according to the health authorities  According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report  the HIV AIDS epidemic in Mozambique seems to be leveling off   As NGOs do for many developing countries  Mozambique is supported by the rest of the world  Due to foreign aid management difficulties and the inequity of the local community  the NGOs fragment the primary health care system in Mozambique  It is the time that foreign aids and NGOs can think of a new way to help developing countries like Mozambique   Health researcher  James Pfeiffer argues that in addition to installing a new aid management strategy  a new paradigm of cooperation must be formed in order to facilitate the exchange between aid workers and the local health workers in the developing world  The new paradigm will help to promote a long lasting positive impact on the local health institutions and strengthen the professional relationship between the health workers   6 5  Education  Since independence from Portugal in 1975  school construction and teacher training enrollments have not kept up with population increases  Especially after the Mozambican Civil War  1977–1992   with post war enrollments reaching all time highs due to stability and youth population growth  the quality of education has suffered  All Mozambicans are required by law to attend school through the primary level  however  a lot of children in Mozambique do not go to primary school because they have to work for their families  subsistence farms for a living  In 2007  one million children still did not go to school  most of them from poor rural families  and almost half of all teachers in Mozambique were still unqualified  Girls’ enrollment increased from 3 million in 2002 to 4 1 million in 2006 while the completion rate increased from 31 000 to 90 000  which testified a very poor completion rate   After grade 7  pupils must take standardised national exams to enter secondary school  which runs from eighth to 10th grade  Space in Mozambican universities is extremely limited  thus most pupils who complete pre university school do not immediately proceed on to university studies  Many go to work as teachers or are unemployed  There are also institutes which give more vocational training  specialising in agricultural  technical or pedagogical studies  which students may attend after grade 10 in lieu of a pre university school   After independence from Portugal in 1975  a number of Mozambican pupils continued to be admitted every year at Portuguese high schools  polytechnical institutes and universities  through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese government and the Mozambican government   According to 2010 estimates  the literacy rate of Mozambique is 56 1%  70 8% male and 42 8% female    7  Culture  7 1  Music  The music of Mozambique can serve many purposes  ranging from religious expression to traditional ceremonies  Musical instruments are usually handmade  Some of the instruments used in Mozambican musical expression include drums made of wood and animal skin  the lupembe  a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood  and the marimba  which is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique   The marimba is a popular instrument with the Chopi of the south central coast who are famous for their musical skill and dance  Some would say that Mozambique s music is similar to reggae and West Indian calypso  Other music types are popular in Mozambique like marrabenta  and other Lusophone music forms like fado  samba  bossa nova  maxixe  with origins from Maxixe  and kizomba    7 2  Arts  The Makonde are renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks  see picture below  that are commonly used in traditional dances  There are two different kinds of wood carvings  Shetani   evil spirits   which are mostly carved in heavy ebony  tall  and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces  The Ujamaa are totem type carvings which illustrate lifelike faces of people and various figures  Theses sculptures are usually referred to as  family trees  because they tell stories of many generations   During the last years of the colonial period  Mozambican art reflected the oppression by the colonial power  and became symbol of the resistance  After independence in 1975  the modern art came into a new phase  The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter Malangatana Ngwenya and the sculptor Alberto Chissano  A lot of the post independence art during the 1980s and 1990s reflect the political struggle  civil war  suffering  starvation  and struggle   Dances are usually intricate  highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique  There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature  The Chopi  for instance  act out battles dressed in animal skins  The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours  Groups of women in the northern part of the country perform a traditional dance called tufo  to celebrate Islamic holidays   7 3  Cuisine  Present for nearly 500 years  the Portuguese greatly impacted the cuisine of Mozambique  Staples and crops such as cassava  a starchy root of Brazilian origin   cashew nuts  also of Brazilian origin  though Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts  and pãozinho  pronounced   those are Portuguese style French buns  were brought in by the Portuguese  The use of spices and seasonings such as onions  bay leaves  garlic  fresh coriander  paprika  chili peppers  red sweet peppers and wine were introduced by the Portuguese  as were sugarcane  maize  millet  rice  sorghum  a type of grass  and potatoes  Prego  steak roll   rissóis  battered shrimp   espetada  kebab   pudim  pudding   and the popular inteiro com piripiri  whole chicken in piri piri sauce  are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present day Mozambique   7 4  Entertainment  The T V  stations watched by Mozambicans are TVM Televisão Moçambique  STV and TIM  Through cable and satellite  viewers can access tens of other Africa  European  Brazilian and Asian channels   Football    is the most popular sport in Mozambique  Nightlife is very dynamic   7 5  National holidays  7 6  Cultural identity  Mozambique was ruled by Portugal and they share in common a main language and their main religion  Roman Catholicism   But since most of the people are Bantus  most of the culture is native and for Bantus living in urban areas with some Portuguese influence  Mozambican culture influences the Portuguese culture  Mozambican music  movies  by RTP África   food  and traditions are now part of everyday lifestyles of Portugal   8  See also  Outline of Mozambique  Index of Mozambique related articles  9  References  10  Bibliography  Abrahamsson  Hans
