Woodwind instruments are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments  There are two main types of woodwind instruments  flutes and reed instruments  otherwise called reed pipes   What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound   1  Flutes  Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube  The flute family can be divided into two sub families  open flutes  and closed flutes   To produce a sound with open flutes  the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream   This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flutes hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute  panpipes and ocarinas  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses  reeds  and hollowed out tree branches  Later  flutes were made of metals such as tin  copper  or bronze  Modern concert flutes are usually made of high grade metal alloys  usually containing nickel  silver  copper  or gold   To produce a sound with a closed flute  the player is required to blow air into a duct  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge  As with the open flutes  the air is then split  this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder  instrument   and organ pipes   2  Reed instruments  Reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed  or reeds  to vibrate  Similar to flutes  Reed pipes are also further divided into two types  single reed and double reed   Single reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece  using a ligature   When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece  the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound  Single reed instruments include the clarinet  saxophone  and others such as the chalumeau   Double reed instruments use two precisely cut  small pieces of cane bound together at the base  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period  its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush  The finished  bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces  again  causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub families  exposed double reed  and capped double reed instruments   Exposed double reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player s lips  This family includes instruments such as the oboe  cor anglais  also called English horn  and bassoon  and many types of shawms throughout the world   On the other hand  Capped double reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap  The player blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds  This family includes the crumhorn   Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds  However  bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player s lips   Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by  free reeds  – small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath  e g  harmonica   or by bellows  e g  accordion    3  Modern orchestra and concert band woodwinds  The modern orchestra s woodwind section typically includes  flutes  oboes  clarinets  and bassoons  The piccolo  cor anglais  bass clarinet  and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments  The section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone s    The concert band s woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra s  The concert band s woodwind section typically includes  piccolo  flutes  oboes  B clarinets  bass clarinets  bassoons  alto saxophones  tenor saxophone  and baritone saxophone  The cor anglais  E clarinet  alto clarinet  contra alto clarinet  contrabass clarinet  contrabassoon  and soprano saxophone are also used  but not as frequently as the other woodwinds   4  See also  Brass instrument  Musical instrument  Wind instrument  5  References  6  External links
