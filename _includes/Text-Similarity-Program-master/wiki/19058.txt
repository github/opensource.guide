Munich          is the capital and largest city of the German state of Bavaria  on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps  Munich is the third largest city in Germany  after Berlin and Hamburg  with a population of around 1 49 million  The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 5 6 million people   The name of the city is derived from the Old High German term Munichen  meaning  by the monks   It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich  hence the monk depicted on the city s coat of arms  Munich was first mentioned in 1158  From 1255 the city was seat of the Bavarian Dukes  Black and gold — the colours of the Holy Roman Empire — have been the city s official colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian  when it was an imperial residence  Following a final reunification of the Wittelsbachian Duchy of Bavaria  previously divided and sub divided for more than 200 years  the town became the country s sole capital in 1506  Catholic Munich was a cultural stronghold of the Counter Reformation and a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years  War  but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes  as the townsfolk would rather open the gates of their town than risk siege and almost inevitable destruction  Like wide parts of the Holy Roman Empire  the area recovered slowly economically  Having evolved from a duchy s capital into that of an electorate  1623   and later a sovereign kingdom  1806   Munich has been a centre of arts  culture and science since the early 19th century  The city became the Nazi movement s infamous Hauptstadt der Bewegung  lit    Capital of the movement    and after post war reconstruction was the host city of the 1972 Summer Olympics   Munich is home to many national and international authorities  major universities  major museums and theaters  Its numerous architectural attractions  international sports events  exhibitions  conferences and Oktoberfest attract considerable tourism  Since 2006  the city s motto has been      Munich loves you    Munich is a traffic hub with excellent international  national and local connections  running a fast and reliable public transport system  It is a centre of finance  publishing and advanced technologies  Munich is one of the most prosperous and fastest growing cities in Germany  and the seat of numerous corporations and insurance companies  It is a top ranked destination for migration and expatriate location  despite being the municipality with the highest density of population  4 500 inh  per km²  in Germany  Munich achieved fourth place in the frequently quoted Mercer livability rankings in 2011 and 2012  For economic and social innovation  the city was ranked 15th globally out of 289 cities in 2010  and 5th in Germany by the 2thinknow Innovation Cities Index based on analysis of 162 indicators  In 2013  Monocle ranked Munich as the world s most livable city with the highest quality of life   1  History  1 1  Origin as medieval town  The year 1158 is assumed to be the foundation date  which is the earliest date the city is mentioned in a document  The document was signed in Augsburg  By that time the Guelph Henry the Lion  Duke of Saxony and Bavaria  had built a bridge over the river Isar next to a settlement of Benedictine monks—this was on the Old Salt Route and a toll bridge   In 1175  Munich was officially granted city status and received fortification  In 1180  with the trial of Henry the Lion  Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria and Munich was handed over to the Bishop of Freising   Wittelsbach s heirs  the Wittelsbach dynasty  would rule Bavaria until 1918   In 1240  Munich was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255  when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two  Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria   Duke Louis IV was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328  He strengthened the city s position by granting it the salt monopoly  thus assuring it of additional income  In the late 15th century Munich underwent a revival of gothic arts—the Old Town Hall was enlarged  and Munich s largest gothic church  now a cathedral—the Frauenkirche—constructed in only twenty years  starting in 1468   1 2  Capital of reunited Bavaria  When Bavaria was reunited in 1506  Munich became its capital  The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court  see Orlando di Lasso  Heinrich Schuetz and later Mozart and Richard Wagner   During the 16th century Munich was a centre of the German counter reformation  and also of renaissance arts  Duke Wilhelm V commissioned the Jesuit Michaelskirche  which became a centre for the counter reformation  and also built the Hofbräuhaus for brewing brown beer in 1589  The Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609  In 1623 during the Thirty Years  War Munich became electoral residence when Maximilian I  Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden  When the bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635 about one third of the population died  Under the regency of the Bavarian electors Munich was an important centre of baroque life but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742   In 1806  the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria  with the state s parliament  the Landtag  and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising being located in the city  Twenty years later Landshut University was moved to Munich  Many of the city s finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings  Later Prince Regent Luitpold s years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich  see Franz von Stuck and Der Blaue Reiter    1 3  World War I to World War II  Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914  life in Munich became very difficult  as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages  During French air raids in 1916  three bombs fell on Munich  After World War I  the city was at the centre of much political unrest  In November 1918 on the eve of revolution  Ludwig III and his family fled the city  After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley  the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed  When Communists had taken power  Lenin  who had lived in Munich some years before  sent a congratulatory telegram  but the Soviet Republic was put down on 3 May 1919 by the Freikorps  While the republican government had been restored  Munich subsequently became a hotbed of extremist politics  among which Adolf Hitler and the National Socialism rose to prominence   In 1923 Hitler and his supporters  who were then concentrated in Munich  staged the Beer Hall Putsch  an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power  The revolt failed  resulting in Hitler s arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party  which was virtually unknown outside Munich   The city once again became a Nazi stronghold when the National Socialists took power in Germany in 1933  The National Socialist Workers Party created their first concentration camp at Dachau  north west of the city  Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism  Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung   Capital of the Movement    The NSDAP headquarters was in Munich and many Führerbauten   Führer buildings   were built around the Königsplatz  some of which have survived to this day   The city is known as the site of the culmination of the policy of appeasement employed by Britain and France leading up to World War II  It was in Munich that British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain assented to the annexation of Czechoslovakia s Sudetenland region into Greater Germany in the hopes of sating the desires of Hitler s Third Reich   Munich was the base of the White Rose  a student resistance movement from June 1942 to February 1943  The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in Munich University by Hans and Sophie Scholl   The city was heavily damaged by allied bombing during World War II — the city was hit by 71 air raids over a period of five years   1 4  Postwar  After US occupation in 1945  Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous and — by comparison to other war ravaged West German cities— rather conservative plan which preserved its pre war street grid  In 1957 Munich s population passed the 1 million mark   Munich was the site of the 1972 Summer Olympics  during which Israeli athletes were assassinated by Palestinian fedayeen in the Munich massacre  when gunmen from the Palestinian  Black September  group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team   Most Munich residents enjoy a high quality of life  Mercer HR Consulting consistently rates the city among the top 10 cities with the highest quality of life worldwide — a 2011 survey ranked Munich as 4th  The same company also ranks Munich as the world s 39th most expensive city to live in and the most expensive major city in Germany  Munich enjoys a thriving economy  driven by the information technology  biotechnology  and publishing sectors  Environmental pollution is low  although as of 2006 the city council is concerned about levels of particulate matter  PM   especially along the city s major thoroughfares  Since the enactment of EU legislation concerning the concentration of particulate in the air  environmental groups such as Greenpeace have staged large protest rallies to urge the city council and the State government to take a harder stance on pollution   Today  the crime rate is low compared with other large German cities  such as Hamburg or Berlin  For its high quality of life and safety the city has been nicknamed  Toytown  among the English speaking residents  German inhabitants call it  Millionendorf   an expression which means  village of a million people    2  Geography  Munich lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria  about north of the northern edge of the Alps  at an altitude of about ASL  The local rivers are the Isar and the Würm  Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland  The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps  while the southern part is covered with morainic hills  Between these are fields of fluvio glacial out wash  such as around Munich  Wherever these deposits get thinner  the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area  leading to marshes as in the north of Munich   2 1  Climate  Munich s climate is classified in the Köppen classification as Cfb  Oceanic    The warmest month of the year  on average  is July  The coolest month of the year  on average  is January   Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation totals in late spring and throughout the summer  June  on average  records the most precipitation of any month  The winter months tend to bring lower precipitation  on average  and February averages the least amount of monthly precipitation for the year   The higher elevation of Munich and the proximity of the Alps play a significant role on the climate  causing the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany  The Alps affect the city s climate in other ways too  the warm downhill wind from the Alps  föhn wind   which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter is but one example   Being at the center of Europe  Munich is subject to many climatic influences  so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European towns  especially those further west and south of the Alps  At Munich s official weather station  the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37 1 °C  on 13 August 2003  and  31 6 °C  on 12 February 1929   3  Demographics  In July 2007  Munich had 1 34 million inhabitants  300

Serbs  24 439   Greeks  22 486   Austrians  21 411   and Italians  20 847   37% of foreign nationals come from the European Union   From only 24 000 inhabitants in 1700  the population doubled about every 30 years  For example  it had 100 000 people in 1852 and then 250 000 people in 1883  by 1901  the figure had doubled again to 500 000  Since then  Munich has become Germany s third largest city  In 1933  840 901 inhabitants were counted and in 1957  Munich s population passed the 1 million mark   49 3% of Munich s residents are not affiliated with any religious group  and this ratio represents the fastest growing segment of the population  As in the rest of Germany  the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches have experienced a continuous  slow decline in their memberships  As of 31 December 2010  36 8% of the city s inhabitants were Roman Catholic  13 6% Protestant  and 0 3% Jewish  There is also a small Old Catholic parish and an English speaking parish of the Episcopal Church in the city  There are also a significant number of Muslims living in Munich   4  Politics  Munich s current mayor is Dieter Reiter of the Social Democratic Party of Germany  Munich has been governed by the SPD for all but six years since 1948  This is remarkable because Bavaria—and particularly southern Bavaria—has long been a conservative stronghold  with the Christian Social Union winning absolute majorities among the Bavarian electorate in many elections at the communal  state  and federal levels  and leading the Bavarian state government for all but three years since 1946  Bavaria s second most populous city  Nuremberg  is also one of the very few Bavarian cities governed by a SPD led coalition   As the capital of the Free State of Bavaria  Munich is an important

EDDM  is the second largest airport in Germany and seventh largest in Europe after London Heathrow  Paris Charle de Gaulle  Frankfurt  Amsterdam  Madrid and Istanbul Atatürk  It is used by about 34 million passengers a year  and lies some north east of the city centre  It replaced the smaller Munich Riem airport in 1992  The airport can be reached by suburban train lines S8 from the east and S1 from the west of the city  From the main railway station the journey takes 40–45 minutes  An express train will be added that will cut down travel time to 20–25 minutes with limited stops on dedicated tracks  A magnetic levitation train  called Transrapid   which was to have run at speeds of up to from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes  had been approved  but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests  Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003   12 2  Other airports  In 2008  the Bavarian state government granted a license to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich  for commercial use  These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local Government  including the city of Munich  which took the case to court  However  in October 2009  the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge   Despite being from Munich  Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West  After 2005  passenger traffic of nearby Augsburg Airport was relocated to Munich Airport  leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach   12 3  Public transportation  For its urban population of 2 6 million people  Munich and its closest suburbs have one of the most comprehensive and punctual systems in the world  incorporating the Munich U Bahn  underground railway   the Munich S Bahn  suburban trains   trams and buses  The system is supervised by the Munich Transport and Tariff Association  Münchner Verkehrs  und Tarifverbund GmbH   The Munich tramway is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city  which has been in operation since 1876  Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines   The extensive network of subway and tram lines assist and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre  The 700m long Kaufinger Strasse  which starts near the Main train station  forms a pedestrian east west spine that traverses almost the entire centre  Similarly  Weinstrasse leads off northwards to the Hofgarten  These major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike  The transformation of the historic area into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable  safe and enjoyable  These attributes result from applying the principle of  filtered permability  which selectively restricts the number of roads that run through the centre  While certain streets are discontinuous for cars  they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre  In addition  these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip see image   The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts—the Fused Grid   The main railway station is Munich Hauptbahnhof  in the city centre  and there are two smaller main line stations at Pasing  in the west of the city  and Munich Ostbahnhof in the east  All three are connected to the public transport system and serve as transportation hubs   ICE highspeed trains stop at Munich Pasing and Munich Hauptbahnhof only  InterCity and EuroCity trains to destinations east of Munich also stop at Munich East  Since 28 May 2006 Munich has been connected to Nuremberg via Ingolstadt by the Nuremberg–Munich high speed railway line   The trade fair transport logistic is held every two years at the Neue Messe München  Messe München International    12 4  Individual transportation  Munich is an integral part of the motorway network of southern Germany  Motorways from Stuttgart  W   Nuremberg  Frankfurt and Berlin  N   Deggendorf and Passau  E   Salzburg and Innsbruck  SE   Garmisch Partenkirchen  S  and Lindau  SW  terminate at Munich  allowing direct access to the different parts of Germany  Austria and Italy   Traffic is however  often very heavy in and around Munich  Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour and at the beginning and end of major holidays in Germany  in no small part due to poor traffic light changing patterns and synchronisation  There are few  green waves  or roundabouts  Another contributing factor is the lack of a proper ring road  This mittlere Ring is a ring road in name only and is a loosely connected system of roads with many traffic light controlled junctions   12 5  Cycling  Cycling is recognised as a good alternative to motorised transport and the growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year  They are mostly not segregated from foot paths  making them dangerous to both parties  Many of the cycle path surfaces are of poor quality often due to the roots of roadside trees breaking through the tarmac  fortunately the roads themselves are seldom affected by these tree roots  The cycle paths usually involve a longer route than by the road as they are diverted around objects and the presence of pedestrians tends to make them quite slow   A modern bike hire system is available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring   13  Around Munich  The Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the Alpine foothills comprising about 2 6 million inhabitants  Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like Dachau  Freising  Erding  Starnberg  Landshut and Moosburg are today part of the Greater Munich Region  formed by Munich and the surrounding districts  making up the Munich Metropolitan Region  which has a population of about 4 5 million people  File StadtpfarrkircheStJakob JPG Dachau File Erding center JPG Erding File Dom freising jpg Freising File Cloister Fuerstenfeld Portal jpg Fürstenfeldbruck File Landsberg
