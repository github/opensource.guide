Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies the principles of engineering  physics and materials science for the design  analysis  manufacturing  and maintenance of mechanical systems  It is the branch of engineering that involves the design  production  and operation of machinery and tools  It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines   The engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics  kinematics  thermodynamics  materials science  structural analysis  and electricity  Mechanical engineers use these core principles along with tools like computer aided engineering  and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants  industrial equipment and machinery  heating and cooling systems  transport systems  aircraft  watercraft  robotics  medical devices  weapons  and others   Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the industrial revolution in Europe in the 18th century  however  its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world  Mechanical engineering science emerged in the 19th century as a result of developments in the field of physics  The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements in technology  and mechanical engineers today are pursuing developments in such fields as composites  mechatronics  and nanotechnology  Mechanical engineering overlaps with aerospace engineering  metallurgical engineering  civil engineering  electrical engineering  petroleum engineering  manufacturing engineering  chemical engineering  and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts  Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of Biomedical engineering  specifically with biomechanics  transport phenomena  biomechatronics  bionanotechnology and modeling of biological systems  like soft tissue mechanics   1  History  Mechanical engineering finds its application in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies throughout mankind  In ancient Greece  the works of Archimedes  287–212 BC  deeply influenced mechanics in the Western tradition and Heron of Alexandria  c  10–70 AD  created the first steam engine  Aeolipile   In China  Zhang Heng  78–139 AD  improved a water clock and invented a seismometer  and Ma Jun  200–265 AD  invented a chariot with differential gears  The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer Su Song  1020–1101 AD  incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock tower two centuries before any escapement can be found in clocks of medieval Europe  as well as the world s first known endless power transmitting chain drive   During the years from 7th to 15th century  the era called the Islamic Golden Age  there were remarkable contributions from Muslim inventors in the field of mechanical technology  Al Jazari  who was one of them  wrote his famous Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices in 1206  and presented many mechanical designs  He is also considered to be the inventor of such mechanical devices which now form the very basic of mechanisms  such as the crankshaft and camshaft   Important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in England during the 17th century when Sir Isaac Newton both formulated the three Newton s Laws of Motion and developed Calculus  the mathematical basis of physics  Newton was reluctant to publish his methods and laws for years  but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues  such as Sir Edmund Halley  much to the benefit of all mankind  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is also credited with creating Calculus during the same time frame   During the early 19th century in England  Germany and Scotland  the development of machine tools led mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering  providing manufacturing machines and the engines to power them  The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 Institution of Mechanical Engineers  thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society Institution of Civil Engineers  On the European continent  Johann von Zimmermann  1820–1901  founded the first factory for grinding machines in Chemnitz  Germany in 1848   In the United States  the American Society of Mechanical Engineers  ASME  was formed in 1880  becoming the third such professional engineering society  after the American Society of Civil Engineers  1852  and the American Institute of Mining Engineers  1871   The first schools in the United States to offer an engineering education were the United States Military Academy in 1817  an institution now known as Norwich University in 1819  and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1825  Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science   2  Education  Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide  In Brazil  Ireland  Philippines  Pakistan  China  Greece  Turkey  North America  South Asia  India  Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom  mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study and result in a Bachelor of Engineering  B Eng  or B E    Bachelor of Science  B Sc  or B S    Bachelor of Science Engineering  B Sc Eng    Bachelor of Technology  B Tech    Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering  B M E    or Bachelor of Applied Science  B A Sc   degree  in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering  In Spain  Portugal and most of South America  where neither B Sc  nor B Tech  programs have been adopted  the formal name for the degree is  Mechanical Engineer   and the course work is based on five or six years of training  In Italy the course work is based on five years of training  but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam at the end of the course  In Greece  the coursework is based on a five year curriculum and the requirement of a  Diploma  Thesis  which upon completion a  Diploma  is awarded rather than a B Sc   In Australia  mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as Bachelor of Engineering  Mechanical  or similar nomenclature although there are an increasing number of specialisations  The degree takes four years of full time study to achieve  To ensure quality in engineering degrees  Engineers Australia accredits engineering degrees awarded by Australian universities in accordance with the global Washington Accord  Before the degree can be awarded  the student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an engineering firm  Similar systems are also present in South Africa and are overseen by the Engineering Council of South Africa  ECSA    In the United States  most undergraduate mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology  ABET  to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities  The ABET web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 March 2014  Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board  CEAB   and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies   Some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering  Master of Technology  Master of Science  Master of Engineering Management  M Eng Mgt  or M E M    a Doctor of Philosophy in engineering  Eng D  or Ph D   or an engineer s degree  The master s and engineer s degrees may or may not include research  The Doctor of Philosophy includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia  The Engineer s degree exists at a few institutions at an intermediate level between the master s degree and the doctorate   2 1  Coursework  Standards set by each country s accreditation society are intended to provide uniformity in fundamental subject material  promote competence among graduating engineers  and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole  Engineering programs in the U S   for example  are required by ABET to show that their students can  work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas   The specific courses required to graduate  however  may differ from program to program  Universities and Institutes of technology will often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into multiple classes  depending on the faculty available and the university s major area s  of research   The fundamental subjects of mechanical engineering usually include   Mathematics  in particular  calculus  differential equations  and linear algebra   Basic physical sciences  including physics and chemistry   Statics and dynamics  Strength of materials and solid mechanics  Materials Engineering  Composites  Thermodynamics  heat transfer  energy conversion  and HVAC  Fuels  combustion  Internal combustion engine  Fluid mechanics  including fluid statics and fluid dynamics   Mechanism and Machine design  including kinematics and dynamics   Instrumentation and measurement  Manufacturing engineering  technology  or processes  Vibration  control theory and control engineering  Hydraulics  and pneumatics  Mechatronics  and robotics  Engineering design and product design  Drafting  computer aided design  CAD  and computer aided manufacturing  CAM  Mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic concepts from chemistry  physics  chemical engineering  civil engineering  and electrical engineering  All mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including calculus  and advanced mathematical concepts including differential equations  partial differential equations  linear algebra  abstract algebra  and differential geometry  among others   In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum  many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes  such as control systems  robotics  transport and logistics  cryogenics  fuel technology  automotive engineering  biomechanics  vibration  optics and others  if a separate department does not exist for these subjects   Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem solving experience  In the United States it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one or more internships while studying  though this is not typically mandated by the university  Cooperative education is another option  Future work skills research puts demand on study components that feed student s creativity and innovation   2 2  License  Engineers may seek license by a state  provincial  or national government  The purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge  real world experience  and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level  Once certified  the engineer is given the title of Professional Engineer  in the United States  Canada  Japan  South Korea  Bangladesh and South Africa   Chartered Engineer  in the United Kingdom  Ireland  India and Zimbabwe   Chartered Professional Engineer  in Australia and New Zealand  or European Engineer  much of the European Union   Registered Engineer or Professional Engineer in Philippines and Pakistan  The Chartered Engineer and European Engineer are not licenses to practice   they are qualifications   In the U S   to become a licensed Professional Engineer  PE   an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE  Fundamentals of Engineering  exam  work a minimum of 4 years as an Engineering Intern  EI  or Engineer in Training  EIT   and pass the  Principles and Practice  or PE  Practicing Engineer or Professional Engineer  exams  The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying  NCEES   a composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all U S  states and territories   In the UK  current graduates require a BEng plus an appropriate masters degree or an integrated MEng degree  a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development  and a peer reviewed project report in the candidates specialty area in order to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer  CEng  MIMechE  through the Institution of Mechanical Engineers  CEng MIMechE can also be obtained via an examination route through the City and Guilds of London Institute   In most developed countries  certain engineering tasks  such as the design of bridges  electric power plants  and chemical plants  must be approved by a Professional Engineer or a Chartered Engineer   Only a licensed engineer  for instance  may prepare  sign  seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval  or to seal engineering work for public and private clients   This requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation  such as in the Canadian provinces  for example the Ontario or Quebec s Engineer Act   In other countries  such as Australia  and the UK  no such legislation exists  however  practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics independent of legislation  that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion   3  Salaries and workforce statistics  The total number of engineers employed in the U S  in 2009 was roughly 1 6 million  Of these  239 000 were mechanical engineers  14 9%   the second largest discipline by size behind civil  278 000   The total number of mechanical engineering jobs in 2009 was projected to grow 6% over the next decade  with average starting salaries being $58 800 with a bachelor s degree  The median annual income of mechanical engineers in the U S  workforce was $80 580  The median income was highest when working for the government  $92 030   and lowest in education  $57 090  as of 2012   4  Modern tools  Many mechanical engineering companies  especially those in industrialized nations  have begun to incorporate computer aided engineering  CAE  programs into their existing design and analysis processes  including 2D and 3D solid modeling computer aided design  CAD   This method has many benefits  including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products  the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts  and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances   Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include product lifecycle management  PLM  tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations  Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads  including fatigue life and manufacturability  These tools include finite element analysis  FEA   computational fluid dynamics  CFD   and computer aided manufacturing  CAM    Using CAE programs  a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost  performance  and other constraints  No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion  allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated  instead of a relative few  In addition  CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand  such as viscoelasticity  complex contact between mating parts  or non Newtonian flows   As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines  as seen in mechatronics  multidisciplinary design optimization  MDO  is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process  MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes  allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day  They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs  often finding better  innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems   5  Subdisciplines  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines  Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below  with a brief explanation and the most common application of each  Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering  while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines  Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines  as well as specialized subdisciplines  Specialized subdisciplines  as used in this article  are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on the job training than undergraduate research  Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section   5 1  Mechanics  Mechanics is  in the most general sense  the study of forces and their effect upon matter  Typically  engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation  both elastic and plastic  of objects under known forces  also called loads  or stresses  Subdisciplines of mechanics include  Statics  the study of non moving bodies under known loads  how forces affect static bodies  Dynamics  or kinetics   the study of how forces affect moving bodies  Mechanics of materials  the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress  Fluid mechanics  the study of how fluids react to forces  Kinematics  the study of the motion of bodies  objects  and systems  groups of objects   while ignoring the forces that cause the motion  Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms   Continuum mechanics  a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous  rather than discrete  Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering  If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle  statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle  in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense  Dynamics might be used when designing the car s engine  to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles  Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine  Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle  see HVAC   or to design the intake system for the engine   5 2  Mechatronics and robotics  Mechatronics is the combination of mechanics and electronics  It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering  electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems  In this way  machines can be automated through the use of electric motors  servo mechanisms  and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software  A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD ROM drive  Mechanical systems open and close the drive  spin the CD and move the laser  while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits  Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer   Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots  which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous  unpleasant  or repetitive  These robots may be of any shape and size  but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world  To create a robot  an engineer typically employs kinematics  to determine the robot s range of motion  and mechanics  to determine the stresses within the robot    Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering  They allow businesses to save money on labor  perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically  and to ensure better quality  Many companies employ assembly lines of robots especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves  Outside the factory  robots have been employed in bomb disposal  space exploration  and many other fields  Robots are also sold for various residential applications  from recreation to domestic applications   5 3  Structural analysis  Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering  and also civil engineering  devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance  Structural failures occur in two general modes  static failure  and fatigue failure  Static structural failure occurs when  upon being loaded  having a force applied  the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically  depending on the criterion for failure  Fatigue failure occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles  Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object  a microscopic crack on the surface of the object  for instance  will grow slightly with each cycle  propagation  until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure   Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks  however  it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended  Some systems  such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags  are designed to break  If these systems do not break  failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause   Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred  or when designing to prevent failure  Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes   Structural analysis may be used in the office when designing parts  in the field to analyze failed parts  or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests   5 4  Thermodynamics and thermo science  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering  including mechanical and chemical engineering  At its simplest  thermodynamics is the study of energy  its use and transformation through a system  Typically  engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another  As an example  automotive engines convert chemical energy  enthalpy  from the fuel into heat  and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels   Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer  thermofluids  and energy conversion  Mechanical engineers use thermo science to design engines and power plants  heating  ventilation  and air conditioning  HVAC  systems  heat exchangers  heat sinks  radiators  refrigeration  insulation  and others   5 5  Design and drafting  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts  A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part  as well as assembly notes  a list of required materials  and other pertinent information  A U S  mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman  Drafting has historically been a two dimensional process  but computer aided design  CAD  programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions   Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery  either manually  through programmed instructions  or through the use of a computer aided manufacturing  CAM  or combined CAD CAM program  Optionally  an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings  but this is becoming an increasing rarity  with the advent of computer numerically controlled  CNC  manufacturing  Engineers primarily manually manufacture parts in the areas of applied spray coatings  finishes  and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine   Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering  and by many other branches of engineering and architecture  Three dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis  FEA  and computational fluid dynamics  CFD    6  Frontiers of research  Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer  cheaper  and more efficient machines and mechanical systems  Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below  see also exploratory engineering    6 1  Micro electro mechanical systems  MEMS   Micron scale mechanical components such as springs  gears  fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon  glass and polymers like SU8  Examples of MEMS components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors  modern cell phones  gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications   6 2  Friction stir welding  FSW   Friction stir welding  a new type of welding  was discovered in 1991 by The Welding Institute  TWI   The innovative steady state  non fusion  welding technique joins materials previously un weldable  including several aluminum alloys  It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes  potentially replacing rivets  Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank  Orion Crew Vehicle test article  Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket  armor plating for amphibious assault ships  and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses   6 3  Composites  Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately  Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing  and  subsequently  finding applications for  stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight  susceptibility to corrosion  and other undesirable factors  Carbon fiber reinforced composites  for instance  have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods   6 4  Mechatronics  Mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering  electronic engineering  and software engineering  The purpose of this interdisciplinary engineering field is the study of automation from an engineering perspective and serves the purposes of controlling advanced hybrid systems   6 5  Nanotechnology  At the smallest scales  mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology —one speculative goal of which is to create a molecular assembler to build molecules and materials via mechanosynthesis  For now that goal remains within exploratory engineering  Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters  nanofilms  and nanostructures  among others   6 6  Finite element analysis  This field is not new  as the basis of Finite Element Analysis  FEA  or Finite Element Method  FEM  dates back to 1941  But evolution of computers has made FEA FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems  Many commercial codes such as ANSYS  Nastran and ABAQUS are widely used in industry for research and design of components  Calculix is an open source and free finite element program  Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules   Other techniques such as finite difference method  FDM  and finite volume method  FVM  are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer  fluid flows  fluid surface interaction etc   6 7  Biomechanics  Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems  such as humans  animals  plants  organs  and cells  Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans   Biomechanics is closely related to engineering  because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyse biological systems  Some simple applications of Newtonian mechanics and or materials sciences can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems   Over the past decade the Finite element method  FEM  has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics  FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to in vivo surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia  The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo anatomical response of an anatomy  without being subject to ethical restrictions  This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy  e g  BioSpine    6 8  Computational fluid dynamics  Computational fluid dynamics  usually abbreviated as CFD  is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions  With high speed supercomputers  better solutions can be achieved  Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows  Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full scale testing  e g  flight tests   6 9  Acoustical engineering  Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics  Acoustical engineering is the study of Sound and Vibration  These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise  The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid  microphone  headphone  or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall  Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems   7  Related fields  Manufacturing engineering  Aerospace engineering and Automotive engineering are sometimes grouped with mechanical engineering  A bachelor s degree in these areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes   8  See also   Lists  List of historic mechanical engineering landmarks  List of inventors  List of mechanical engineering
