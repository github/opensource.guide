Wicca    is a modern pagan  witchcraft religion  It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner  a retired British civil servant  It draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice  The word witch derives from Middle English wicche  Old English wicce     feminine   witch  and wicca     masculine   wizard    Wicca is a diverse religion with no central authority or figure defining it  It is divided into various lineages and denominations  referred to as traditions  each with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation  Due to its decentralized nature  there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca  Some traditions  collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca  strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term Wicca to apply only to such lineaged traditions  while other eclectic traditions do not   Wicca is typically duotheistic  worshipping a god and goddess traditionally viewed as a mother goddess and horned god  These two deities are sometimes viewed as facets of a greater pantheistic godhead  However  beliefs range from hard polytheism to even monotheism  Wiccan celebration follows approximately eight seasonally based festivals known as Sabbats  An unattributed statement known as the Wiccan Rede is the traditional basis of Wiccan morality  Wicca often involves the ritual practice of magic  though it is not always necessary   1  Terminology  The term Wicca first achieved widespread acceptance when referring to the religion in the 1960s and 70s  Prior to that  the term Witchcraft had been more widely used  Whilst being based upon the Old English word wicca  a masculine term for sorcerers  the actual individual who coined the capitalised term Wicca is unknown  though it has been speculated that it was Charles Cardell  who certainly used the term Wiccen during the 1950s   Application of the word Wicca has given rise to  a great deal of disagreement and infighting   Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca are often collectively termed British Traditional Wicca  and many of their practitioners consider the term Wicca to apply only to these lineaged traditions  Others do not use the word Wicca at all  instead preferring to be referred to only as Witchcraft  while others believe that all modern witchcraft traditions can be considered Wiccan   Popular culture  as seen in television programs such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer  tends to use the terms Wiccan and Wicca as completely synonymous with the terms Witch and Witchcraft respectively   2  Beliefs  Beliefs vary markedly between different traditions and individual practitioners  However  various commonalities exist between these disparate groups  which usually include views on theology  the afterlife  magic and morality   2 1  Theology  Wiccan views on theology are numerous and varied and there is no universally agreed upon religious canon  but Wicca is traditionally a duotheistic religion that venerates both a Triple Goddess associated with the moon  stars  and often the Earth  and a Horned God associated with the sun  forests and animals  These two deities are variously understood through the frameworks of pantheism  as being dual aspects of a single godhead   duotheism  as being two polar opposites   hard polytheism  being two distinct deities in a larger pantheon which includes other pagan gods  or soft polytheism  being composed of many lesser deities   In some pantheistic and duotheistic conceptions  deities from diverse cultures may be seen as aspects of the Goddess or God  However  there are also other theological viewpoints to be found within the Craft  including monotheism  the concept that there is just one deity  which is seen by some  such as Dianic Wiccans  as being the Goddess  whilst by others  like the Church and School of Wicca  as instead being genderless  There are other Wiccans who are atheists or agnostics  not believing in any actual deity  but instead viewing the gods as psychological archetypes of the human mind which can be evoked and interacted with   According to the Witches Janet and Stewart Farrar  who held a pantheistic  duotheistic and animistic view of theology  Wiccans  regard the whole cosmos as alive  both as a whole and in all of its parts   but that  such an organic view of the cosmos cannot be fully expressed  and lived  without the concept of the God and Goddess  There is no manifestation without polarisation  so at the highest creative level  that of Divinity  the polarisation must be the clearest and most powerful of all  reflecting and spreading itself through all the microcosmic levels as well    2 2  Duotheism  Wicca is traditionally and primarily a religion centred upon the idea of gender polarity and the worship of a Moon Goddess and a Horned God   This core theology was originally described by Gerald Gardner  the founder of the religion  and Doreen Valiente  who wrote much of the original liturgical materials   The Goddess and the God may be regarded as the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine  They are complementary opposites or dualities  bearing similarities to the concept of yin and yang in Taoism  The God and Goddess are generally seen as lovers and equals  the Divine Couple who together co create the cosmos   2 2 1  The God and the Goddess  For most Wiccans  the God and Goddess are seen as complementary polarities in the universe that balance one another out  and in this manner they have been compared to the concept of yin and yang found in Taoism  As such they are often interpreted as being  embodiments of a life force manifest in nature  with some Wiccans believing that they are simply symbolic of these polarities  whilst others believing that the God and the Goddess are genuine beings that exist independently  The two divinities are often given symbolic associations  with the Goddess commonly being symbolised as the Earth  i e  Mother Earth   but also sometimes as the Moon  which complements the God being viewed as the Sun   Traditionally the God is viewed as a Horned God  associated with nature  wilderness  sexuality  hunting and the life cycle  The Horned God is given various names according to the tradition  and these include Cernunnos  Pan  Atho and Karnayna   At other times the God is viewed as the Green Man  a traditional figure in European art and architecture  and they often interpret him as being associated with the natural world  The God is also often depicted as a Sun God particularly at the festival of Litha  or the summer solstice  Another expression of the God is that of the Oak King and the Holly King  one who rules over winter and spring  the other who rules over summer and autumn  He has also been seen in the roles of the Leader of the Wild Hunt and the Lord of Death   The Goddess is usually portrayed as a Triple Goddess  thereby being a triadic deity comprising a Maiden goddess  a Mother goddess  and a Crone goddess  each of whom has different associations  namely virginity  fertility and wisdom  She is also commonly depicted as a Moon Goddess  and is often given the name of Diana after the ancient Roman deity  Some Wiccans  particularly from the 1970s onwards  have viewed the Goddess as the more important of the two deities  who is pre eminent in that she contains and conceives all  In this respect  the God is viewed as the spark of life and inspiration within her  simultaneously her lover and her child  This is reflected in the traditional structure of the coven  In one monotheistic form of the Craft  Dianic Wicca  the Goddess is the sole deity  a concept that has been criticised by members of other more egalitarian traditions   According to Gerald Gardner   the Goddess  is a deity of prime importance  along with her consort the Horned God  In the earliest Wiccan publications  she is described as a tribal goddess of the witch community  neither omnipotent nor universal  and it was recognised that there was a greater  Prime Mover   although the witches did not concern themselves much with this being   The concept of having a religion venerating a Horned God accompanying a goddess had been devised by the Egyptologist Margaret Murray during the 1920s  She believed  based upon her own theories about the early modern witch trials in Europe  that those two deities  though primarily the Horned God  had been worshipped by a Witch Cult ever since western Europe had succumbed to Christianity  Whilst now widely discredited  Gerald Gardner was a supporter of her theory  and believed that Wicca was a continuation of that historical Witch Cult  and that the Horned God and Goddess were therefore ancient deities of the British Isles  Modern scholarship has disproved his claims  however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early medieval periods   2 2 2  Pantheism  polytheism and animism  Many Wiccans believe that the God and Goddess are merely two aspects of the same godhead  often viewed as a pantheistic deity  thereby encompassing everything in the universe within its divinity  In his public writings  Gardner referred to this being as the Prime Mover  and claimed that it remained unknowable  although in the rituals of his tradition  Gardnerianism  it is referred to as Dryghten  which had originally been an Old English term meaning The Lord  Since then it has been given other names by different Wiccans  for instance Scott Cunningham called it by its name in neoplatonism  The One  Other Wiccans such as Starhawk use the term Star Goddess to describe the universal pantheistic deity that created the cosmos  and regard her as a knowable deity that can and should be worshipped   As well as pantheism and duotheism  many Wiccans accept the concept of polytheism  thereby believing that there are many different deities  Some accept the view espoused by the occultist Dion Fortune that  all gods are one god  and all goddesses are one goddess  – that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are  respectively  aspects of one supernal God and Goddess  With this mindset  a Wiccan may regard the Germanic Ēostre  Hindu Kali  and Christian Virgin Mary each as manifestations of one supreme Goddess and likewise  the Celtic Cernunnos  the ancient Greek Dionysus and the Judeo Christian Yahweh as aspects of a single  archetypal god  A more strictly polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right  The Wiccan writers Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures  tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview  Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms  thereby technically allowing them to be atheists  Such a view was purported by the High Priestess Vivianne Crowley  herself a psychologist  who considered the Wiccan deities to be Jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual  It was for this reason that she said that  The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision    Wicca is essentially an immanent religion  and for some Wiccans  this idea also involves elements of animism  A belief central to Wicca is that the Goddess and the God  or the goddesses and gods  are able to manifest in personal form  most importantly through the bodies of Priestesses and Priests via the rituals of Drawing down the Moon or Drawing down the Sun   2 3  Afterlife  Belief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans  although reincarnation is a traditional Wiccan teaching dating back to the New Forest coven in the 1930s  The influential High Priest Raymond Buckland said that a human s soul reincarnates into the same species over many lives in order to learn lessons and advance spiritually  but this belief is not universal  as many Wiccans believe in the reincarnation of the soul through different species  However  a popular saying amongst Wiccans is that  once a witch  always a witch   indicating a belief that Wiccans are the reincarnations of previous witches   Typically  Wiccans who believe in reincarnation believe that the soul rests between lives in the Otherworld or Summerland  known in Gardner s writings as the  ecstasy of the Goddess   Many Wiccans believe in the ability to contact the spirits of the dead who reside in the Otherworld through spirit mediums and Ouija boards  particularly on the Sabbat of Samhain  though some disagree with this practice  such as the late Alexandrian High Priest Alex Sanders  who stated that  they are dead  leave them in peace   This belief was likely influenced by Spiritualism  which was very popular at the time of Wicca s emergence  and with which Gardner and other early Wiccans such as Buckland and Sanders had some experience   Despite some belief therein  Wicca does not place an emphasis on the afterlife  focusing instead on the current one  as the historian Ronald Hutton remarked   the instinctual position of most  Wiccans   therefore  seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life  in all respects  then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process  and so one may as well concentrate on the present    2 4  Magic  Many Wiccans believe in magic  a manipulative force exercised through the practice of witchcraft or sorcery  Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by ceremonial magicians  such as Aleister Crowley  who declared that magic was  the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will   while another prominent ceremonial magician  MacGregor Mathers stated that it was  the science of the control of the secret forces of nature   Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature  as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science  and as such they do not view it as being supernatural  but a part of what Leo Martello calls the  super powers that reside in the natural   Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses in order to achieve surprising results  whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works  merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so  Some spell it  magick   a variation coined by the influential occultist Aleister Crowley  though this spelling is more commonly associated with Crowley s religion of Thelema than with Wicca   During ritual practices  which are often staged in a sacred circle  Wiccans cast spells or  workings  intended to bring about real changes in the physical world  Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing  for protection  fertility  or to banish negative influences  Many early Wiccans  such as Alex Sanders  Sybil Leek and Doreen Valiente  referred to their own magic as  white magic   which contrasted with  black magic   which they associated with evil and Satanism  Sanders also used the similar terminology of  left hand path  to describe malevolent magic  and  right hand path  to describe magic performed with good intentions  terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century  Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white black magic and left right hand path dichotomies  arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil   Scholars of religion Rodney Stark and William Bainbridge claimed in 1985 that Wicca had  reacted to secularisation by a headlong plunge back into magic  and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out  This view was heavily criticised in 1999 by the historian Ronald Hutton who claimed that the evidence displayed the very opposite  that  a large number  of Wiccans  were in jobs at the cutting edge  of scientific culture   such as computer technology    2 5  Morality  There exists no dogmatic moral or ethical code followed universally by Wiccans of all traditions  however a majority follow a code known as the Wiccan Rede  which states  an it harm none  do what ye will   a variation of the Thelemic abjuration put forward by Aleister Crowley   Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law  Love is the Law  Love under Will    This is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act  along with the necessity of taking responsibility for what follows from one s actions and minimising harm to oneself and others  Another common element of Wiccan morality is the Law of Threefold Return which holds that whatever benevolent or malevolent actions a person performs will return to that person with triple force  or with equal force on each of the three levels of body  mind and spirit  similar to the eastern idea of karma  The Wiccan Rede was introduced into Wicca by Gerald Gardner and formalised publicly by Doreen Valiente  one of his High Priestesses  The Threefold Law was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual  made by Monique Wilson and further popularised by Raymond Buckland  in his books on Wicca   Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente s Charge of the Goddess  these being mirth  reverence  honour  humility  strength  beauty  power  and compassion  In Valiente s poem  they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites  reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy  Some lineaged Wiccans also observe a set of Wiccan Laws  commonly called the Craft Laws or Ardanes  30 of which exist in the Gardnerian tradition and 161 of which are in the Alexandrian tradition  Valiente  one of Gardner s original High Priestesses  argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock archaic language as the by product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven – the others were later additions made by Alex Sanders during the 1960s   Although Gerald Gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to homosexuality  claiming that it brought down  the curse of the goddess   it is now generally accepted in all traditions of Wicca  with certain groups like the Minoan Brotherhood openly crafting their philosophy around it  and various important figures in the Craft  such as Alex Sanders and Eddie Buczynski  being openly homosexual or bisexual   2 6  Five elements  Many traditions hold a belief in the five classical elements  although they are seen as symbolic as representations of the phases of matter  These five elements are invoked during many magical rituals  notably when consecrating a magic circle  The five elements are air  fire  water and earth  plus aether  or spirit   which unites the other four  Various analogies have been devised to explain the concept of the five elements  for instance  the Wiccan Ann Marie Gallagher used that of a tree  which is composed of earth  with the soil and plant matter   water  sap and moisture   fire  through photosynthesis  and air  the creation of oxygen from carbon dioxide   all of which are believed to be united through spirit   Traditionally in the Gardnerian Craft  each element has been associated with a cardinal point of the compass  air with east  fire with south  water with west  earth with north and the spirit with centre  However  some Wiccans  such as Frederic Lamond  have claimed that the set cardinal points are only those applicable to the geography of southern England  where Wicca evolved  and that Wiccans should determine which directions best suit each element in their region  for instance  those living on the east coast of North America should invoke water in the east and not the west because the colossal body of water  the Atlantic ocean  is to their east  Other Craft groups have associated the elements with different cardinal points  for instance Robert Cochrane s Clan of Tubal Cain associated earth with south  fire with east  water with west and air with north  and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary Horned God and Goddess  The five elements are symbolised by the five points of the pentagram  the most prominently used symbol of Wicca   2 7  Natural cycles  The natural cycles are significant in Wicca  The lunar and solar cycles are most often the basis around which Wiccans place ritual celebrations  While both the God and the Goddess are usually honoured at both kinds of rituals  the Goddess is mainly associated with the Moon  and the God is mainly associated with the Sun   3  Practices  The Neopagan researcher and High Priestess Margot Adler  who defined ritual as being  one method of reintegrating individuals and groups into the cosmos  and to tie in the activities of daily life with their ever present  often forgotten  significance  noted that rituals  celebrations and rites of passage in Wicca are not  dry  formalised  repetitive experiences   but are performed with the purpose of inducing a religious experience in the participants  thereby altering their consciousness  She noted that many Wiccans remain sceptical about the existence of the gods  afterlife etc but remain involved in the Craft because of its ritual experiences  with one  Glenna Turner  saying that  I love myth  dream  visionary art  The Craft is a place where all of these things fit together – beauty  pageantry  music  dance  song  dream    The High Priest and Craft historian Aidan Kelly claimed that the practices and experiences within Wicca were actually far more important than the beliefs  stating that  it s a religion of ritual rather than theology  The ritual is first  the myth is second  And taking an attitude that the myths of the Craft are  true history  in the way a fundamentalist looks at the legends of Genesis really seems crazy  It s an alien head space   Similarly  Adler stated that  ironically  considering the many pronouncements against Witchcraft as a threat to reason  the Craft is one of the few religious viewpoints totally compatible with modern science  allowing total scepticism about even its own methods  myths and rituals    3 1  Ritual practices  The practice of Wicca often involves the ritual practice of magic  ranging from the  low magic  or  folk magic  of shamanism and witchcraft to more elaborate and complex rites influenced by the ceremonial magic of the Western Hermetic Tradition   There are many rituals within Wicca that are used when celebrating the Sabbats  worshipping the deities and working magic  Often these take place on a full moon  or in some cases a new moon  which is known as an Esbat  In typical rites  the coven or solitary assembles inside a ritually cast and purified magic circle  Casting the circle may involve the invocation of the  Guardians  of the cardinal points  alongside their respective classical elements  air  fire  water and earth  Once the circle is cast  a seasonal ritual may be performed  prayers to the God and Goddess are said  and spells are sometimes worked  these may include various forms of  raising energy   including raising a cone of power for the purposes of sending healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space  These rites often include a special set of magical tools  These usually include a knife called an athame  a wand  a pentacle and a chalice  but other tools include a broomstick known as a besom  a cauldron  candles  incense and a curved blade known as a boline  An altar is usually present in the circle  on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the God and the Goddess may be displayed  Before entering the circle  some traditions fast for the day  and or ritually bathe  After a ritual has finished  the God  Goddess and Guardians are thanked  the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed   A central aspect of Wicca  particularly in Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca   often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude  also known as skyclad  This practice seemingly derives from a line in Aradia  Charles Leland s supposed record of Italian witchcraft  Other traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes  In certain traditions  ritualised sex magic is performed in the form of the Great Rite  whereby a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess to possess them before performing sexual intercourse to raise magical energy for use in spellwork  In nearly all cases it is instead performed  in token   thereby merely symbolically  using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb   One of Wicca s best known liturgical texts is  The Charge of the Goddess   The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of Doreen Valiente  who developed it from Gardner s version  Gardner s wording of the original  Charge  added extracts from the works of Aleister Crowley s work  including The Book of the Law   especially from Ch 1  spoken by Nuit  the Star Goddess  thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the revelations of Thelema  Valiente rewrote Gardner s version in verse  keeping the material derived from Aradia  but removing the material from Crowley   3 2  Wheel of the Year  Wiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year  commonly known as Sabbats  Collectively  these occasions are termed the Wheel of the Year  Most Wiccans celebrate a set of eight of these Sabbats  however  other groups such as those associated with the Clan of Tubal Cain only follow four  In the rare case of the Ros an Bucca group from Cornwall  only six are adhered to  The four Sabbats that are common to all British derived groups are the cross quarter days  sometimes referred to as Greater Sabbats  The names of these festivals are in some cases taken from the Old Irish fire festivals  though in most traditional Wiccan covens the only commonality with the Celtic festival is the name  Gardner himself made use of the English names of these holidays  stating that  the four great Sabbats are Candlemass  May Eve  Lammas  and Halloween  the equinoxes and solstices are celebrated also   In the Egyptologist Margaret Murray s The Witch Cult in Western Europe  1921  and The God of the Witches  1933   in which she dealt with what she believed to be a historical Witch Cult  she stated that the four main festivals had survived Christianisation and had been celebrated in the pagan Witchcraft religion  Subsequently  when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s  many of the early groups  such as Robert Cochrane s Clan of Tubal Cain and Gerald Gardner s Bricket Wood coven adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray   The other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as Lesser Sabbats  and comprise the solstices and the equinoxes  and were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven  before subsequently being adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition  and eventually other traditions like Alexandrian Wicca and the Dianic tradition  The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from Germanic pagan holidays  However  the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts  instead exhibiting a form of universalism  Rituals observed may display cultural influence from the holidays from which they take their name as well as influence from other unrelated cultures   3 3  Rites of passage  Various rites of passage can be found within Wicca  Perhaps the most significant of these is an initiation ritual  through which somebody joins the Craft and becomes a Wiccan  In British Traditional Wiccan  BTW  traditions  there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to Gerald Gardner  and from him is said to go back to the New Forest coven  however  the existence of this coven remains unproven  Gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of  a year and a day  between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated  although he frequently broke this rule with initiates   In BTW  initiation only accepts someone into the first degree  To proceed to the second degree  an initiate has to go through another ceremony  in which they name and describe the uses of the ritual tools and implements  It is also at this ceremony that they are given their craft name  By holding the rank of second degree  a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft  or founding their own semi autonomous covens  The third degree is the highest in BTW  and it involves the participation of the Great Rite  either actual or symbolically  and in some cases ritual flagellation  which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado masochistic overtones  By holding this rank  an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven   According to new age religious scholar James R  Lewis  in his book Witchcraft today  an encyclopaedia of Wiccan and neopagan traditions  a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third degree high priestess  in the orthodox Gardnerian system   She then becomes eligible to wear the  moon crown   The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage  and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of  lineage papers  proving the authenticity of her status   This three tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to BTW  and traditions heavily based upon it  The Cochranian tradition  which is not BTW  but based upon the teachings of Robert Cochrane  does not have the three degrees of initiation  merely having the stages of novice and initiate   Some solitary Wiccans also perform self initiation rituals  to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan  The first of these to be published was in Paul Huson s Mastering Witchcraft  1970   and unusually involved recitation of the Lord s Prayer backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical Witch Hunt  Subsequent  more overtly pagan self initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like Doreen Valiente  Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf   Handfasting is another celebration held by Wiccans  and is the commonly used term for their weddings  Some Wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day  which some traditions hold should be contracted on the Sabbat of Lughnasadh  as this was the traditional time for trial   Telltown marriages  among the Irish  A common marriage vow in Wicca is  for as long as love lasts  instead of the traditional Christian  till death do us part   The first known Wiccan wedding ceremony took part in 1960 amongst the Bricket Wood coven  between Frederic Lamond and his first wife  Gillian   Infants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a Wiccaning  which is analogous to a Christening  The purpose of this is to present the infant to the God and Goddess for protection  Parents are advised to  give children the gift of Wicca  in a manner suitable to their age  In accordance with the importance put on free will in Wicca  the child is not expected or required to adhere to Wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they reach adulthood   3 4  Book of Shadows  In Wicca  there is no set sacred text such as the Christian Bible  Jewish Tanakh or Islamic Quran  although there are certain scriptures and texts that various traditions hold to be important and influence their beliefs and practices  Gerald Gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens  known as the Book of Shadows  among other names   which he would frequently add to and adapt  In his Book of Shadows  there are texts taken from various sources  including Charles Godfrey Leland s Aradia  or the Gospel of the Witches  1899  and the works of 19th–20th century occultist Aleister Crowley  whom Gardner knew personally  Also in the Book are examples of poetry largely composed by Gardner and his High Priestess Doreen Valiente  the most notable of which is the Charge of the Goddess   Similar in use to the grimoires of ceremonial magicians  the Book contained instructions for how to perform rituals and spells  as well as religious poetry and chants like Eko Eko Azarak to use in those rituals  Gardner s original intention was that every copy of the Book would be different  because a student would copy from their initiators  but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective  however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today  particularly in the United States  all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner  with nothing being altered  The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non initiates into BTW  but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell  Lady Sheba  Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar   Today  adherents of many non BTW traditions have also adopted the concept of the Book of Shadows  with many solitaries also keeping their own versions  sometimes including material taken from the published Gardnerian Book of Shadows  In other traditions however  practices are never written down  meaning that there is no need for a Book of Shadows   In certain Traditional Witchcraft traditions  different forms of literature are used  for instance in the 1734 Tradition  the published articles of Robert Cochrane along with letters he wrote to Joseph Wilson  Robert Graves and others are held in high esteem whilst in the Sabbatic tradition  various grimoires are followed  such as the Azoetia of Andrew Chumbley   4  Traditions  In the 1950s through to the 1970s  when the Wiccan movement was largely confined to lineaged groups such as Gardnerian Wicca  a  tradition  usually implied the transfer of a lineage by initiation  However  with the rise of more and more such groups  often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage  the term came to be a synonym for a religious denomination within Wicca  There are many such traditions and there are also many solitary practitioners who do not align themselves with any particular lineage  working alone  There are also covens that have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition  instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically   Those traditions which trace a line of initiatory descent back to Gerald Gardner include Gardnerian Wicca  Alexandrian Wicca and the Algard tradition  because of their joint history  they are often referred to as British Traditional Wicca  particularly in North America  Other traditions trace their origins to different figures  even if their beliefs and practices have been influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Gardner  These include Cochrane s Craft and the 1734 Tradition  both of which trace their origins to Robert Cochrane  Feri  which traces itself back to Victor Anderson and Gwydion Pendderwen  and Dianic Wicca  whose followers often trace their influences back to Zsuzsanna Budapest  Some of these groups prefer to refer to themselves as Witches  thereby distinguishing themselves from the BTW traditions  who more typically use the term Wiccan  see Etymology    Many traditions  including those of British Traditional Wicca  require formal initiation within an established coven for membership of their respective traditions  In this manner  all BTW s can trace a direct line of descent all the way back to Gardner  Other traditions  however  do not hold this to be necessary   4 1  Covens  Lineaged Wicca is organised into covens of initiated priests and priestesses  Covens are autonomous  and are generally headed by a High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership  being a couple who have each been through their first  second and third degrees of initiation  Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second degree initiates  in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven  Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment  but this is not a necessity  and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven   A commonly quoted Wiccan tradition holds that the ideal number of members for a coven is thirteen  though this is not held as a hard and fast rule  Indeed  many U S  covens are far smaller  though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated Wiccans at  open  rituals  When covens grow beyond their ideal number of members  they often split  or  hive   into multiple covens  yet remain connected as a group  A grouping of multiple covens is known as a grove in many traditions   Initiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day  A course of study may be set during this period  In some covens a  dedication  ceremony may be performed during this period  some time before the initiation proper  allowing the person to attend certain rituals on a probationary basis  Some solitary Wiccans also choose to study for a year and a day before their self dedication to the religion   4 2  Eclectic Wicca  A large number of Wiccans do not exclusively follow any single tradition  These eclectic Wiccans each create their own syncretic spiritual paths by adopting and reinventing the beliefs and rituals of a variety of religious traditions connected to Wicca and broader Paganism   While the origins of modern Wiccan practice lie in covenantal activity of select few initiates in established lineages  eclectic Wiccans are more often than not solitary practitioners uninitiated in any tradition  A widening public appetite  especially in the United States  made traditional initiation unable to satisfy demand for involvement in Wicca  Since the 1970s  larger  more informal  often publicly advertised camps and workshops began to take place  This less formal but more accessible form of Wicca proved successful  Eclectic Wicca is the most popular variety of Wicca in America and eclectics now significantly outnumber lineaged Wiccans   Eclectic Wicca is not necessarily the complete abandonment of tradition  Eclectic practitioners may follow their own individual ideas and ritual practices  while still drawing on one or more religious or philosophical paths  Eclectic approaches to Wicca often draw on Earth religion and ancient Egyptian  Greek  Saxon  Anglo Saxon  Celtic  Asian  Jewish  and Polynesian traditions   5  History  5 1  Origins  1921–1935  In the 1920s and 30s  the Egyptologist Dr  Margaret Murray published several books detailing her theories that those persecuted as witches during the early modern period in Europe were not  as the persecutors had claimed  followers of Satanism  but adherents of a surviving pre Christian pagan religion – the Witch Cult  These hypotheses  which were argued over by academics for decades  have since been widely rejected   It was during the 1930s that the first evidence appears for the practice of a pagan Witchcraft religion  what would be recognisable now as Wicca  in England  It seems that several groups around the country  in such places as Norfolk  Cheshire and the New Forest had set themselves up as continuing in the tradition of Murray s Witch Cult  albeit with influences coming from disparate sources such as ceremonial magic  folk magic  Freemasonry  Theosophy  Romanticism  Druidry  classical mythology and Asian religions   5 2  Early development  1936–1959  The history of modern Wicca starts with Gerald Gardner  the  Father of Wicca   in the mid 20th century  Gardner was a retired British civil servant and amateur anthropologist  with a broad familiarity in paganism and occultism  He claimed to have been initiated into a witches  coven of New Forest  Hampshire  in the late 1930s  Intent on perpetuating this craft  Gardner founded the Bricket Wood coven with his wife Donna in the 1940s  after buying the Naturist Fiveacres Country Club  Much of the coven s early membership was drawn from the club s members and its meetings were held within the club grounds  Many notable figures of early Wicca were direct initiates of this coven  including Dafo  Doreen Valiente  Jack Bracelin  Frederic Lamond  Dayonis  Eleanor Bone and Lois Bourne   The Witchcraft religion became more prominent beginning in 1951  with the repeal of the Witchcraft Act of 1735  after which Gerald Gardner and then others such as Charles Cardell and Cecil Williamson began publicising their own versions of the Craft  Gardner and others never used the term  Wicca  as a religious identifier  simply referring to the  witch cult    witchcraft   and the  Old Religion   However  Gardner did refer to witches as  the Wica   During the 1960s  the name of the religion normalised to  Wicca   Gardner s tradition  later termed Gardnerianism  soon became the dominant form in England and spread to other parts of the British Isles   5 3  Adaptation and spread  1960–present  Following Gardner s death in 1964  the Craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in British tabloids  with new traditions being propagated by figures like Robert Cochrane  Sybil Leek and most importantly Alex Sanders  whose Alexandrian Wicca  which was predominantly based upon Gardnerian Wicca  albeit with an emphasis placed on ceremonial magic  spread quickly and gained much media attention  Around this time  the term  Wicca  began to be commonly adopted over  Witchcraft  and the faith was exported to countries like Australia and the United States   It was in the United States and in Australia that new  home grown traditions  sometimes based upon earlier  regional folk magical traditions and often mixed with the basic structure of Gardnerian Wicca  began to develop  including Victor Anderson s Feri Tradition  Joseph Wilson s 1734 Tradition  Aidan Kelly s New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn and eventually Zsuzsanna Budapest s Dianic Wicca  each of which emphasised different aspects of the faith  It was also around this time that books teaching people how to become Witches themselves without formal initiation or training began to emerge  among them Paul Huson s Mastering Witchcraft  1970  and Lady Sheba s Book of Shadows  1971   Similar books continued to be published throughout the 1980s and 1990s  fuelled by the writing of such authors as Doreen Valiente  Janet Farrar  Stewart Farrar and Scott Cunningham  who popularised the idea of self initiation into the Craft  Among witches in Canada  anthropologist Dr  Heather Botting  nee Harden  of the University of Victoria has been one of the most prominent  having been the first recognized Wiccan chaplain of a public university  Original high priestess of Coven Celeste  she is one of the founders of the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church   In the 1990s  amid ever rising numbers of self initiates  the popular media began to explore  witchcraft  in fictional films like The Craft and television series like Charmed  introducing numbers of young people to the idea of religious witchcraft  This growing demographic was soon catered to through the Internet and by authors like Silver RavenWolf  much to the criticism of traditional Wiccan groups and individuals  In response to the way that Wicca was increasingly portrayed as trendy  eclectic  and influenced by the New Age movement  many Witches turned to the pre Gardnerian origins of the Craft  and to the traditions of his rivals like Cardell and Cochrane  describing themselves as following  Traditional Witchcraft   Prominent groups within this Traditional Witchcraft revival included Andrew Chumbley s Cultus Sabbati and the Cornish Ros an Bucca coven   6  Debates over the origin of Wicca  According to Gerald Gardner s account in Witchcraft Today and The Meaning of Witchcraft  Wicca is the survival of a hypothetical European witch cult that was persecuted during the witch trials  Theories of an organised pan European witch cult  as well as mass trials thereof  have been largely discredited  but it is still common for Wiccans to claim solidarity with witch trial victims   The notion of the survival of Wiccan traditions and rituals from ancient sources is contested by most recent researchers  who suggest that Wicca is a 20th century creation which combines elements of freemasonry and 19th century occultism  However  historians such as Ronald Hutton have noted that Wicca not only predates the modern New Age movement but also differs markedly in its general philosophy   In his 1999 book The Triumph of the Moon  Ronald Hutton researched the Wiccan claim that ancient pagan customs have survived into modern times after being Christianised in medieval times as folk practices  Hutton found that most of the folk customs which are claimed to have pagan roots  such as the Maypole dance  actually date from the Middle Ages  He concluded that the idea that medieval revels were pagan in origin is a legacy of the Protestant Reformation   Modern scholarly investigations have concluded that Witch trials were substantially fewer than claimed by Gardner  and seldom at the behest of religious authorities  For example  in the 1996 book Witches and Neighbors  Robin Briggs examines the history of witchcraft in medieval Europe and refutes the widely told story that large numbers of independent women were burned at the stake by vindictive Christian ecclesiastics for the crime of practising naturalistic healing or neopagan religion  Most scholars estimate that a total of 40 000 people were executed as witches during the entire medieval period  and that church authorities participated reluctantly in this process  which was largely fuelled by the political turmoil of the Reformation   7  Demographics  The actual number of Wiccans worldwide is unknown  and it has been noted that it is more difficult to establish the numbers of members of Neopagan faiths than many other religions due to their disorganised structure  However  Adherents com  an independent website which specialises in collecting estimates of world religions  cites over thirty sources with estimates of numbers of Wiccans  principally from the USA and UK   From this  they developed a median estimate of 800 000 members   In the United States  the American Religious Identification Survey has shown significant increases in the number of self identified Wiccans  from 8 000 in 1990  to 134 000 in 2001  and 342 000 in 2008  Approximately 75 percent of American Wiccans are female  Wiccans have also made up significant proportions of various groups within that country  for instance  Wicca is the largest non Christian faith practised in the United States Air Force  with 1 434 airmen identifying themselves as such   In the United Kingdom  census figures on religion were first collected in 2001  A campaign by the Pagan Federation before the 2001 Census encouraged Wiccans  Heathens  Druids and others to describe their religion simply as  Pagan  but no detailed statistics were reported outside of the six main religions  For the 2011 census a more detailed breakdown of responses was reported with 56 620 people identifying themselves as Pagans  11 766 as Wiccans and a further 1 276 describing their religion as  Witchcraft    8  Acceptance of Wiccans  Wicca emerged in a predominantly Christian country  and from its inception suffered opposition from certain Christian groups and from the popular tabloids like the News of the World  Some Christians still believe that Wicca is a form of Satanism  despite important differences between these religions  Due to negative connotations associated with witchcraft  many Wiccans continue the traditional practice of secrecy  concealing their faith for fear of persecution  Revealing oneself as Wiccan to family  friends or colleagues is often termed  coming out of the broom closet   In a similar way  some people have accused Wicca of being anti Christian  a claim disputed by Wiccans such as Doreen Valiente  who stated that whilst she knew many Wiccans who admired Jesus   witches have little respect for the doctrines of the churches  which they regard as a lot of man made dogma    In the United States  a number of legal decisions have improved and validated the status of Wiccans  especially Dettmer v  Landon in 1986  However  Wiccans have encountered opposition from some politicians and Christian organisations  including former president of the United States George W  Bush  who stated that he did not believe Wicca to be a religion   In Canada  Dr  Heather Botting   Lady Aurora   and Dr  Gary Botting   Pan    the original high priestess and high priest of Coven Celeste and founding elders of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church  successfully campaigned the British Columbian government and the federal government in 1995 to allow them to perform recognised Wiccan weddings  to become prison and hospital chaplains  and  in the case of Heather Botting  to become the first officially recognized Wiccan chaplain in a public university  The Bottings had been initiated into Wicca in 1966 by Gerald Gardner s London based high priestess  Lysbeth Turner   9  References  9 1  Notes  9 2  Sources  9 2 1  Academic books  9 2 2  Journal articles  9 2 3  Wiccan literature  10
