A wiki     is a web application which allows collaborative modification  extension or deletion of its content and structure  In a typical wiki  text is written using a simplified markup language  known as  wiki markup   or a rich text editor  While a wiki is a type of content management system  it differs from a blog or most other such systems in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader  and wikis have little implicit structure  allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users   The encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki on the public web in terms of page views  but there are many sites running many different kinds of wiki software  Wikis can serve many different purposes both public and private  including knowledge management  notetaking  community websites and intranets  Some permit control over different functions  levels of access   For example  editing rights may permit changing  adding or removing material  Others may permit access without enforcing access control  Other rules may also be imposed to organize content   Ward Cunningham  the developer of the first wiki software  WikiWikiWeb  originally described it as  the simplest online database that could possibly work    Wiki   pronounced   is a Hawaiian word meaning  quick    1  Characteristics  Ward Cunningham and co author Bo Leuf  in their book The Wiki Way  Quick Collaboration on the Web  described the essence of the Wiki concept as follows   A wiki invites all users to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site  using only a plain vanilla Web browser without any extra add ons   Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation almost intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not   A wiki is not a carefully crafted site for casual visitors  Instead  it seeks to involve the visitor in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the Web site landscape  A wiki enables communities to write documents collaboratively  using a simple markup language and a web browser  A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a  wiki page   while the entire collection of pages  which are usually well interconnected by hyperlinks  is  the wiki   A wiki is essentially a database for creating  browsing  and searching through information  A wiki allows non linear  evolving  complex and networked text  argument and interaction   A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated  Generally  there is no review before modifications are accepted  Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts  Many edits can be made in real time and appear almost instantly online  This can facilitate abuse of the system  Private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages  and sometimes even to read them   Maged N  Kamel Boulos  Cito Maramba and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social Darwinism    Unfit  sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled  edited and replaced if they are not considered  fit   which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page  While such openness may invite  vandalism  and the posting of untrue information  this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a  quality  wiki page    1 1  Editing wiki pages  Some wikis have an  edit  button or link directly on the page being viewed  if the user has permission to edit the page  This leads to an editing page which allows participants to structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language  sometimes known as wikitext  for example  starting a line of text with an asterisk often sets up a bulleted list   The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations  some of which also allow HTML tags  Wikis favour plain text editing  with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML  for indicating style and structure  Although limiting access to HTML and Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content  there are some benefits  Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel  and having JavaScript disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users  access   Wikis can make WYSIWYG editing available to users  usually by means of JavaScript control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding HTML tags or wikitext  In those implementations  the markup of a newly edited  marked up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server transparently  shielding the user from this technical detail  However  WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext  and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor  Hence  many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly  An example of this is the VisualEditor on Wikipedia   Some wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages  often  every version of the page is stored  This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page  should it be necessary because a mistake has been made or the page has been vandalized  Many implementations  like MediaWiki  allow users to supply an edit summary when they edit a page  this is a short piece of text summarising the changes  It is not inserted into the article  but is stored along with that revision of the page  allowing users to explain what has been done and why  this is similar to a log message when making changes to a revision control system   1 2  Navigation  Within the text of most pages there are usually a large number of hypertext links to other pages  This form of non linear navigation is more  native  to wiki than structured formalized navigation schemes  Users can also create any number of index or table of contents pages  with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like  These may be challenging to maintain by hand  as multiple authors create and delete pages in an ad hoc manner  Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages   Some wikis have a backlink feature  which displays all pages that link to a given page  It is typical in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist  as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki   1 3  Linking and creating pages  Links are created using a specific syntax  the so called  link pattern   Originally  most wikis used CamelCase to name pages and create links  These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them  the word  CamelCase  is itself an example   While CamelCase makes linking very easy  it also leads to links which are written in a form that deviates from the standard spelling  To link to a page with a single word title  one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word  e g   WiKi  instead of  Wiki    CamelCase based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as  TableOfContents  and  BeginnerQuestions   It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links  pretty  by reinserting spaces  and possibly also reverting to lower case  However  this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal  For example   RichardWagner  should be rendered as  Richard Wagner   whereas  PopularMusic  should be rendered as  popular music   There is no easy way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized  As a result  many wikis now have  free linking  using brackets  and some disable CamelCase by default   1 4  Searching  Most wikis offer at least a title search  and sometimes a full text search  The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database  Some wikis  such as PmWiki  use flat files  MediaWiki s first versions used flat files  but it was rewritten by Lee Daniel Crocker in the early 2000s to be a database application  Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis  Alternatively  external search engines such as Google Search can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results   2  History  WikiWikiWeb was the first wiki  Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland  Oregon  in 1994  and installed it on the Internet domain c2 com on March 25  1995  It was named by Cunningham  who remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the  Wiki Wiki Shuttle  bus that runs between the airport s terminals  According to Cunningham   I chose wiki wiki as an alliterative substitute for  quick  and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick web    Cunningham was in part inspired by Apple s HyperCard  which he had used before but which was single user  Apple had designed a system allowing users to create virtual  card stacks  supporting links among the various cards  Cunningham developed Vannevar Bush s ideas by allowing users to  comment on and change one another s text   Cunningham says his goals were to link together the experiences of multiple people to create a new literature to document programming patterns  and to harness people s natural desire to talk and tell stories with a technology that would feel comfortable to those not used to  authoring    Wikipedia became the most famous wiki site  entering the top ten most popular websites in 2007  In the early 2000s  wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software  Common uses included project communication  intranets  and documentation  initially for technical users  Some companies use wikis as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets  and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning  There may be greater use of wikis behind firewalls than on the public Internet  On March 15  2007  the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary   3  Implementations  Wiki software is a type of collaborative software that runs a wiki system  allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser  It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing web server  or as a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers  The content is stored in a file system  and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system  A commonly implemented software package is MediaWiki  which runs Wikipedia  See the List of wiki software for further information  Alternatively  personal wikis run as a standalone application on a single computer  WikidPad is an example  Or even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside – like TiddlyWiki   Wikis can also be created on a  wiki farm   where the server side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner  PBwiki  Socialtext  Wetpaint  and Wikia are popular examples of such services  Some wiki farms can also make private  password protected wikis  Note that free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page  For more information  see Comparison of wiki farms   4  Trust and security  4 1  Controlling changes  Wikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes  rather than making it difficult to make them  Thus  while wikis are very open  they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages  The most prominent  on almost every wiki  is the  Recent Changes  page—a specific list numbering recent edits  or a list of edits made within a given time frame  Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts   bots     From the change log  other functions are accessible in most wikis  the revision history shows previous page versions and the diff feature highlights the changes between two revisions  Using the revision history  an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article  The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary  A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the  Recent Changes  page and  if it is an unacceptable edit  consult the history  restoring a previous revision  this process is more or less streamlined  depending on the wiki software used   In case unacceptable edits are missed on the  recent changes  page  some wiki engines provide additional content control  It can be monitored to ensure that a page  or a set of pages  keeps its quality  A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages  allowing him or her to verify the validity of new editions quickly  A watchlist is a common implementation of this   Some wikis also implement  patrolled revisions   in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism  A  flagged revisions  system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed   4 2  Trustworthiness  Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with  while proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it  Lars Aronsson  a data systems specialist  summarizes the controversy as follows   High editorial standards in medicine have led to the idea of expert moderated wikis  Some wikis allow one to link to specific versions of articles  which has been useful to the scientific community  in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles  improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article   Noveck points out that  participants are accredited by members of the wiki community  who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product  on the basis of their ongoing participation   On controversial topics that have been subject to disruptive editing  a wiki may restrict editing to registered users   4 3  Security  The open philosophy of wiki – allowing anyone to edit content  does not ensure that every editor s intentions are well mannered  For example  vandalism  changing wiki content to something offensive  adding nonsense or deliberately adding incorrect information  can be a major problem  On larger wiki sites  such as those run by the Wikimedia Foundation  vandalism can go unnoticed for some period of time  Wikis  because of their open access nature  are susceptible to intentional disruption  known as  trolling   Wikis tend to take a soft security approach to the problem of vandalism  making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage  Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods  such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit  In this way vandalism can be limited to just  minor vandalism  or  sneaky vandalism   where the characters added eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them  An example of a bot which is used on Wikipedia to revert vandalism is ClueBot NG  ClueBot NG has the ability to revert edits  often  within minutes  if not seconds   The bot uses machine learning in lieu of heuristics   The amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is  For instance  some wikis allow unregistered users  identified by their IP addresses  to edit content  while others limit this function to just registered users  Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account  but give registered users additional editing functions  on most wikis  becoming a registered user is a short and simple process  Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools  For example  on the English Wikipedia  registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits  Other wikis such as the Portuguese Wikipedia use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement  granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor  Vandalism of Wikipedia is common  though policed and usually reverted  because it is extremely open  allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it  although this makes it grow rapidly  In contrast  Citizendium requires an editor s real name and short autobiography  affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism   Edit wars can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor  Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate   Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki  For instance  a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors  Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies   4 3 1  Potential malware vector  Malware can also be problem  as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code  For example  a German Wikipedia article about the Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website  Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would be infected  A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a blacklist of malware sites   5  Communities  5 1  Applications  The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic  Other large wikis include the WikiWikiWeb  Memory Alpha  Wikivoyage and Susning nu  a Swedish language knowledge base  Medical and health related wiki examples include Ganfyd  an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non medical experts   Many wiki communities are private  particularly within enterprises  They are often used as internal documentation for in house systems and applications  Some companies use wikis to allow customers to help produce software documentation  A study of corporate wiki users found that they could be divided into  synthesizers  and  adders  of content  Synthesizers  frequency of contribution was affected more by their impact on other wiki users  while adders  contribution frequency was affected more by being able to accomplish their immediate work  In 2005  the Gartner Group  noting the increasing popularity of wikis  estimated that they would become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009  Wikis can be used for project management   Wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries  In those settings  they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing  strategic planning  departmental documentation  and committee work  In the mid 2000s  the increasing trend among industries toward collaboration was placing a heavier impetus upon educators to make students proficient in collaborative work  inspiring even greater interest in wikis being used in the classroom   Wikis have found some use within the legal profession  and within government  Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency s Intellipedia  designed to share and collect intelligence  dKospedia  which was used by the American Civil Liberties Union to assist with review of documents pertaining to internment of detainees in Guantánamo Bay  and the wiki of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  used to post court rules and allow practitioners to comment and ask questions  The United States Patent and Trademark Office operates Peer to Patent  a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications  Queens  New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park  Cornell Law School founded a wiki based legal dictionary called Wex  whose growth has been hampered by restrictions on who can edit   5 2  WikiNodes  WikiNodes are pages on wikis that describe related wikis  They are usually organized as neighbors and delegates  A neighbor wiki is simply a wiki that may discuss similar content or may otherwise be of interest  A delegate wiki is a wiki that agrees to have certain content delegated to that wiki   One way of finding a wiki on a specific subject is to follow the wiki node network from wiki to wiki  another is to take a Wiki  bus tour   for example     5 3  Participants  The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are reader  author  wiki administrator and system administrator  The system administrator is responsible for installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server  The wiki administrator maintains wiki content and is provided additional functions pertaining to pages  e g  page protection and deletion   and can adjust users  access rights by  for instance  blocking them from editing   5 4  Growth factors  A study of several hundred wikis showed that a relatively high number of administrators for a given content size is likely to reduce growth  that access controls restricting editing to registered users tends to reduce growth  that a lack of such access controls tends to fuel new user registration  and that higher administration ratios  i e  admins user  have no significant effect on content or population growth   6  Conferences  Conferences and meetings about wikis in general include   The International Symposium on Wikis  WikiSym   a conference dedicated to wiki research and practice in general   RecentChangesCamp  an unconference on wiki related topics Conferences on specific wiki sites and applications include   Atlassian Summit  an annual conference for users of Atlassian software  including Confluence  RegioWikiCamp  a semi annual unconference on  regiowikis   or wikis on cities and other geographic areas   SMWCon  a bi annual conference for users and developers of Semantic MediaWiki   TikiFest  a frequently held meeting for users and developers of Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware   Wikimania  an annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of Wikimedia Foundation projects like Wikipedia   7  Rules  Wikis typically have a set of rules governing user behavior  Wikipedia  for instance  has a labyrinthine set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia  Wikipedia has a neutral point of view  Wikipedia is free content  Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner  and Wikipedia does not have firm rules  Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments  For instance  Conservapedia commands  among other things  that its editors use  B C   rather than  B C E   when referring to years prior to A D  1 and refrain from  unproductive activity   One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki   Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you    8  Legal environment  Joint authorship of articles  in which different users participate in correcting  editing  and compiling the finished product  can also cause editors to become tenants in common of the copyright  making it impossible to republish without the permission of all co owners  some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing  However  where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia  there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable  Despite most wikis  tracking of individual contributions  the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting  editing  or compiling which would give rise to joint ownership   Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an open content license  Version 2 of the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing  Creative Commons licenses are also popular  When no license is specified  an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki  although the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances   Wikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki  If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls  such as banning copyright infringers  that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement  he may be deemed to have authorized infringement  especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit  such as advertising revenue  from infringing activities  In the United States  wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  which protects sites that engage in  Good Samaritan  policing of harmful material  with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self policing  However  it has also been argued that a wiki s enforcement of certain rules  such as anti bias  verifiability  reliable sourcing  and no original research policies  could pose legal risks  When defamation occurs on a wiki  theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable  because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the  publication   It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider  which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications  contents  than a publisher   It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis  since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions  Joshua Jarvis notes   Once misinformation is identified  the trade mark owner can simply edit the entry    9  See also  Comparison of wiki software  Content management system  CURIE  Dispersed knowledge  List of wikis  Mass collaboration
