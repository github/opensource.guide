Natural resources occur naturally within environments that exist relatively undisturbed by humanity  in a natural form  A natural resource is often characterized by amounts of biodiversity and geodiversity existent in various ecosystems   Natural resources are derived from the environment  Some of them are essential for our survival while most are used for satisfying our needs  Natural resources may be further classified in different ways   Natural resources are materials and components  something that can be used  that can be found within the environment  Every man made product is composed of natural resources  at its fundamental level   A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water  and air  as well as a living organism such as a fish  or it may exist in an alternate form which must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores  oil  and most forms of energy   There is much debate worldwide over natural resource allocations  this is partly due to increasing scarcity  depletion of resources  but also because the exportation of natural resources is the basis for many economies  particularly for developed nations    Some natural resources such as sunlight and air can be found everywhere  and are known as ubiquitous resources  However  most resources only occur in small sporadic areas  and are referred to as localized resources  There are very few resources that are considered inexhaustible  will not run out in foreseeable future  – these are solar radiation  geothermal energy  and air  though access to clean air may not be   The vast majority of resources are exhaustible  which means they have a finite quantity  and can be depleted if managed improperly   1  Classification  There are various methods of categorizing natural resources  these include source of origin  stage of development  and by their renewability  These classifications are described below  On the basis of origin  resources may be divided into   Biotic – Biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere  living and organic material   such as forests and animals  and the materials that can be obtained from them  Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter   Abiotic – Abiotic resources are those that come from non living  non organic material  Examples of abiotic resources include land  fresh water  air and heavy metals including ores such as gold  iron  copper  silver  etc  Considering their stage of development  natural resources may be referred to in the following ways   Potential resources – Potential resources are those that exist in a region and may be used in the future  For example petroleum occurs with sedimentary rocks in various regions  but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use  it remains a potential resource   Actual resources – Actual resources are those that have been surveyed  their quantity and quality determined and are being used in present times  The development of an actual resource  such as wood processing depends upon the technology available and the cost involved   Reserve resources – The part of an actual resource which can be developed profitably in the future is called a reserve resource   Stock resources – Stock resources are those that have been surveyed but cannot be used by organisms due to lack of technology  For example  hydrogen  Renewability is a very popular topic and many natural resources can be categorized as either renewable or non renewable   Renewable resources – Renewable resources can be replenished naturally  Some of these resources  like sunlight  air  wind  etc   are continuously available and their quantity is not noticeably affected by human consumption  Though many renewable resources do not have such a rapid recovery rate  these resources are susceptible to depletion by over use  Resources from a human use perspective are classified as renewable only so long as the rate of replenishment recovery exceeds that of the rate of consumption   Non renewable resources – Non renewable resources either form slowly or do not naturally form in the environment  Minerals are the most common resource included in this category  By the human perspective  resources are non renewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishment recovery  a good example of this are fossil fuels  which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow  potentially millions of years   meaning they are considered non renewable  Some resources actually naturally deplete in amount without human interference  the most notable of these being radio active elements such as uranium  which naturally decay into heavy metals  Of these  the metallic minerals can be re used by recycling them  but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled   2  Extraction  Resource extraction involves any activity that withdraws resources from nature  This can range in scale from the traditional use of preindustrial societies  to global industry  Extractive industries are  along with agriculture  the basis of the primary sector of the economy  Extraction produces raw material which is then processed to add value  Examples of extractive industries are hunting  trapping  mining  oil and gas drilling  and forestry  Natural resources can add substantial amounts to a country s wealth  however a sudden inflow of money caused by a resource boom can create social problems including inflation harming other industries   Dutch disease   and corruption  leading to inequality and underdevelopment  this is known as the  resource curse    Extractive industries represent a large growing activity in many less developed countries but the wealth generated does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth  Extractive industry businesses often are assumed to be interested only in maximizing their short term value  implying that less developed countries are vulnerable to powerful corporations  Alternatively  host governments are often assumed to be only maximizing immediate revenue  Researchers argue there are areas of common interest where development goals and business cross  These present opportunities for international governmental agencies to engage with the private sector and host governments through revenue management and expenditure accountability  infrastructure development  employment creation  skills and enterprise development and impacts on children  especially girls and women   3  Depletion  In recent years  the depletion of natural resources has become a major focus of governments and organizations such as the United Nations  UN   This is evident in the UN s Agenda 21 Section Two  which outlines the necessary steps to be taken by countries to sustain their natural resources  The depletion of natural resources is considered to be a sustainable development issue  The term sustainable development has many interpretations  most notably the Brundtland Commission s  to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs   however in broad terms it is balancing the needs of the planet s people and species now and in the future  In regards to natural resources  depletion is of concern for sustainable development as it has the ability to degrade current environments and potential to impact the needs of future generations   Depletion of natural resources is associated with social inequity  Considering most biodiversity are located in developing countries  depletion of this resource could result in losses of ecosystem services for these countries  Some view this depletion as a major source of social unrest and conflicts in developing nations   At present  with it being the year of the forest  there is particular concern for rainforest regions which hold most of the Earth s biodiversity  According to Nelson deforestation and degradation affect 8 5% of the world s forests with 30% of the Earth s surface already cropped  If we consider that 80% of people rely on medicines obtained from plants and ¾ of the world s prescription medicines have ingredients taken from plants  loss of the world s rainforests could result in a loss of finding more potential life saving medicines   The depletion of natural resources is caused by  direct drivers of change  such as Mining  petroleum extraction  fishing and forestry as well as  indirect drivers of change  such as demography  economy  society  politics and technology  The current practice of Agriculture is another factor causing depletion of natural resources  For example the depletion of nutrients in the soil due to excessive use of nitrogen and desertification The depletion of natural resources is a continuing concern for society  This is seen in the cited quote given by Theodore Roosevelt  a well known conservationist and former United States president  was opposed to unregulated natural resource extraction   4  Protection  In 1982 the UN developed the World Charter for Nature  which recognised the need to protect nature from further depletion due to human activity  It states that measures need to be taken at all societal levels  from international to individual  to protect nature  It outlines the need for sustainable use of natural resources and suggests that the protection of resources should be incorporated into national and international systems of law  To look at the importance of protecting natural resources further  the World Ethic of Sustainability  developed by the IUCN  WWF and the UNEP in 1990  set out eight values for sustainability  including the need to protect natural resources from depletion  Since the development of these documents  many measures have been taken to protect natural resources including establishment of the scientific field and practice of conservation biology and habitat conservation  respectively   Conservation biology is the scientific study of the nature and status of Earth s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species  their habitats  and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction  It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on science  economics and the practice of natural resource management  The term conservation biology was introduced as the title of a conference held at the University of California  San Diego  in La Jolla  California  in 1978  organized by biologists Bruce A  Wilcox and Michael E  Soulé   Habitat conservation is a land management practice that seeks to conserve  protect and restore  habitat areas for wild plants and animals  especially conservation reliant species  and prevent their extinction  fragmentation or reduction in range   5  Management  Natural resource management is a discipline in the management of natural resources such as land  water  soil  plants and animals  with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations   Management of natural resources involves identifying who has the right to use the resources and who does not for defining the boundaries of the resource  The resources are managed by the users according to the rules governing of when and how the resource is used depending on local condition   A successful management of natural resources should engage the community because of the nature of the shared resources the individuals who are affected by the rules can participate in setting or changing them  The users have the rights to devise their own management institutions and plans under the recognition by the government  The right to resources includes land  water  fisheries and pastoral rights  The users or parties accountable to the users have to actively monitor and ensure the utilisation of the resource compliance with the rules and to impose penalty on those peoples who violates the rules  These conflicts are resolved in a quick and low cost manner by the local institution according to the seriousness and context of the offence  The global science based platform to discuss natural resources management is the World Resources Forum  based in Switzerland   6  See also  Environmental movement  Resource  7  References  8  Further reading
