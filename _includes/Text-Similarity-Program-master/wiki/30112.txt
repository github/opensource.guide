The politics of Tajikistan takes place in a framework of a presidential republic  whereby the President is both head of state and head of government  and of a multi party system  Legislative power is vested in both the executive branch and the two chambers of parliament   1  Political background  Tajikistan gained its independence during the breakup of the on September 9  1991 and promptly fell into a civil war from 1992舑1997 between old guard regits  and Islamists loosely organized as the United Tajik Opposition  UTO   Other combatants and armed bands that flourished in this civil chaos simply reflected the breakdown of central authority rather than loyalty to a political faction  The height of hostilities occurred between 1992 93  By 1997  the predominantly Kulyabi led Tajik government and the UTO successfully negotiated a power sharing peace accord and implemented it by 2000   Tajikistan is slowly rebuilding itself with an integrated government and continues to permit a Russian military presence to guard their border with Afghanistan and the basing of the Russian 201st Motorized Rifle Division that never left Tajikistan when it became independent  Most of these Russian led forces  however  are local Tajik noncommissioned officers and soldiers   Both Tajikistan s presidential and parliamentary elections  in 1999 and 2000  respectively  were widely considered to be flawed and unfair but peaceful  The inclusion of an Islamist party committed to secular government  Islamic Renaissance Party  and several other parties in the Parliamentary elections represented an improvement in the Tajik people s right to choose their government  Tajikistan is the only Central Asian country in which a religiously affiliated political party is represented in Parliament  President Emomalii Rahmon  while no longer specifically obliged—as he was under the peace accords—to allocate one third of government positions to the UTO  has kept some former UTO officials in senior cabinet level positions  While the government and the now incorporated former opposition continue to distrust each other  they have often found a way to work with each other and are committed to peacefully resolving their differences   Prior to the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001  the civil war in Afghanistan produced cross border effects that threatened to destabilize Tajikistan s fragile and hard won peace  In the summers of 1999 and 2000  the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan used Tajikistan as a staging ground for an insurgency campaign against the government of Uzbekistan  At the same time  Taliban advances in northern Afghanistan threatened to inundate Tajikistan with thousands of refugees  A constant flow of illegal narcotics continues to transit Tajikistan from Afghanistan on its way to Russian and European markets  leaving widespread violent crime  corruption  increased HIV incidence  and economic distortions in its wake  During 2002  stability in the country continued to increase  and the year was largely free of the assassinations and outbreaks of violence perpetrated by unreformed opposition members that plagued the country in previous years   2  Executive branch   President  Emomalii Rahmon  People s Democratic Party of Tajikistan  16 November 1994     Prime Minister  Kokhir Rasulzoda  People s Democratic Party of Tajikistan  23 November 2013    The president  who is directly elected  is both the head of state and the head of government  The president appoints the prime minister and all the members of the government  with parliamentary approval  Tajikistan is thus a presidential republic  Tajikistan held a constitutional referendum on 22 June 2003 and the 2003 Constitution  among other amendments  set a limit of two seven year terms for the president  Emomalii Rahmon s election to the office of the president in 2006 counts as his first 7 year term under the 2003 Constitution  and in principle he may be re elected for a second term in 2013  remaining in office until 2020   In this geographically divided country  the ceremonial position of prime minister traditionally is held by a person from the north to nominally balance President Emomalii Rakhmon’s southern origin  In 2004 the executive branch fell further under the control of the governing party as appointments by Rakhmon left the opposition with only 5 percent of major government positions  This event followed the expiration of the 1997 peace guarantee that the United Tajik Opposition  UTO  would occupy at least 30 percent of top government positions  Prior to the 2006 election  the Council of Ministers  which executes the decisions of the president  included two deputy prime ministers  19 ministers  nine committee heads  and several ex officio members  After the election  Rakhmon abolished 10 ministries and five state committees and reappointed Oqil Oqilov as prime minister  Rakhmon is said to have accumulated substantial informal power through patronage   3  Legislative branch  The bicameral Supreme Assembly  Majlisi Oli  includes the 63 seat Assembly of Representatives  Majlisi namoyandagon   which meets year round  from November through end of June   and the 33 seat National Assembly  Majlisi milli   which meets at least twice per year  The bicameral legislature was introduced in the September 1999 Constitution and prior to that Tajikistan had a unicameral legislature   The members of the Assembly of Representatives are chosen by direct popular election for a five year term  Of the 63 members of the Assembly of Representatives  22 are elected by party  in proportion to the number of votes received by each party gaining at least 5 percent of total votes  and the remaining members are elected from single member constituencies   In the National Assembly  three fourths of the members are chosen by the deputies of the local representative assemblies  majlisi  in the country s four main administrative divisions and in the cities subordinated directly to central government  each of these subnational jurisdictions is entitled to equal representation  The remaining members are appointed directly by the president   The pro government People’s Democratic Party continued to control both houses of the parliament after the elections of 2005  that party gained 52 of the 63 seats in the Assembly of Representatives  In 2006  11 women sat in the Assembly of Representatives  and five sat in the National Assembly  Opposition factions in the Supreme Assembly have clashed with pro government members over some issues   4  Judicial branch  The constitution provides for an independent judiciary  The Supreme Court is the highest court  Other high courts include the Supreme Economic Court and the Constitutional Court  which decides questions of constitutionality  The president appoints the judges of these three courts  with the approval of the legislature  There is also a Military Court  The judges of all courts are appointed to 10 year terms   Though the judiciary is nominally independent  the executive branch and criminal groups have considerable influence on judicial functions  Bribery of judges  who are poorly paid and poorly trained  is commonplace  The court system has local  district  regional  and national levels  with each higher court serving as an appellate court for the level below  Appeals of court decisions are rare because the populace generally does not trust the judicial system  Constitutional guarantees to the right to an attorney and to a prompt and public trial often are ignored  The Soviet era presumption of the guilt of the defendant remains in force  The procurator’s office conducts all criminal investigations  Trials are heard by juries except in cases of national security   5  Administrative divisions  Tajikistan consists of 4 administrative divisions  These are the provinces  viloyat  of Sughd and Khatlon  the autonomous province  viloyati mukhtor  of Gorno Badakhshan  in Tajik  Viloyati Mukhtori Kuhistoni Badakhshon   and the Region of Republican Subordination  Raiony Respublikanskogo Podchineniya in transliteration from Russian or in   formerly known as Karotegin Province   The capital of Sughd is Khujand  formerly Leninabad   the capital of Khatlon is Qurghonteppa  formerly Kurgan Tyube   and the capital of Gorno Badakhshan is Khorugh  formerly Khorog   The national capital Dushanbe is also the administrative center of the Region of Republican Subordination  Each region is divided into several districts    nohiya or raion   which in turn are subdivided into jamoats  village level self governing units   As of 2008  there were 58 districts and 367 jamoats in Tajikistan  In addition  subregional units included 17 towns and 54 urban type settlements      6  Provincial and local government  Local government is divided into representative and executive branches  The representative branch in provinces  towns  and districts is the assembly  majlis  of people s deputies  who are elected locally for a five year term  The executive power in provinces  towns  and districts is vested in the head of local administration  who is directly appointed by the President  with the approval of the local majlis  ref name const2003   7  Electoral system  Suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years of age and older  A new election law passed in 2004 has received international criticism for its restrictive candidate registration requirements  Election requires an absolute majority of votes  if no candidate gains a majority  a second round is held between the top two vote getters  By controlling the Central Election Commission  the Rahmon regime has gained substantial influence over the registration of parties  the holding of referenda  and election procedures  In 1999 and 2003  referenda of dubious fairness made constitutional changes that strengthened Rahmon’s hold on power  International observers also found substantial irregularities in the conduct of the 1999 presidential election  in which only one opposition candidate was permitted to register  and the media were censored  Six parties participated in the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections  although in both cases observers reported state interference with the process and with opposition candidates’ access to the media  Rahmon easily won re election in November 2006  gaining 79 percent of the vote against four little known opponents  international monitors again found the election unfair  Three major opposition parties—the Democratic Party  the Islamic Rebirth Party  and the Social Democratic Party—boycotted the election   7 1  Recent elections  8  Political parties  In the early 2000s  independent political parties continued to exist  but their operations were circumscribed and their influence marginal  The governing People’s Democratic Party  PDP  gained strength as some opposition party leaders joined the government and others were disqualified from participation in elections  The Communist Party of Tajikistan  a nominal opposition party that has supported President Rahmon on most issues  has lost support since 2000  The liberal  pro market Democratic Party also has lost support  In 1997 Rahmon weakened his chief opposition emerging from the civil war  the United Tajik Opposition  UTO   by naming movement leader Akbar Turajonzoda a deputy prime minister  In the ensuing years  the UTO was eclipsed politically by its main component organization  the Islamic Reinassance Party  IRP   In 2003 the IRP lost its chief opposition issue as the ban on religious parties ended  Nevertheless  in 2006 parties still could not receive aid from religious institutions  and tension remained between the government and Islamic factions  In 2006 the IRP was the most influential opposition party in Tajikistan and the only religiously affiliated party represented in the national legislature of a Central Asian country  After the death of long time IRP leader Said Abdullo Nuri in 2006  a possible split emerged from the struggle for party leadership  Some antigovernment sentiment has been channeled into radical Islamic organizations such as Hizb ut Tahrir  which is outlawed as a terrorist organization  rather than into conventional political parties  In 2006 six parties  including one faction of the Democratic Party  were banned  and a total of eight parties were registered  In 2005 Mahmadruzi Iskandarov  head of the Democratic Party  received a long prison term for terrorism after being abducted from exile  and in 2006 his party was replaced on the official list by a government backed splinter group  Vatan   9  International organization participation  AsDB  CCC  CIS  EAPC
