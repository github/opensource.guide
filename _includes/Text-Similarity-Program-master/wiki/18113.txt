Lyra    Latin for lyre  from Greek λύρα  is a small constellation  It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy  and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union  Its principal star  Vega  Abhijit in Sanskrit   a corner of the Summer Triangle  is one of the brightest stars in the sky  Beginning at the north  Lyra is bordered by Draco  Hercules  Vulpecula  and Cygnus   Lyra is visible from the northern hemisphere from spring through autumn  and nearly overhead  in temperate latitudes  during the summer months  From the southern hemisphere  it is visible low in the northern sky during the winter months   1  Notable features  1 1  Stars  Lyra s brightest stars include the following   α Lyr  Vega   With an apparent brightness of 0 03m  it is the third brightest star of the northern hemisphere  after Arcturus  and the fifth brightest star in all  its spectral class is A0 V and it lies at a distance of only 25 3 ly   β Lyr  Sheliak   A group of eclipsing binaries is named after this variable star  3 45m  spectral class B8 II   the Beta Lyrae stars   γ Lyr  Sulafat   The main star of this multiple star system is of magnitude 3 24m and spectral class B9 III   δ1 Lyr  A double star consisting of a blue white star of mag  6m and a semi regular red giant   ε Lyr  A well known quadruple star  also called  the Double Double  because each of the two brighter components is a double star   ζ Lyr  Another double star  which can be split using binoculars   RR Lyr lends its name to a class of pulsating variable  RR Lyrae stars   DM Lyr is a dwarf nova  namely a close binary consisting of a white dwarf and a low mass star where the former strips off material from the latter  forming an accretion disc which explodes brightly from time to time   Kepler 37   star with smallest extrasolar planet known so far  February 2013   Kepler 62   star with a five planet system discovered by Kepler spacecraft in April 2013   1 2  Deep sky objects  M57  also known as the  Ring Nebula  and NGC 6720  has a diameter of one light year and is at a distance of 2 000 light years from Earth  It is one of the best known planetary nebulae and the second to be discovered  its integrated magnitude is 8 8  It was discovered in 1779 by Antoine Darquier  15 years after Charles Messier discovered the Dumbbell Nebula  Astronomers have determined that it is between 6 000 and 8 000 years old  it is approximately one light year in diameter  The outer part of the nebula appears red in photographs because of emission from ionized hydrogen  The middle region is colored green  doubly ionized oxygen emits greenish blue light  The hottest region  closest to the central star  appears blue because of emission from helium  The central star itself is a white dwarf with a temperature of 120 000 Kelvin  In telescopes  the nebula appears as a visible ring with a green tinge  it is slightly elliptical because its three dimensional shape is a torus or cylinder seen from a slight angle  It can be found halfway between Gamma Lyrae and Beta Lyrae   Kuiper 90 is also known as 17 Lyrae C  Gliese 747AB   a red dwarf system near 17 Lyrae  but 26 light years from the Sun  Its period is 5 years  and its magnitude is 11 26 in the V band   BD +36 3317   a white star in the young open cluster Stephenson 1  was discovered as a binary eclipsing system by Violat Bordonau in 2008  its period is 4 30216 days  its other name is VSX J185422 2+365107   NGC 6745 is an irregular spiral galaxy in Lyra that is at a distance of 208 million light years  Several million years ago  it collided with a smaller galaxy  which created a region filled with young  hot  blue stars  Astronomers do not know if the collision was simply a glancing blow or a prelude to a full on merger  which would end with the two galaxies incorporated into one larger  probably elliptical galaxy   The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall is a giant galaxy filament situated 10 billion light years away  With the size nearly equal to its distance  10 billion light years in length  it is the largest known structure in the universe  covering the entirety of Lyra   1 3  Exoplanets  Exoplanets including WASP 3b  HAT P 5b  GJ 758 b and c  HD 178911 Bb  HD 177830 b  TrES 1  and HD 173416 b have been discovered in Lyra  In January 2010 the Kepler Mission announced the discovery of the additional planets Kepler 7b  Kepler 8b  and three planets around Kepler 9 are expected to be the first of many discovered by the mission  which has a significant part of its field of view in Lyra   In April 2013  it was announced that of the five planets orbiting Kepler 62  at least two    Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f—are within the boundaries of the habitable zone of that star  where scientists think liquid water could exist  and are both candidates for being a solid  rocky  earth like planet  The exoplanets are 1 6 and 1 4 times the diameter of Earth respectively  with their star Kepler 62 at a distance of 1 200 light years   2  History  In the past  Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre  either enclosed in its wings  or in its beak  It was sometimes referred to as Aquila Cadens or Vultur Cadens  falling eagle or falling vulture   This historical association is preserved in the name of its brightest star  Vega  which is derived from an Arabic term meaning  swooping eagle    3  Mythology  In Greek mythology  Lyra was associated with the myth of Orpheus  the musician who was killed by the Bacchantes  After his death  his lyre was thrown into the river  Zeus sent an eagle to retrieve the lyre  and ordered both of them to be placed in the sky  In Wales  Lyra is known as King Arthur s Harp  Talyn Arthur   and King David s harp   The Persian Hafiz called it the Lyre of Zurah  It has been called the Manger of the Infant Saviour  Praesepe Salvatoris    In Japanese mythology  originating from the Chinese Qixi festival  Vega is sometimes called Tanabata  or Orihime   a celestial princess or goddess  She falls in love with a mortal  Kengyu  or Hikoboshi   represented by the star Altair  But when Tanabata’s father finds out  he is enraged and forbids her to see this mere mortal  Thus the two lovers are placed in the sky  where they are separated by the Celestial River  known to us as Milky Way  Yet the sky gods are kind  Each year  on the 7th night of the 7th moon  a bridge of magpies forms across the Celestial River  and the two lovers are reunited  Sometimes Kengyu’s annual trip across the Celestial River is treacherous  though  and he doesn’t make it  In that case  Tanabata’s tears form raindrops that fall over Japan   Many Japanese celebrations of Tanabata are held in July  but sometimes they are held in August  If it rains  the raindrops are thought to be Tanabata’s tears because Kengyu could not meet her  Sometimes the meteors of the Perseid shower are said to be Tanabata’s tears   4  Equivalents in other astronomical systems  Vega and its surrounding stars are also treated as a constellation in other cultures   In Australian Aboriginal astronomy  Lyra is known by the Boorong people in Victoria as the Malleefowl constellation   Lyra was known as Urcuchillay by the Incas and was worshipped as an animal deity   5  In History  John
