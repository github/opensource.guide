Maine      is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States  bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south  New Hampshire to the west  and the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the northeast  Maine is both the northernmost and easternmost portion of New England  It is known for its scenery—its jagged  mostly rocky coastline  its low  rolling mountains  its heavily forested interior  and picturesque waterways—as well as for its seafood cuisine  especially lobster and clams  Maine is the northernmost U S  state with an Atlantic coastline  but in spite of its maritime position it has a continental climate even in coastal cities such as the largest state city of Portland   For thousands of years  indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine  At the time of European encounter  several Algonquian speaking peoples inhabited the area  The first European settlement in Maine was by the French in 1604 on Saint Croix Island  by Pierre Dugua  Sieur de Mons  The first English settlement in Maine  the short lived Popham Colony  was established by the Plymouth Company in 1607  A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s  although the rugged climate  deprivations  and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the years   As Maine entered the 18th century  only a half dozen European settlements had survived  Patriot and Loyalist forces contended for Maine s territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812  Maine was part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts  On March 15  1820  it was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state under the Missouri Compromise  Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 41st most populous of the 50 United States  With respect to crime rates  Maine is also often considered the safest state in the U S  Maine is the state with the highest percentage of non Hispanic whites in the union   1  Geography  To the south and east is the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and northeast is New Brunswick  a province of Canada  The Canadian province of Quebec is to the northwest  Maine is both the northernmost state in New England and the largest  accounting for almost half the region s entire land area  Maine is the only state to border only one other state  New Hampshire to the west    Maine is the easternmost state in the United States both in its extreme points and its geographic center  The municipalities of Eastport and Lubec are  respectively  the easternmost city and town in the United States  Estcourt Station is Maine s northernmost point  as well as the northernmost point in New England   For more information see extreme points of the United States    Maine s Moosehead Lake is the largest lake wholly in New England  as Lake Champlain is located between Vermont  New York and Quebec  A number of other Maine lakes  such as South Twin Lake  are described by Thoreau in The Maine Woods  1864   Mount Katahdin is both the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail  which extends southerly to Springer Mountain  Georgia  and the southern terminus of the new International Appalachian Trail which  when complete  will run to Belle Isle  Newfoundland and Labrador   Maine has several unique geographical features  Machias Seal Island and North Rock  off its easternmost point  are claimed by both the U S  and Canada and are within one of four areas between the two countries whose sovereignty is still in dispute  but it is the only one of the disputed areas containing land  Also in this easternmost area in the Bay of Fundy is the Old Sow  the largest tidal whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere   Maine is the least densely populated U S  state east of the Mississippi River  It is called the Pine Tree State  about 83% of its land is forested  In the forested areas of the interior lie much uninhabited land  some of which does not have formal political organization into local units  a rarity in New England   The Northwest Aroostook  Maine unorganized territory in the northern part of the state  for example  has an area of and a population of 10  or one person for every    Maine is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  The land near the southern and central Atlantic coast is covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests  The remainder of the state  including the North Woods  is covered by the New England Acadian forests   Maine has almost of coastline  and of tidal coastline   West Quoddy Head is the easternmost piece of land in the contiguous 48 United States  Along the famous rock bound coast of Maine are lighthouses  beaches  fishing villages  and thousands of offshore islands  including the Isles of Shoals  which straddle the New Hampshire border  There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets  Inland are lakes  rivers  forests  and mountains  This visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by American poet Edna St  Vincent Millay of Rockland and Camden  Maine in  Renascence    Geologists describe this type of landscape as a  drowned coast   where a rising sea level has invaded former land features  creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops  A rise in the elevation of the land due to the melting of heavy glacier ice caused a slight rebounding effect of underlying rock  this land rise  however  was not enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of former land features   Much of Maine s geomorphology was created by heavy glacial activity at the end of the last ice age  Prominent glacial features include Somes Sound and Bubble Rock  both part of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island  Carved by glaciers  Somes Sound is considered to be the only fjord on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of   The extreme depth and steep drop off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound  These features also have made it attractive for boat builders  such as the prestigious Hinckley Yachts  Bubble Rock is what is known as a  glacial erratic  and is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in Acadia National Park  By analyzing the type of granite  geologists were able to discover that glaciers carried Bubble Rock to its present location from the town of Lucerne  Maine — away  The Iapetus Suture runs through the north and west of the state being underlain by the ancient Laurentian terrane and the south and east underlain by the Avalonian terrane   Acadia National Park is the only national park in New England  Areas under the protection and management of the National Park Service include   Acadia National Park near Bar Harbor  Appalachian National Scenic Trail  Maine Acadian Culture in St  John Valley  Roosevelt Campobello International Park near Lubec  Saint Croix Island International Historic Site at Calais  1 1  Climate  Maine experiences a humid continental climate  Köppen climate classification Dfb   with warm  although generally not hot   humid summers  Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state  and are especially severe in the northern parts of Maine  Coastal areas are moderated somewhat by the Atlantic Ocean  resulting in milder winters and cooler summers in immediate coastal areas  Daytime highs are generally in the range throughout the state in July  with overnight lows in the high 50s °F  around 15 °C   January temperatures range from highs near on the southern coast to overnight lows averaging below in the far north   The state s record high temperature is   set in July 1911  at North Bridgton  Precipitation in Maine is evenly distributed year round  but with a slight summer maximum in northern northwestern Maine and a slight late fall or early winter maximum along the coast due to  nor easters  or intense cold season storms  In coastal Maine  the late spring and summer months are usually driest   a rarity across the Eastern United States  Maine has fewer days of thunderstorms than any other state east of the Rockies  with most of the state averaging less than 20 days of thunderstorms a year  Tornadoes are rare in Maine  with the state averaging fewer than two per year  mostly occurring in the southern part of the state   In January 2009  a new record low temperature for the state was set at Big Black River of   tying the New England record   Annual precipitation varies from in Presque Isle  to in Acadia National Park   2  History  The original inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian speaking Wabanaki peoples including the Abenaki  Passamaquoddy  Maliseet and Penobscot  The first European settlement in what is now called Maine was in 1604 on Saint Croix Island  by Pierre Dugua  Sieur de Mons  including Samuel de Champlain  the noted explorer  The French named the entire area Acadia  including the portion that later became the state of Maine  The first English settlement in Maine was established by the Plymouth Company at Popham in 1607  the same year as the settlement at Jamestown  Virginia  The Popham colonists returned to England after 14 months   Two Jesuit missions were established by the French  one on Penobscot Bay in 1609  and the other on Mount Desert Island in 1613  The same year  Castine was established by Claude de La Tour  In 1625  Charles de Saint Étienne de la Tour erected Fort Pentagouet to protect Castine  The coastal areas of western Maine first became the Province of Maine in a 1622 land patent  Eastern Maine north of the Kennebec River was more sparsely settled and was known in the 17th century as the Territory of Sagadahock  A second settlement was attempted at a place called York  in 1623 by English explorer and naval Captain Christopher Levett  granted by King Charles I of England  That settlement also failed   Central Maine was formerly inhabited by people of the Androscoggin tribe  also known as Arosaguntacook  The Androscoggin were a tribe in the Abenaki nation  They were driven out of the area in 1690 during King William s War  They were relocated at St  Francis  Canada  which was destroyed by Rogers  Rangers in 1759  and is now Odanak  The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats  particularly during Dummer s War  with the capture of Norridgewock in 1724 and the defeat of the Pequawket in 1725  which greatly reduced their numbers  They finally withdrew to Canada  where they were settled at Bécancour and Sillery  and later at St  Francis  along with other refugee tribes from the south   The province within its current boundaries became part of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1652  Maine was much fought over by the French  English and allied natives during the 17th and early 18th centuries  who conducted raids against each other  taking captives for ransom or  in some cases  adoption by Native American tribes  For instance  in early 1692  the Abenaki raided York  killing about 100 of the English settlers and taking another estimated 80 villagers hostage  The Abenaki took captives taken during raids of Massachusetts in Queen Anne s War of the early 1700s to Kahnewake  a Catholic Mohawk village near Montreal  where some were adopted and others ransomed   After the British defeated the French in Acadia in the 1740s  the territory from the Penobscot River east fell under the nominal authority of the Province of Nova Scotia  and together with present day New Brunswick formed the Nova Scotia county of Sunbury  with its court of general sessions at Campobello  American and British forces contended for Maine s territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812  and British forces occupied eastern Maine in both conflicts  The treaty concluding revolution was ambiguous about Maine s boundary with British North America  The territory of Maine was confirmed as part of Massachusetts when the United States was formed  although the final border with British territory was not established until the Webster Ashburton Treaty of 1842   Maine was physically separate from the rest of Massachusetts  Long standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede  the vote failed  Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the War of 1812 when Massachusetts pro British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders  In 1819  Massachusetts agreed to permit secession if voters in Maine approved  Due to these considerations and rapid population growth  in 1820 Maine voted to secede from Massachusetts  The secession and formation of the state of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15  1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise  which geographically limited the spread of slavery and enabled the admission to statehood of Missouri the following year  keeping a balance between slave and free states   Maine s original capital was Portland  Maine s largest city  until it was moved to Augusta in 1832 to make it more central within the state  The principal office of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court remains in Portland   The 20th Maine  under the command of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain  defended Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg  Its soldiers prevented the Union Army from being flanked by the Confederate Army   Four U S  Navy ships have been named USS Maine in honor of the state   2 1  Etymology  There is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name  Maine   The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco American Day  which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine  Other theories mention earlier places with similar names  or claim it is a nautical reference to the mainland  The history of the name of Maine began with James Sullivan s 1795  History of the District of Maine   He made the unsubstantiated allegation that the Province of Maine was a compliment to the queen of Charles I  Henrietta Maria  who once  owned  the Province of Maine in France  This was quoted by almost all Maine historians until the 1845 Agnes Strickland biography established that she had no connection to the Province of Maine in France  King Charles I married Henrietta Maria in 1625  three years after the name Maine first appeared on the charter  A new theory  set forth by Carol B  Smith Fisher  is that The Province of MAINE was first chosen by Sir Ferdinando Gorges in 1622 to honor the village where his ancestral roots first took hold on English soil   MAINE  appears in the Doomsday Book of 1086 in reference to the county of Dorset  that is today Broadmayne  just southeast of Dorchester  This is where the Gorges family roots first took hold on English soil  The generally held view amongst British place name scholars is that Mayne in Dorset is Brythonic  corresponding to modern Welsh  maen   plural  main  or  meini   Some early spellings are  MAINE 1086  MEINE 1200  MEINES 1204  MAYNE 1236  Today the actual village is known as BROADMAYNE  which is primitive Welsh or Brythonic   main  meaning rock or stone  considered to be a reference to the many large sarsens still present around Little Mayne farm  half a mile northeast of Broadmayne village   The first known record of the name appears in an August 10  1622  land charter to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason  English Royal Navy veterans  who were granted a large tract in present day Maine that Mason and Gorges  intend to name the Province of Maine   Mason had served in the Royal Navy in the Orkney Islands where the chief island is called Mainland  a more likely name derivation for these English sailors than the French province  A year later  in 1623  the English naval captain Christopher Levett  exploring the New England coast  wrote   The first place I set my foote upon in New England was the Isle of Shoals  being Ilands in the sea  above two Leagues from the Mayne   Initially  several coastal tracts along the coast of New England were referred to as Main or Maine  cf  the Spanish Main   A reconfirmed and enhanced April 3  1639  charter from England s King Charles I gave Sir Ferdinando Gorges increased powers over his new province and stated that it  shall forever hereafter  be called and named the PROVINCE OR COUNTIE OF MAINE  and not by any other name or names whatsoever     Whatever the origin  the name was fixed in 1665 when the King s Commissioners ordered that the  Province of Maine  be entered from then on in official records  Maine is the only state whose name has exactly one syllable  and is the only state to border only one other   3  Demographics  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Maine was 1 330 089 on July 1  2014  a 0 13% increase since the 2010 United States Census  The population density of the state is 41 3 people per square mile  making it the least densely populated state in New England  the American northeast  the eastern seaboard  of all of the states with an Atlantic coastline and of all of the states east of the Mississippi River   The mean population center of Maine is located in Kennebec County  just east of Augusta  The Greater Portland metropolitan area is the most densely populated with nearly 40% of Maine s population  As explained in detail under  Geography   there are large tracts of uninhabited land in some remote parts of the interior   3 1  Race  ancestry  and language  At the 2010 Census  94 4% of the population was non Hispanic White  1 1% non Hispanic Black or African American  0 6% American Indian and Alaska Native  1 0% Asian  0 1% from some other race and 1 4% of two or more races  1 3% of Maine s population was of Hispanic  Latino  or Spanish origin   In 2011  the largest ancestries in the state were estimated to be   23 9% French or French Canadian  21 6% English  17 8% Irish  9 4% American  8 5% German  5 8% Italian  5 5% Scottish  2 1% Polish  1 8% Swedish  1 7% Scots Irish People citing that they are American are of overwhelmingly English descent  but have ancestry that has been in the region for so long  often since the 1600s  that they choose to identify simply as Americans   Maine has the highest percentage of French Americans among U S  states  It also has the highest percentage of non Hispanic whites of any state  at 94 4% of the total population  according to the 2010 Census  In 2011  89 0% of all births in the state were to two non Hispanic white parents  The state has the highest percentage of current French speakers of any state  most are descended from Quebecois immigrants who arrived between 1840 and 1930  and New Brunswick prior to 1842  In northern Maine   particularly Aroostook County   Acadians still speak French at home  since their relatives live in neighboring New Brunswick  Census figures show that Maine has the highest percentage of people speaking French at home of any state  5 28% of Maine households are French speaking  compared with 4 68% in Louisiana  French speakers are the state s chief linguistic minority  the 2000 Census reported 92 25% of Maine residents aged five and older spoke only English at home  Maine does not have an official language  but the most widely spoken language in the state is English   The upper St  John River valley area was once part of the so called Republic of Madawaska  before the frontier was decided in the Webster Ashburton Treaty of 1842  Over one quarter of the population of Lewiston  Waterville  and Biddeford are Franco American  Most of the residents of the Mid Coast and Down East sections are chiefly of British heritage  Smaller numbers of various other groups  including Irish  Italian and Polish  have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century immigration waves    3 2  Religion  According to the Association of Religion Data Archives  ARDA   the religious affiliations of Maine in 2010 were   Catholic Church – 28%  Protestant – 7%  Evangelical Protestant   4%  The Catholic Church was the largest religious institution with 202 106 members   The United Methodist Church had 28 329 members

34th in the nation  As of August 2013  Maine s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 7 0%   Maine s agricultural outputs include poultry  eggs  dairy products  cattle  wild blueberries  apples  maple syrup and maple sugar  Aroostook County is known for its potato crops  Commercial fishing  once a mainstay of the state s economy  maintains a presence  particularly lobstering and groundfishing  Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water   Maine s industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper  lumber and wood products  electronic equipment  leather products  food products  textiles  and bio technology  Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well  with Bath Iron Works in Bath and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery   Brunswick Landing  formerly Naval Air Station Brunswick  is also in Maine  Formerly a large support base for the U S  Navy  the BRAC campaign initiated the Naval Air Station s closing  despite a government funded effort to upgrade its facilities  The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park  as well as a new satellite campus for Southern Maine Community College   Maine is the number one exporter of low bush blueberries  The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in Strong  Maine  The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20 million toothpicks a day  It closed in May 2003   Tourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine s economy  The state is a popular destination for sport hunting  particularly deer  moose and bear   sport fishing  snowmobiling  skiing  boating  camping and hiking  among other activities   Maine ports play a key role in national transportation  Beginning around 1880  Portland s rail link and ice free port made it Canada s principal winter port  until the aggressive development of Halifax  Nova Scotia  in the mid 1900s  In 2001  Maine s largest city of Portland surpassed Boston as New England s busiest port  by tonnage   due to its ability to handle large tankers  Maine s Portland International Jetport was recently expanded  providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines   Maine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state  and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers  particularly in the pulp and paper industry  Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include Fairchild Semiconductor in South Portland  IDEXX Laboratories  in Westbrook  Hannaford Bros  Co  in Scarborough  Unum in Portland  TD Bank  in Portland  L L  Bean in Freeport  Cole Haan and DeLorme  both located in Yarmouth  Maine is also the home of The Jackson Laboratory  the world s largest non profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world s largest supplier of genetically purebred mice   4 1  Taxation  Maine has an income tax structure containing two brackets  6 5% to 7 95% of personal income  Prior to July 2013  Maine had four brackets  2%  4 5%  7%  and 8 5%  Maine s general sales tax rate is 5 5%  temporarily raised from 5% until June 30  2015  The state also

cents per pound  $1 50 per 100 pounds  of the fruit sold each season  All real and tangible personal property located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute  The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns  while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor   4 2  Shipbuilding  Maine has a longstanding tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies  In the 18th and 19th centuries  Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships  The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas  One of these yards was located in Pennellville Historic District in what is now Brunswick  Maine  This yard  owned by the Pennell family  was typical of the many family owned shipbuilding companies of the time period  Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses  During the 18th and 19th centuries  wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy   5  Transportation  5 1  Airports  Maine receives passenger jet service at its two largest airports  the Portland International Jetport in Portland  and the Bangor International Airport in Bangor  Both are served daily by many major airlines to destinations such as New York  Atlanta  and Orlando  Essential Air Service also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine  bringing small turboprop aircraft to regional airports such as the Augusta State Airport  Hancock County Bar Harbor Airport  Knox County Regional Airport  and the Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle  These airports are served by Cape Air with Cessna 402s and Penair with Saab 340s  Many smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine  only serving general aviation traffic  The Eastport Municipal Airport  for example  is a city owned public use airport with 1 200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single engine and ultralight aircraft   5 2  Highways  Interstate 95  I 95  travels through Maine  as well as its easterly branch I 295 and spurs 195  395 and the unsigned I 495  In addition  U S  Route 1  US 1  starts in Fort Kent and travels to Florida  The eastern terminus of the eastern section of US 2 starts in Houlton  near the New Brunswick  Canada border to Rouses Point  New York  at US 11  US 2A connects Old Town and Orono  primarily serving the University of Maine campus  US 201 and US 202 flow through the state  US 2  Maine State Route&nbsp 6  Route 6   and Route 9 are often used by truckers and other motorists of the Maritime Provinces en route to other destinations in the United States or as a short cut to Central Canada   5 3  Rail  5 3 1  Passenger  The Downeaster passenger train  operated by Amtrak  provides passenger service between Brunswick and Boston s North Station  with stops in Freeport  Portland  Old Orchard Beach  Saco  and Wells  The Downeaster makes five daily trips  two of which continue past Portland to Brunswick   Seasonal passenger excursions between Brunswick and Rockland are operated by the Maine Eastern Railroad  which leases the state owned Rockland Branch rail corridor   5 3 2  Freight  Freight service throughout the state is provided by a handful of regional and shortline carriers  Pan Am Railways  formerly known as Guilford Rail System   which operates the former Boston & Maine and Maine Central railroads  St  Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad  Maine Eastern Railroad  Central Maine and Quebec Railway  and New Brunswick Southern Railway   6  Law and government  The Maine Constitution structures Maine s state government  composed of three co equal branches—the executive  legislative  and judicial branches  The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers  the Secretary of State  the State Treasurer  and the State Attorney General  and one Statutory Officer  the State Auditor    The legislative branch is the Maine Legislature  a bicameral body composed of the Maine House of Representatives  with 151 members  and the Maine Senate  with 35 members  The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws   The executive branch is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the Governor of Maine  currently Paul LePage   The Governor is elected every four years  no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office  The current attorney general of Maine is Janet Mills  As with other state legislatures  the Maine Legislature can by a two thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto  Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor   The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting state laws  The highest court of the state is the Maine Supreme Judicial Court  The lower courts are the District Court  Superior Court and Probate Court  All judges except for probate judges serve full time  are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature for terms of seven years  Probate judges serve part time and are elected by the voters of each county for four year terms   6 1  Counties  Maine is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties  In 1860 there were 16 counties in the state  ranging in size from    6 2  State and local politics  In state general elections  Maine voters tend to accept independent and third party candidates more frequently than most states  Maine has had two independent governors recently  James B  Longley  1975–1979 and Angus King  1995–2003   Maine state politicians  Republicans and Democrats alike  are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties   Maine is an alcoholic beverage control state   On May 6  2009  Maine became the fifth state to legalize same sex marriage  however  the law was repealed by voters on November 3  2009  On November 6  2012  Maine  along with Maryland and Washington  became the first state to legalize same sex marriage at the ballot box   6 3  Federal politics  In the 1930s  Maine was one of very few states which retained Republican sentiments  In the 1936 presidential election  Franklin D  Roosevelt received the electoral votes of every state other than Maine and Vermont  these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns  though Maine was closely fought in 1940 and 1944  In the 1960s  Maine began to lean toward the Democrats  especially in presidential elections  In 1968  Hubert Humphrey became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine  perhaps because of the presence of his running mate  Maine Senator Edmund Muskie  although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s   Since 1969  two of Maine s four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election  the other two go to the highest vote getter in each of the state s two congressional districts  Every other state except Nebraska gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large  without regard to performance within districts   Ross Perot achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996  In 1992  as an independent candidate  Perot came in second to Democrat Bill Clinton  despite the longtime presence of the Bush family summer home in Kennebunkport  In 1996  as the nominee of the Reform Party  Perot did better in Maine than in any other state   Maine has voted for the Democratic candidate in six successive presidential elections  casting its votes for Bill Clinton twice  Al Gore in 2000  John Kerry in 2004  and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012  Although Democrats have carried the state in presidential elections in recent years  Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state s U S  Senate seats  with Edmund Muskie  William Hathaway and George J  Mitchell being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U S  Senate in the past fifty years   In the 2010 midterm elections  Republicans made major gains in Maine  They captured the governor s office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s  However  in 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of Maine Legislature   Maine s U S  senators are Republican Susan Collins and Independent Angus King  The governor is Republican Paul LePage  The state s two members of the United States House of Representatives are Democrats  Chellie Pingree and Mike Michaud   7  Municipalities  7 1  Organized municipalities  An organized municipality has a form of elected local government which administers and provides local services  keeps records  collects licensing fees  and can pass locally binding ordinances  among other responsibilities of self government  The governmental format of most organized towns and plantations is the town meeting  while the format of most cities is the council manager form  As of 2013 the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 cities  431 towns  and 34 plantations  Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state s territory  Maine also has 3 Reservations  Indian Island  Indian Township Reservation  and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation   The largest municipality in Maine  by population  is the city of Portland  pop  64 249    The smallest city by population is Eastport  pop  1 640    The largest town by population is Brunswick  pop  20 278    The smallest town by population is Frye Island  a resort town which reported zero year round population in the 2000 Census  one plantation  Glenwood Plantation  Maine  also reported a permanent population of zero   In the 2000 census  the smallest town aside from Frye Island was Centerville with a population of 26  but since that census  Centerville voted to disincorporate and therefore is no longer a town  The next smallest town with a population listed in that census is Beddington  pop  50 at the 2010 census    The largest municipality by land area is the town of Allagash  at    The smallest municipality by land area is the plantation of Monhegan Island  at   The smallest municipality by area that is not an island is Randolph  at    7 2  Unorganized territory  Unorganized territory has no local government  Administration  services  licensing  and ordinances are handled by the state government  The unorganized territory of Maine consists of over 400 townships  towns are incorporated  townships are unincorporated   plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any
