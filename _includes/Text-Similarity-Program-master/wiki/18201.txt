Lake Champlain  French  Lac Champlain  is a natural freshwater lake in North America  located mainly within the borders of the United States  states of Vermont and New York  but partially situated across the Canada United States border in the Canadian province of Quebec   The New York portion of the Champlain Valley includes the eastern portions of Clinton County and Essex County  Most of this area is part of the Adirondack Park  There are recreational opportunities in the park and along the relatively undeveloped coastline of Lake Champlain  The cities of Plattsburgh  New York and Burlington  Vermont are to the north of the lake  and the village of Ticonderoga  New York is located in the southern part of the region  The Quebec portion is located in the regional county municipalities of Le Haut Richelieu and Brome Missisquoi   1  Geology  The Champlain Valley is the northernmost unit of a landform system known as the Great Appalachian Valley  which system stretches from Quebec to Alabama  The Champlain Valley is a physiographic section of the larger Saint Lawrence Valley  which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division   It is one of numerous large lakes located in an arc from Labrador through the northern United States and into the Northwest Territories of Canada  Although it is smaller than each of the Great Lakes  Ontario  Erie  Huron  Superior  or Michigan  Lake Champlain is a large body of fresh water  Approximately in area  the lake is roughly long  and across at its widest point  The maximum depth is approximately   The lake varies seasonally from about above mean sea level   1 1  Hydrology  Lake Champlain is situated in the Lake Champlain Valley between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York  drained northward by the  long Richelieu River into the St  Lawrence River at Sorel Tracy  Quebec northeast and downstream of Montreal  It also receives the waters from the  long Lake George  so its basin collects waters from the northwestern slopes of the Green Mountains of Vermont and the northernmost eastern peaks of the Adirondack Mountains of New York   The lake drains nearly half of Vermont  About 250 000 people get their drinking water from the lake   The lake is fed by Otter Creek  the Winooski  Poultney  Missisquoi  and Lamoille Rivers in Vermont  and the Ausable  Chazy  Boquet  Saranac and La Chute rivers in New York   It is connected to the Hudson River by the Champlain Canal   Portions of the lake freeze each winter  and in some winters the entire lake surface freezes  referred to as  closing   The lake temperature reaches an average of in July and August   1 2  Chazy Reef  The Chazy Reef is an extensive Ordovician carbonate rock formation which extends from Tennessee to Quebec and Newfoundland  It occurs in prominent outcropping at Goodsell Ridge  Isle La Motte  the northernmost island in Lake Champlain   The oldest reefs are around  The Head  of the south end of the island  slightly younger reefs are found at the Fisk Quarry  and the youngest  the famous coral reefs  are located in fields to the north  Together  these three sites provide a unique narrative of events which took place over 450 million years ago in the ocean in the Southern Hemisphere  long before the emergence of Lake Champlain 20 thousand years ago   2  History  The lake was named after the French explorer Samuel de Champlain  who encountered it in 1609  While the ports of Burlington  Vermont  Port Henry  New York  and Plattsburgh  New York today are primarily used by small craft  ferries and lake cruise ships  they were of substantial commercial and military importance in the 18th and 19th centuries   A variety of Native American names for the lake were recorded by historians  Many historical works give Caniaderi Guarunte as the Iroquois name for the lake  meaning  mouth or door of the country   the lake was an important northern gateway to their lands  A number of other sources give Petonbowk  meaning the lake in between  as the Abenaki name in their Algonquian language for the lake  The St  Francis Sokoki Abenaki Band  who make their home along the Masipskiwibi River  in Missisquoi language   Crooked River   in northwestern Vermont  call the lake Bitawbagok  which has the same meaning as Petonbowk  Some early 21st century articles appeared during the Champlain Quadricentennial  2009  claiming Ondakina as the “local” native name for the lake  but none cites a verifiable source   2 1  Colonial America and the Revolutionary War  New France allocated concessions all along lake Champlain to French settlers  and built forts to defend the waterways  In colonial times  Lake Champlain was used as a water passage  or  in winter  ice  between the Saint Lawrence and the Hudson valleys  Travelers found it easier to journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than to go overland on the unpaved and frequently mud bound roads of the time  The northern tip of the lake at Saint Jean sur Richelieu  Quebec  known as St  John in colonial times under British rule  is a short distance from Montreal  The southern tip at Whitehall  Skenesborough in revolutionary times  is a short distance from Saratoga  Glens Falls  and Albany  New York   Forts were built at Ticonderoga and Crown Point  Fort St  Frederic  to control passage on the lake in colonial times  Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1775  During the Revolutionary War  the British and Americans conducted a frenetic shipbuilding race through the Spring and Summer of 1776 at opposite ends of the lake  fighting a significant naval engagement on October 11 at the Battle of Valcour Island  While it was a tactical defeat for the Americans and the small fleet led by Benedict Arnold was almost entirely destroyed  the Americans gained a strategic victory  The British invasion was delayed long enough so that the approach of winter prevented the fall of these forts until the following year  In this period  the Continental Army gained strength and was victorious at Saratoga   2 2  War of 1812  During the War of 1812  British and American forces faced each other in the Battle of Lake Champlain  also known as the Battle of Plattsburgh  fought on September 11  1814  This ended the final British invasion of the northern states during the War of 1812  It was fought just prior to the signing of the Treaty of Ghent  and the American victory denied the British any leverage to demand exclusive control over the Great Lakes or territorial gains against the New England states   Three US Naval ships have been named after this battle  including the USS Lake Champlain  CV 39   the USS Lake Champlain  CG 57   and a cargo ship used during World War I   Following the War of 1812  the US Army began construction on  Fort Blunder   an unnamed fortification built at the northernmost end of Lake Champlain to protect against attacks from British Canada  Its nickname came from a surveying error  the initial phase of construction on the fort turned out to be taking place on a point north of the Canadian border  Once this error was spotted  construction was abandoned  Locals scavenged materials used in the abandoned fort for use in their own homes and public buildings   By the Webster Ashburton Treaty of 1842  the US Canadian border was adjusted northward to include the strategically important site of  Fort Blunder  on the US side  In 1844  work was begun to replace the remains of the 1812 era fort with a massive new Third System masonry fortification known as Fort Montgomery  Portions of this fort are still standing   2 3  Modern history  In the early 19th century  the construction of the Champlain Canal connected Lake Champlain to the Hudson River system  allowing north south commerce by water from New York City to Montreal and Atlantic Canada   In 1909  65 000 people celebrated the 300th anniversary of the French discovery of the lake  Attending dignitaries included President William Howard Taft  along with representatives from France  Canada and the United Kingdom   In 1929  then New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt and Vermont Governor John Weeks  dedicated the first bridge to span the lake  built from Crown Point to Chimney Point  This bridge lasted until December 2009  Severe deterioration was found  and the bridge was demolished and replaced with the Lake Champlain Bridge  which opened in November 2011   On February 19  1932  boats were able to sail on Lake Champlain  It was the first time that the lake was known to be free of ice during the winter at that time   Lake Champlain briefly became the nation s sixth Great Lake on March 6  1998  when President Clinton signed Senate Bill 927  This bill  which reauthorized the National Sea Grant Program  contained a line declaring Lake Champlain to be a Great Lake  This status enabled its neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources  Following a small uproar  the Great Lake status was rescinded on March 24  although New York and Vermont universities continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake    2 4   Champ   Lake Champlain monster  In 1609 Samuel de Champlain wrote that he saw a lake monster five feet  1 5 m  long  as thick as a man s thigh  with silver gray scales a dagger could not penetrate  The alleged monster had jaws with sharp and dangerous teeth  Native Americans claimed to have seen similar monsters   This mysterious creature is likely the original Lake Champlain monster  The monster has been memorialized in sports teams names and mascots  the Vermont Lake Monsters and mascot  Champ  of the state s minor league baseball team  A Vermont Historical Society publication recounts the story and offers factual explanations for accounts of the so called monster   floating logs  schools of large sturgeons diving in a row  or flocks of black birds flying close to the water    2 5  Ecology  A pollution prevention  control  and restoration plan for Lake Champlain was first endorsed in October 1996 by the governors of New York and Vermont  and the regional administrators of the EPA  United States Environmental Protection Agency   In April 2003  the plan was updated and Quebec signed onto it  The plan is being implemented by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its partners at the state  provincial  federal and local level  It is renowned as a model for interstate and international cooperation  Its primary goals are to reduce phosphorus inputs to Lake Champlain  reduce toxic contamination  minimize the risks to humans from water related health hazards  and control the introduction  spread  and impact of non native nuisance species to preserve the integrity of the Lake Champlain ecosystem   Agricultural and urban runoff from the watershed or drainage basin is the primary source of excess phosphorus  which exacerbates algae blooms in Lake Champlain  The most problematic blooms have been cyanobacteria  commonly called blue green algae  in the northeastern part of the Lake  primarily Missisquoi Bay   To reduce phosphorus runoff to this part of the lake  Vermont and Quebec agreed to reduce their inputs by 60% and 40%  respectively  by an agreement signed in 2002  While agricultural sources  manure and fertilizers  are the primary sources of phosphorus  about 70%  in the Missisquoi basin  runoff from developed land and suburbs is estimated to contribute about 46% of the phosphorus runoff basin wide to Lake Champlain  and agricultural lands contributed about 38%   In 2002  the cleanup plan noted that the lake had the capacity to absorb of phosphorus each year  In 2009  a judge noted that were still flowing in annually  more than twice what the lake could handle  Sixty municipal and industrial sewage plants discharge processed waste from the Vermont side   In 2008  the EPA expressed concerns to the State of Vermont that the Lake s cleanup was not progressing fast enough to meet the original cleanup goal of 2016  The State  however  cites its Clean and Clear Action Plan as a model that will produce positive results for Lake Champlain   In 2007  Vermont banned phosphates for dishwasher use starting in 2010  This will prevent an estimated from flowing into the lake  While this represents 0 6% of the phosphate pollution  it took $1 9 million to remove the pollutant rom treated wastewater  an EPA requirement   Despite concerns about pollution  Lake Champlain is safe for swimming  fishing  and boating  It is considered a world class fishery for salmonid species  Lake trout and Atlantic salmon  and bass  About 81 fish species live in the Lake  and more than 300 bird species rely on it for habitat and as a resource during migrations   By 2008 at least six institutions monitoring lake water health  1  In 2002 the Conservation Law Foundation appointed a  lakekeeper   who reviews the state s pollution controls  2  Friends of Missisquoi Bay was formed in 2003  3  the Lake Champlain Committee  4  Vermont Water Resources Board hired a water quality expert in 2008 to write water quality standards and create wetland protection rules  5  In 2007 the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources appoints a  Lake czar  to oversee pollution control  Clean and Clear  an agency of the Vermont state government established in 2004  and 6  the Nature Conservancy  a non profit group  focuses on biodiversity and ecosystem health   In 2001  scientists estimated that farming contributed 38% of the phosphorus runoff  By 2010  results of environmentally conscious farming practices  enforced by law  had made any positive contribution to lake cleanliness  A federally funded study was started to analyze this problem and to arrive at a solution   Biologists have been trying to control lampreys in the lake since 1985 or earlier  Lampreys are native to the area  but have expanded in population to such an extent that they wounded nearly all Lake trout in 2006 and 70 80% of salmon  The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their casualties of other fish to 35% of salmon and 31% of lake trout  The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of lake trout   The federal and state governments originally budgeted $18 million for lake programs for 2010  This was later supplemented by an additional $6 5 million from the federal government   2 6  Railroad  Historically four significant railroad crossings were built over the lake  As of 2011  only one remains   The  floating  rail trestle from Larabees Point  Vermont to Ticonderoga  New York was operated by the Addison Branch of the Rutland Railroad  It was abandoned in 1918 due to a number of accidents which resulted in locomotives and rail cars falling into the lake   The Island Line Causeway  This marble rock landfill causeway stretched from Colchester  Vermont  on the mainland  three miles  5 km  north and west to South Hero  Vermont  Two breaks in the causeway were spanned by a fixed iron trestle and a swing bridge that could be opened to allow boats to pass  Rutland Railroad  later Rutland Railway  operated trains over this causeway from 1901 1961  The Railway was officially abandoned in 1963  with tracks and trestles removed over the course of the ten years that followed  The marble causeway still remains  as does the fixed iron trestle that bridges the lesser of the two gaps  The swing bridge over the navigation channel was removed sometime in the early 1970s  Now called Colchester Park  the main three mile  5 km  causeway has been adapted and preserved as a recreation area for cyclists  runners  and anglers  Two smaller marble rock landfill causeways were also erected as part of this line that connected Grand Isle to North Hero  Vermont and from North Hero to Alburgh   The Alburgh  Vermont   Rouses Point  New York rail trestle  From sometime in the late 19th century until 1964  this wooden trestle carried two railroads  the Rutland Railroad and the Central Vermont Railroad  over the lake just south of the US 2 vehicular bridge  The iron swing bridge at the center  over the navigation channel  has been removed  Most of the wooden pilings remain and can easily be seen looking south from the US 2 bridge  Part of the trestle on the Rouses Point side has been converted for use as an access pier associated with the local marina   The Swanton   Alburgh  Vermont rail trestle  Built in the same manner as at Rouses Point  it crosses the lake just south of Missisquoi Bay and the Canadian border  within yards south of the Vermont Route 78 bridge  It is still in use by the New England Central Railroad   3  Natural history  In 2010  the estimate of cormorant population  now classified as a nuisance species because they take so much of the lake fish  ranged from 14 000 to 16 000  A Fish and Wildlife commissioner said that the ideal population would be 3 300 or about 3 per   Cormorants had disappeared from the lake  and all northern lakes  due to the use of DDT in the 1940s and 1950s  which made their eggs more fragile and reduced breeding populations   Ring billed gulls are also considered a nuisance  Measures have been taken to reduce their population  Authorities are trying to encourage the return of black crowned night herons  cattle egrets  and great blue herons  which disappeared during the time DDT was being widely used   4  Infrastructure  4 1  Lake crossings  The Alburgh Peninsula  also known as the Alburgh Tongue   extending south from the Quebec shore of the lake into Vermont  is accessible from the rest of the state only via Canada  This is a distinction shared with Point Roberts  Washington  and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota as well as Province Point  see below   Unlike the other three cases  this is no longer of practical significance because highway bridges across the lake provide access to the peninsula from within the United States  from three directions    4 1 1  Province Point  Vermont  A few kilometres to the northeast of the town of East Alburgh  Vermont  Province Point is the southernmost tip of a small promontory approximately in size   The promontory is cut through by the US Canadian border  as such the area is a practical exclave of the United States contiguous with Canada   4 1 2  Mainland  Two roadways cross over the lake  connecting Vermont and New York   Since November 2011  the Lake Champlain Bridge has crossed the southern part of the lake  connecting Chimney Point in Vermont with Crown Point  New York  It replaced Champlain Bridge  which was closed in 2009 because of severe structural problems found that could have resulted in a collapse  In 2009  the bridge had been used by 3 400 drivers per day  and driving around the southern end of the lake added two hours to the trip  Ferry service was re established to take some of the traffic burden  On December 28  2009  the bridge was destroyed in a controlled demolition  A new bridge was rapidly constructed by a joint state commitment  opening on November 7  2011   To the north  US 2 runs from Rouses Point  New York to Grand Isle County  Vermont in the town of Alburgh  before continuing south along a chain of islands towards Burlington  To the east  Vermont Route 78 runs from an intersection with US 2 in Alburgh through East Alburgh to Swanton  The US 2 VT 78 route technically runs from the New York mainland to an extension of the mainland between two arms of the lake and then to the Vermont mainland  but it provides a direct route across the two main arms of the northern part of the lake   4 1 3  Ferry  North of Ticonderoga  New York  the lake widens appreciably  ferry service is operated by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company at   Charlotte  Vermont to Essex  New York  may not travel when the lake is frozen   Burlington  Vermont to Port Kent  New York  seasonal   Grand Isle  Vermont to Cumberland Head  part of Plattsburgh  New York  year round icebreaking service  While the old bridge was being demolished and the new one constructed  Lake Champlain Transportation Company operated a free  24 hour ferry from just south of the bridge to Chimney Point in Vermont at the expense of the states of New York and Vermont at a cost to the states of about $10 per car   The most southerly crossing is the Fort Ticonderoga Ferry  connecting Ticonderoga  New York with Shoreham  Vermont just north of the historic fort   4 1 4  Railroad  The Swanton  VT  to East Alburg  Vermont  rail trestle   4 2  Waterways  Lake Champlain has been connected to the Erie Canal via the Champlain Canal since the canal s official opening September 9  1823  the same day as the opening of the Erie Canal from Rochester on Lake Ontario to Albany  It connects to the St  Lawrence River via the Richelieu River  with the Chambly Canal bypassing rapids on the river since 1843  Together with these waterways the lake is part of the Lakes to Locks Passage  The Lake Champlain Seaway  a project to use the lake to bring ocean going ships from New York City to Montreal  was proposed in the late 19th century and considered as late as the 1960s  but rejected for various reasons   5  Surroundings  5 1  Major cities  Burlington  Vermont  pop  42 217  2010 Census  is the largest city on the lake  The 2nd and 3rd most populated cities towns are  Plattsburgh  New York  and Colchester  Vermont  respectively  combined  The fourth largest community is the city of South Burlington   5 2  Islands  Lake Champlain contains roughly 80 islands  three of which comprise four entire Vermont towns  most of Grand Isle County   The largest islands   South Hero Island  the largest  containing the towns of Grand Isle  Vermont and South Hero  Vermont  North Hero Island  containing the town of North Hero  Vermont  Isle La Motte  containing the town of Isle La Motte  Vermont  Valcour Island  New York  Juniper Island

Island  Carleton s Prize  Young Island   Providence Island  Stave Island  5 3  Lighthouses  There is a historic stone lighthouse located on Cumberland Head  which is privately owned   The privately owned Isle La Motte lighthouse on the northern end of the island was originally red  but it faded to pink over time   The privately owned cast iron Juniper Island Light dates from 1846  In 1954 it was deactivated and replaced by a steel tower   On Point Au Roche  part of Beekmantown  New York  there is a privately owned  historic lighthouse   Valcour Island  near the New York shore is home to Bluff Point Lighthouse  built in 1871  It was manned by a full time lightkeeper until 1930  making it one of the last lighthouses to be manned on the Lake  The Cumberland Head Light operated until 1934   Split Rock Lighthouse  NY south of Essex  NY  near a natural boundary of the territory between the Mohawk and Algonquin tribes   5 4  Aids to navigation  All active navigational aids on the American portion of the lake are maintained by USCG Burlington station  along with those on international Lake Memphremagog to the east  Aids to navigation on the Canadian portion of the lake are maintained by the Canadian Coast Guard   5 5  Parks  There are a number of parks in the Lake Champlain region of both Vermont and New York   Two on the New York side of the lake include Point Au Roche State Park  which have hiking and cross country skiing trails  A public beach is located on park grounds  and the Ausable Point State Park  The Cumberland Bay State Park is located on Cumberland Head  with a campground  city beach  and sports fields   There are various parks along the lake on the Vermont side  including Sand Bar State Park in Milton  featuring a natural sand beach  swimming canoe and kayak rentals  food concession  picnic grounds and a play area  At   Grand Isle State Park contains camping facilities  a sand volleyball court  a nature walk trail  a horseshoe pit and a play area  Burlington s Waterfront Park is a revitalized industrial area   6  Public safety  Coast Guard Station Burlington provides  Search and Rescue  Law Enforcement and Ice Rescue services 24 hours a day  365 days a year   Services are also provided by local  and state  and federal governments bordering on the lake  including the US Border Patrol  Royal Canadian Mounted Police  Vermont State Police  New York State Police Marine Detail  and Vermont Fish and Wildlife wardens   7  See also  Champlain Sea  post glacial predecessor to Lake Champlain  Île aux Noix  List of New York rivers  Burlington
