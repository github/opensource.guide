Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation  as opposed to general symbolic manipulations  for the problems of mathematical analysis  as distinguished from discrete mathematics    One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection  YBC 7289   which gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of   the length of the diagonal in a unit square  Being able to compute the sides of a triangle  and hence  being able to compute square roots  is extremely important  for instance  in astronomy  carpentry and construction   Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations  Much like the Babylonian approximation of   modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers  because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice  Instead  much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors   Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences  but in the 21st century also the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations  Ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics  planets  stars and galaxies   numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis  stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology   Before the advent of modern computers numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables  Since the mid 20th century  computers calculate the required functions instead  These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations   1  General introduction  The overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems  the variety of which is suggested by the following   Advanced numerical methods are essential in making numerical weather prediction feasible   Computing the trajectory of a spacecraft requires the accurate numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations   Car companies can improve the crash safety of their vehicles by using computer simulations of car crashes  Such simulations essentially consist of solving partial differential equations numerically   Hedge funds  private investment funds  use tools from all fields of numerical analysis to attempt to calculate the value of stocks and derivatives more precisely than other market participants   Airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms to decide ticket prices  airplane and crew assignments and fuel needs  Historically  such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field of operations research   Insurance companies use numerical programs for actuarial analysis  The rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis   1 1  History  The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries  Linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago  Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis  as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like Newton s method  Lagrange interpolation polynomial  Gaussian elimination  or Euler s method   To facilitate computations by hand  large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients  Using these tables  often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions  one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions  The canonical work in the field is the NIST publication edited by Abramowitz and Stegun  a 1000 plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points  The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available  but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy   The mechanical calculator was also developed as a tool for hand computation  These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s  and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes  But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis  since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done   1 2  Direct and iterative methods  Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps  These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in infinite precision arithmetic  Examples include Gaussian elimination  the QR factorization method for solving systemsof linear equations  and the simplex method of linear programming  In practice  finite precision is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution  assuming stability    In contrast to direct methods  iterative methods are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps  Starting from an initial guess  iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit  A convergence test  often involving the residual  is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has  hopefully  been found  Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps  in general   Examples include Newton s method  the bisection method  and Jacobi iteration  In computational matrix algebra  iterative methods are generally needed for large problems   Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis  Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not  e g  GMRES and the conjugate gradient method  For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method   1 3  Discretization  Furthermore  continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem  this process is called discretization  For example  the solution of a differential equation is a function  This function must be represented by a finite amount of data  for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain  even though this domain is a continuum   2  Generation and propagation of errors  The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis  There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem   2 1  Round off  Round off errors arise because it is impossible to represent all real numbers exactly on a machine with finite memory  which is what all practical digital computers are    2 2  Truncation and discretization error  Truncation errors are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated  and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution  Similarly  discretization induces a discretization error because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem  For instance  in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of   after 10 or so iterations  we conclude that the root is roughly 1 99  for example   We therefore have a truncation error of 0 01   Once an error is generated  it will generally propagate through the calculation  For instance  we have already noted that the operation + on a calculator  or a computer  is inexact  It follows that a calculation of the type a+b+c+d+e is even more inexact   What does it mean when we say that the truncation error is created when we approximate a mathematical procedure  We know that to integrate a function exactly requires one to find the sum of infinite trapezoids  But numerically one can find the sum of only finite trapezoids  and hence the approximation of the mathematical procedure  Similarly  to differentiate a function  the differential element approaches to zero but numerically we can only choose a finite value of the differential element   2 3  Numerical stability and well posed problems  Numerical stability is an important notion in numerical analysis  An algorithm is called numerically stable if an error  whatever its cause  does not grow to be much larger during the calculation  This happens if the problem is well conditioned  meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount  To the contrary  if a problem is ill conditioned  then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error   Both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be well conditioned and or ill conditioned  and any combination is possible   So an algorithm that solves a well conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable  An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well posed mathematical problem  For instance  computing the square root of 2  which is roughly 1 41421  is a well posed problem  Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation x1 to   for instance x1 1 4  and then computing improved guesses x2  x3  etc   One such method is the famous Babylonian method  which is given by xk+1   xk 2 + 1 xk  Another iteration  which we will call Method X  is given by xk + 1    xk2蜢2 2 + xk  We have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below  with initial guesses x1   1 4 and x1   1 42   Observe that the Babylonian method converges fast regardless of the initial guess  whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess 1 4 and diverges for initial guess 1 42  Hence  the Babylonian method is numerically stable  while Method X is numerically unstable   The example is taken from Mathew  Numerical methods using matlab  3rd ed   3  Areas of study  The field of numerical analysis includes many sub disciplines  Some of the major ones are   3 1  Computing values of functions  One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point  The most straightforward approach  of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient  For polynomials  a better approach is using the Horner scheme  since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions  Generally  it is important to estimate and control round off errors arising from the use of floating point arithmetic   3 2  Interpolation  extrapolation  and regression  Interpolation solves the following problem  given the value of some unknown function at a number of points  what value does that function have at some other point between the given points   Extrapolation is very similar to interpolation  except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points   Regression is also similar  but it takes into account that the data is imprecise  Given some points  and a measurement of the value of some function at these points  with an error   we want to determine the unknown function  The least squares method is one popular way to achieve this   3 3  Solving equations and systems of equations  Another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation  Two cases are commonly distinguished  depending on whether the equation is linear or not  For instance  the equation is linear while is not   Much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving systems of linear equations  Standard direct methods  i e   methods that use some matrix decomposition are Gaussian elimination  LU decomposition  Cholesky decomposition for symmetric  or hermitian  and positive definite matrix  and QR decomposition for non square matrices  Iterative methods such as the Jacobi method  Gauss–Seidel method  successive over relaxation and conjugate gradient method are usually preferred for large systems  General iterative methods can be developed using a matrix splitting   Root finding algorithms are used to solve nonlinear equations  they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero   If the function is differentiable and the derivative is known  then Newton s method is a popular choice  Linearization is another technique for solving nonlinear equations   3 4  Solving eigenvalue or singular value problems  Several important problems can be phrased in terms of eigenvalue decompositions or singular value decompositions  For instance  the spectral image compression algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition  The corresponding tool in statistics is called principal component analysis   3 5  Optimization  Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized  or minimized   Often  the point also has to satisfy some constraints   The field of optimization is further split in several subfields  depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint  For instance  linear programming deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear  A famous method in linear programming is the simplex method   The method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems   3 6  Evaluating integrals  Numerical integration  in some instances also known as numerical quadrature  asks for the value of a definite integral  Popular methods use one of the Newton–Cotes formulas  like the midpoint rule or Simpson s rule  or Gaussian quadrature  These methods rely on a  divide and conquer  strategy  whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets  In higher dimensions  where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort  one may use Monte Carlo or quasi Monte Carlo methods  see Monte Carlo integration   or  in modestly large dimensions  the method of sparse grids   3 7  Differential equations  Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing  in an approximate way  the solution of differential equations  both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations   Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation  bringing it into a finite dimensional subspace  This can be done by a finite element method  a finite difference method  or  particularly in engineering  a finite volume method  The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from functional analysis  This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation   4  Software  Since the late twentieth century  most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages  The Netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems  mostly in Fortran and C  Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the IMSL and NAG libraries  a free alternative is the GNU Scientific Library   There are several popular numerical computing applications such as MATLAB  TK Solver  S PLUS  LabVIEW  and IDL as well as free and open source alternatives such as FreeMat  Scilab  GNU Octave  similar to Matlab   IT++  a C++ library   R  similar to S PLUS  and certain variants of Python  Performance varies widely  while vector and matrix operations are usually fast  scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude   Many computer algebra systems such as Mathematica also benefit from the availability of arbitrary precision arithmetic which can provide more accurate results   Also  any spreadsheet software can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis   5  See also  Analysis of algorithms  Computational science  List of numerical analysis topics  Numerical differentiation  Numerical
