The Workers  and Peasants  Red Army    RKKA  frequently shortened in Russian to   KA  in English  Red Army   was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic  which after 1922 was called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution  Red October or Bolshevik Revolution   in which the Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations  especially the combined groups summarized under the preamble White Army  of their adversaries  during the Russian Civil War  Beginning in February 1946  the Red Army  along with the Soviet Navy  embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces  taking the official name  The Soviet Army      until its dissolution in December 1991   The Red Army is credited as being the decisive land force in the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War II  During operations on the Eastern Front  it defeated 75%–80% of the German land forces  Wehrmacht and Waffen SS  deployed in the war   1  Origins  In September 1917 Vladimir Lenin wrote   There is only one way to prevent the restoration of the police  and that is to create a people s militia and to fuse it with the army  the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the entire people    At the time  the Imperial Russian Army had started to collapse  23% about 19 million  of the male population of the Russian Empire were mobilized   however most of them were not equipped with any weapons and had support roles maintaining the lines of communication and the base areas  The Tsarist general Nikolay Dukhonin estimated that there were 2 million deserters  1 8 million dead  5 million wounded and 2 million prisoners  He estimated the remaining troops as numbering 10 million   The Council of People s Commissars decided to form the Red Army on 28 January 1918  They envisioned a body  formed from the class conscious and best elements of the working classes   All citizens of the Russian republic over the age of 18 were eligible  Its role being the defense  of the Soviet authority  the creation of a basis for the transformation of the standing army into a force deriving its strength from a nation in arms  and  furthermore  the creation of a basis for the support of the coming Socialist Revolution in Europe ”  Enlistment was conditional upon  guarantees being given by a military or civil committee functioning within the territory of the Soviet Power or by party or trade union committees or  in extreme cases  by two persons belonging to one of the above organizations   In the event of an entire unit wanting to join the Red Army  a  collective guarantee and the affirmative vote of all its members  would be necessary   The Council of People s Commissars appointed itself the supreme head of the Red Army  delegating command and administration of the Army to the Commissariat for Military Affairs and the Special All Russian College within this commissariat  Nikolai Krylenko was the Supreme Commander in Chief  with Aleksandr Myasnikyan as deputy  Nikolai Podvoisky became the Commissar for War  Pavel Dybenko Commissar for the Fleet  Proshyan  Samoisky  Steinberg were also specified as People s Commissars with Vladimir Bonch Bruyevich from the Bureau of Commissars  At a joint meeting of Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries  held on 22 February 1918  Krylenko remarked   We have no army  The demoralized soldiers are flying panic stricken as soon as they see a German helmet appear on the horizon  abandoning their artillery  convoys and all war material to the triumphantly advancing enemy  The Red Guard units are brushed aside like flies  We have no power to stay the enemy  only an immediate signing of the peace treaty will save us from destruction    While the Russian army was being taken apart   it became apparent that the rag tag Red Guard units and elements of the imperial army who had gone over the side of the Bolsheviks were quite inadequate to the task of defending the new government against external foes   Therefore  in January 1918  Sovnarkom decided that the Worker Peasant Red Army would consist of volunteers from  the most class conscious and organized elements of the toiling masses   This signalled the end of the Red Guards and the creation of the Red Army   Because the Red Army was composed mainly of peasants  the families of those who served were guaranteed rations and assistance with farm work  Some peasants who remained at home yearned to join the Army  men  along with some women  flooded the recruitment centres  If they were turned away they would collect scrap metal and prepare care packages  In some cases the money they earned would go towards tanks for the Army   2  History  2 1  Russian Civil War  The Russian Civil War  1917–23  occurred in two periods   The first period  October 1917 – November 1918  from the Bolshevik Revolution to the First World War  1914–18  Armistice  developed from the Bolshevik government s November 1917 nationalization of traditional Cossack lands  This provoked the insurrection of General Alexey Maximovich Kaledin s Volunteer Army in the River Don region  The Treaty of Brest Litovsk also aggravated Russian internal politics  This allowed direct Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War  in which twelve foreign countries created anti Bolshevik militias  There was a series of engagements between the Czechoslovak Legion  the Polish 5th Rifle Division  and the pro Bolshevik Red Latvian Riflemen  et al   The second period  January–November 1919  saw the White armies  successfully advancing  from the south  under Gen  Anton Denikin  from the east  under Gen  Aleksandr Vasilevich Kolchak  and from the northwest  under Gen  Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich  The Whites defeated the Red Army on each front  Leon Trotsky reformed and counterattacked  the Red Army repelled Gen  Kolchak s army in June  and the armies of Gen  Denikin and Gen  Yudenich in October  By mid November  the White Armies were all almost completely exhausted  and  in January 1920  Budenny s First Cavalry Army entered Rostov on Don  At the war s start  the Red Army consisted of 299 infantry regiments  Civil war intensified after Lenin dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly  5–6 January 1918  and the Soviet government signed the Treaty of Brest Litovsk  3 March 1918  removing Russia from the Great War  Free from international war  the Red Army confronted an internecine war with a loose alliance of anti Communist forces  comprising the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine  the  Black Army  led by Nestor Makhno  the anti White and anti Red Green armies  and others  The 23 February 1918  Red Army Day  has a twofold  historical significance  the first day of drafting recruits  in Petrograd and Moscow  and the first day of combat against the occupying Imperial German Army   On 6 September 1918 the Bolshevik militias consolidated under the supreme command of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic   People s Commissar for War  1918–24   Trotsky  Chairman  and Jukums Vācietis  Commander in Chief of the Red Army  Soon afterwards Trotsky established the GRU  military intelligence  to provide political and military intelligence to Red Army commanders  Trotsky founded the Red Army with an initial Red Guard organization  and a core soldiery of Red Guard militiamen and Chekist secret police  conscription began in June 1918  and opposition to it was violently suppressed  To control the multi ethnic and multi cultural Red Army soldiery  the Cheka operated special punitive brigades which suppressed anti communists  deserters  and  enemies of the state   Wartime pragmatism allowed the recruitment of ex Tsarist officers and sergeants  non commissioned officers  NCOs  to the Red Army  Lev Glezarov s special commission screened and recruited  by mid August 1920 the Red Army s former Tsarist personnel included 48 000 officers  10 300 administrators  and 214 000 NCOs  At the Civil War s start  ex Tsarists made up 75% of the Red Army officer corps  who were employed as voenspetsy  military specialists   ru Военный советник   whose loyalty was occasionally enforced with hostage families  At war s end in 1922  ex Tsarists constituted 83% of the Red Army s divisional and corps commanders   The Red Army used special regiments for ethnic minorities  like the Dungan Cavalry Regiment commanded by the Dungan Magaza Masanchi  The Red Army also co operated with armed Bolshevik Party oriented volunteer units  the Части особого назначения  ЧОН   chasti osobogo naznacheniya   special task units or ChON  which functioned from 1919 to 1925   The slogan  Exhortation  Organization  and Reprisals  expressed the discipline and motivation ensuring the Red Army s tactical and strategic success  On campaign  the attached Cheka Special Punitive Brigades conducted summary field courts martial and executions of deserters and slackers  Under Commissar Jānis K  Bērziņš the Special Punitive Brigades took hostages from the villages of deserters to compel their surrender  one in ten was executed  The same tactic also suppressed peasant rebellions in areas controlled by the Red Army  The Soviets enforced the loyalty of the political  ethnic  and national varieties of men in the Red Army through political commissars attached at the brigade and regiment levels and tasked with spying on commanders for political incorrectness  Despite such coercion  the political commissars whose Chekist detachments retreated or broke in the face of the enemy earned the death penalty  In August 1918  Trotsky authorized General Mikhail Tukhachevsky to place blocking units behind politically unreliable Red Army units  to shoot anyone who retreated without permission  In 1942  during the Great Patriotic War  1941–1945   Joseph Stalin reintroduced the policy  using penal battalions   2 2  Polish Soviet War & prelude  The Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919 occurred at the same time as the general Soviet move into the areas abandoned by the Ober Ost garrisons  This merged into the 1919–21 Polish Soviet war  in which the Red Army reached central Poland in 1920  but then suffered a defeat there  which put an end to the war  During the Polish Campaign the Red Army numbered some 6 5 million men  many of which the Army had difficulty supporting  around 581 000 in the two operational fronts  western and southwestern  Around 2 5 million men and woman were  immobilized in the interior  as part of reserve armies   2 3  Doctrinal development in the 1920s and 1930s  After four years of warfare  the Red Army s defeat of Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel in the south allowed the foundation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922  Historian John Erickson dates 1 February 1924  when Mikhail Frunze became head of the Red Army Staff  as the ascent of the General Staff  which dominated Soviet military planning and operations  By 1 October 1924 the Red Army s strength diminished to 530 000  List of Soviet Union divisions 1917–45 details the formations of the Red Army in that time   In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s  Soviet military theoreticians led by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky developed the Deep operations doctrine  a direct consequence of their Polish Soviet War and Russian Civil War experience  To achieve victory  deep operations comprehend simultaneous Corps  and Army size unit maneuvers of simultaneous parallel attacks throughout the depth of the enemy s ground forces  inducing catastrophic defensive failure  The deep battle doctrine relies upon aviation and armor advances in the hope that maneuver warfare offers quick  efficient  and decisive victory  Marshal Tukhachevsky said that aerial warfare must be  employed against targets beyond the range of infantry  artillery  and other arms  For maximum tactical effect aircraft should be employed en masse  concentrated in time and space  against targets of the highest tactical importance    Red Army Deep Operations were first formally expressed in the 1929 Field Regulations  and codified in the 1936 Provisional Field Regulations  PU 36   The Great Purge of 1937–1939 and Purge of 1940–1942 removed many leading officers from the Red Army  including Tukhachevsky and many of his followers  and the doctrine was abandoned  Thus at the Battle of Lake Khasan  in 1938  and the Battle of Khalkhin Gol  in 1939  major border clashes with the Imperial Japanese Army  the doctrine was not used  It was not until the Second World War that deep operations were to be reused   2 4  Chinese Soviet War  The Republic of China waged war against invading Soviet and White Russian forces during the Sino Soviet conflict  1929   the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang and the Xinjiang War  The Red Army achieved its objectives  it maintained effective control over the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway  and successfully installed a pro Soviet regime in Xinjiang   The XI Congress of the Russian Communist Party  Bolsheviks   RCP  b   adopted a resolution on the strengthening of the Red Army  It decided to establish strictly organized military  educational and economic conditions in the army  However it was recognized that an army of 1 600 000 would be burdensome  After the Congress  the Party Central Committee decided to reduce the Red Army by the end of 1922 to 800 thousand people  Reduction of the army necessitated the restructuring of management and organizational structure of troops  The supreme military unit became corps of two or three divisions  Divisions consisted of three regiments  Brigades as independent units were abolished  In the second half of 1922 began the formation of departments  rifle corps   2 5  The Winter War with Finland  The Winter War        was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland  It began with a Soviet offensive on 30 November 1939—three months after the start of World War II and the Soviet invasion of Poland  and ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty  The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939   The Soviet forces had three times as many soldiers as the Finns  thirty times as many aircraft  and a hundred times as many tanks  The Red Army  however  had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin s Great Purge of 1937  reducing the army s morale and efficiency shortly before the outbreak of the fighting  With over 30 000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned  most of which were of the highest ranks  the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior officers  Because of these factors  and high commitment and morale in the Finnish forces  Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for much longer than the Soviets expected  Finnish forces inflicted stunning losses on the Red Army for the first three to four months while suffering very few losses themselves   Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty  Finland ceded 11% of its pre war territory and 30% of its economic assets to the Soviet Union  Soviet losses on the front were heavy  and the country s international reputation suffered  The Soviet forces did not accomplish their objective of the total conquest of Finland but conquered sufficient territory along Lake Ladoga  Petsamo and Salla  The Finns retained their sovereignty and improved their international reputation  which increased the morale in the Continuation War    2 6  World War II   The Great Patriotic War    In accordance with the Soviet Nazi Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939  the Red Army invaded Poland on 17 September 1939  after the Nazi invasion on 1 September 1939  On 30 November  the Red Army also attacked Finland  in the Winter War of 1939–40  By autumn 1940  after conquering its portion of Poland  the Third Reich shared an extensive border with USSR  with whom it remained neutrally bound by their non aggression pact and trade agreements  Another consequence of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact was the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina  carried out by the Southern Front in June–July 1940  This conquest also added to the border the Soviet Union shared with Nazi controlled areas  For Adolf Hitler  the circumstance was no dilemma  because the Drang nach Osten   Drive towards the East   policy secretly remained in force  culminating on 18 December 1940 with Directive No  21  Operation Barbarossa  approved on 3 February 1941  and scheduled for mid May 1941   When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941  in Operation Barbarossa  the Red Army s ground forces had 303 divisions and 22 separate brigades  4 8 million soldiers   including 166 divisions and 9 brigades  2 9 million soldiers  garrisoned in the western military districts  The Axis deployed on the Eastern Front had 181 divisions and 18 brigades  5 5 million soldiers   Three Fronts  the Northwestern  Western  and Southwestern conducted the defense of the western borders of the USSR  In the first weeks of the Great Patriotic War the Wehrmacht defeated many Red Army units  The Red Army lost millions of men as prisoners and lost much of its pre war matériel  Stalin increased mobilization  and by 1 August 1941  despite 46 divisions lost in combat  the Red Army s strength was 401 divisions   The unprepared Soviet forces suffered much damage in the field because of mediocre officers  partial mobilization  and an incomplete reorganization  The hasty pre war forces expansion and the over promotion of inexperienced officers  owing to the purging of experienced officers  favored the Wehrmacht in combat  The Axis s numeric superiority rendered the combatants  divisional strength approximately equal  A generation of Soviet commanders  notably Georgy Zhukov  learned from the defeats  and Soviet victories in the Battle of Moscow  at Stalingrad  Kursk and later in Operation Bagration proved decisive   In 1941  the Soviet government raised the bloodied Red Army s esprit de corps with propaganda stressing the defense of Motherland and nation  employing historic exemplars of Russian courage and bravery against foreign aggressors  The anti Nazi Great Patriotic War  was conflated with the Patriotic War of 1812 against Napoleon  and historical Russian military heroes  such as Alexander Nevski and Mikhail Kutuzov  appeared  repression of the Russian Orthodox Church temporarily ceased  and priests revived the tradition of blessing arms before battle   To encourage the initiative of Red Army commanders  the CPSU temporarily abolished political commissars  reintroduced formal military ranks and decorations  and the Guards unit concept  Exceptionally heroic or high performing units earned the Guards title  for example 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps  6th Guards Tank Army   an elite designation denoting superior training  materiel  and pay  Punishment also was used  slackers and malingerers avoiding combat with self inflicted wounds cowards  thieves  and deserters were disciplined with beatings  demotions  undesirable dangerous duties  and summary execution by NKVD punitive detachments   In that time  the osobist  NKVD military counter intelligence officer  became a key Red Army figure with the power to condemn to death and to spare the life of any soldier and  most any  officer of the unit to which he was attached  In 1942  Stalin established the penal battalions composed of gulag inmates  Soviet PoWs  disgraced soldiers  and deserters  for hazardous front line duty as tramplers clearing Nazi minefields  et cetera  Given the dangers  the maximum sentence was three months  Likewise  the Soviet treatment of Red Army personnel captured by the Wehrmacht was especially harsh  A 1941 Stalin directive ordered the suicide of every Red Army officer and soldier rather than surrender  Soviet law regarded all captured Red Army soldiers as traitors  Soviet PoWs whom the Red Army liberated from enemy captivity usually were sentenced to penal battalions   During the Great Patriotic War  the Red Army conscripted 29 574 900 men in addition to the 4 826 907 in service at the beginning of the war  Of this total of 34 401 807 it lost 6 329 600 killed in action  KIA   555 400 deaths by disease and 4 559 000 missing in action  MIA   most captured   Of these 11 444 000  however  939 700 rejoined the ranks in the subsequently liberated Soviet territory  and a further 1 836 000 returned from German captivity  Thus the grand total of losses amounted to 8 668 400  This is the official total dead  but other estimates give the number of total dead up to almost 11 million men  including 7 7 million killed or missing in action and 2 6 million POW dead  out of 5 2 million total POWs   plus 400 000 paramilitary and Soviet partisan losses  The majority of the losses  excluding POWs  being ethnic Russians  5 756 000   followed by ethnic Ukrainians  1 377 400   However  as many as 8 million of the 34 million mobilized were non Slavic minority soldiers  and around 45 divisions formed from national minorities served from 1941 to 1943   The German losses on the Eastern Front consisted of an estimated 3 604 800 KIA within the 1937 borders plus 900 000 ethnic Germans and Austrians outside the 1937 border  included in these numbers are men listed as missing in action or unaccounted for after the war  and 3 576 300 men reported captured  total 8 081 100   the losses of the German satellites on the Eastern Front approximated 668 163 KIA MIA and 799 982 captured  total 1 468 145   Of these 9 549 245  the Soviets released 3 572 600 from captivity after the war  thus the grand total of the Axis losses came to an estimated 5 976 645  Regarding prisoners of war  both sides captured large numbers and had many die in captivity – one recent British figure says 3 6 of 6 million Soviet POWs died in German camps  while 300 000 of 3 million German POWs died in Soviet hands  From the fall of East Prussia  Soviet soldiers carried out large scale rapes in Germany  especially noted in Berlin until the beginning of May 1945   2 6 1  Shortcomings  In 1941 the rapid progress of the initial German air and land attacks into the Soviet Union made Red Army logistical support difficult  because many depots  and most of the USSR s industrial manufacturing base lay in the country s invaded western half  obliging their re establishment east of the Ural Mountains  Until then  the Red Army was often required to improvise or go without weapons  vehicles  and other equipment  The 1941 decision to physically move their manufacturing capacity east of the Ural mountains kept the main Soviet support system out of German reach   In the later stages of the war  the Red Army fielded some excellent weaponry  especially artillery and tanks  The Red Army s heavy KV 1 and medium T 34 tanks outclassed most Wehrmacht armor  but in 1941  most Soviet tank units used older models  The Soviet Air Force  though equipped with relatively modern aircraft  initially performed poorly against the Luftwaffe   3  Administration  Until the establishment of the Red Army  military administration after the October Revolution was taken over by the People s Commissariat of war and marine affairs headed by a collective committee of Vladimir Antonov Ovseyenko  Pavel Dybenko  and Nikolai Krylenko  At the same time Nikolay Dukhonin was acting as the Supreme Commander in Chief after Alexander Kerensky fled from Russia  On 12 November 1917 the Soviet government appointed Krylenko as the Supreme Commander in Chief and because of an  accident  during forceful displacement of commander in chief Dukhonin was killed on 20 November 1917  On 28 November 1917 Nikolai Podvoisky was appointed as the Narkom of War Affairs  leaving Dybenko in charge of Narkom of Marine Affairs and Ovseyenko   the expeditionary forces to the Southern Russia  Bolsheviks also sent out their own representative to replace front commanders of the Russian Imperial Army   After the signing of Treaty of Brest Litovsk on 3 March 1918  a major reshuffling took place in the Soviet military administration  On 13 March 1918 the Soviet government accepted the official resignation of Krylenko and the post of Supreme Commander in Chief was liquidated  On 14 March 1918 Leon Trotsky replaced Podvoisky as the Narkom of War Affairs  On 16 March 1918 Pavel Dybenko was relieved from the office of Narkom of Marine Affairs  On 8 May 1918 there was created the All Russian Chief Headquarters headed by Nikolai Stogov and later Alexander Svechin   On 2 September 1918 there was established the Revolutionary Military Council  RMC  as the main military administration that was governed by the Narkom of War Affairs Leon Trotsky  On 6 September 1918 along with already existing chief headquarters  there was created the Field Headquarters of RMC initially headed by Nikolai Rattel  The same day there was created office of the Commander in Chief of Armed Forces initially assigned to Jukums Vācietis  since July 1919   Sergey Kamenev   The Commander in Chief of Armed Forces existed until April 1924  the end of Russian Civil War   After the establishment of the Soviet Union  in November 1923 Russian Narkom of War Affairs was transformed into the Soviet Narkom of War and Marine Affairs   4  Organization  At the beginning of its existence  the Red Army functioned as a voluntary formation  without ranks or insignia  Democratic elections selected the officers  However  a decree of 29 May 1918 imposed obligatory military service for men of ages 18 to 40  To service the massive draft  the Bolsheviks formed regional military commissariats  voyennyy komissariat  abbr  voyenkomat   which as of 2006 still exist in Russia in this function and under this name  Military commissariats however should not be confused with the institution of military political commissars   In the mid 1920s the territorial principle of manning the Red Army was introduced  In each region able bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in territorial units  which constituted about half the army s strength  each year  for five years  The first call up period was for three months  with one month a year thereafter  A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus  By 1925 this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions  The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two year terms  The territorial system was finally abolished  with all remaining formations converted to the other cadre divisions  in 1937–38   4 1  Mechanization  The Soviet military received ample funding and was innovative in its technology  An American journalist wrote in 1941   Under Stalin s campaign for mechanization  the army formed its first mechanized unit in 1930  The 1st Mechanized Brigade  consisting of a tank regiment  a motorized infantry regiment  and reconnaissance and artillery battalions  From this humble beginning  the Soviets would go on to create the first operational level armored formations in history  the 11th and 45th Mechanized Corps  in 1932  These were tank heavy formations with combat support forces included so they could survive while operating in enemy rear areas without support from a parent front   Impressed by the German campaign of 1940 against France  the Soviet People s Commissariat of Defence  Defence Ministry  Russian abbreviation NKO  ordered the creation of nine mechanized corps on 6 July 1940  Between February and March 1941 another twenty would be ordered  and all larger than those of Tukhachevsky  Even though the Red Army s 29 mechanized corps had no less than 29 899 tanks on paper by 1941  they proved to be a paper tiger  There were actually only 17 000 tanks available at the time  meaning several of the new mechanized corps were under strength  The pressure placed on factories and military planners to show production numbers also led to a situation where the majority of armored vehicles were obsolescent models  critically lacking in spare parts and support equipment  and nearly three quarters were overdue for major maintenance  By 22 June 1941 there were only 1 475 T 34s and KV series tanks available to the Red Army  and these were too dispersed along the front to provide enough mass for even local success  To put this into perspective  the 3rd Mechanized Corps in Lithuania was formed up of a total of 460 tanks  109 of these were newer KV 1s and T 34s  This corps would prove to be one of the lucky few with a substantial number of newer tanks  However  the 4th Army was composed of 520 tanks  all of which were the obsolete T 26  as opposed to the authorized strength of 1 031 newer medium tanks  This problem was universal throughout the Red Army  This fact would play a crucial role in the initial defeats of the Red Army in 1941 at the hands of the German armed forces   4 2  Wartime  War experience prompted changes to the way frontline forces were organized  After six months of combat against the Germans  the stavka abolished the rifle corps intermediate level between the army and division level because  while useful in theory  in the state of the Red Army in 1941  they proved ineffective in practice  Following the decisive victory in the Battle of Moscow in January 1942  the high command began to reintroduce rifle corps into its most experienced formations  The total number of rifle corps started at 62 on 22 June 1941  dropped to six by 1 January 1942  but then increased to 34 by February 1943  and 161 by New Year s Day 1944  Actual strengths of front line rifle divisions  authorized to contain 11 000 men in July 1941  were mostly no more than 50% of established strengths during 1941  and divisions were often worn down on continuous operations to hundreds of men or even less   On the outbreak of war the Red Army deployed mechanized corps and tank divisions whose development has been described above  The German attack caused many  and in the course of 1941 virtually all  barring two in the Transbaikal Military District  were disbanded  It was much easier to coordinate smaller forces  and separate tank brigades and battalions were substituted  It was late 1942 and early 1943 before larger tank formations of corps size were fielded to employ armor in mass again  By mid 1942 these corps were being grouped together into tank armies whose strength by the end of the war could be up to 700 tanks and 50 000 men   5  Personnel  The Bolshevik authorities assigned to every unit of the Red Army a political commissar  or politruk  who had the authority to override unit commanders  decisions if they ran counter to the principles of the Communist Party  Although this sometimes resulted in inefficient command according to some American historians  the Party leadership considered political control over the military absolutely necessary  as the army relied more and more on officers from the pre revolutionary Imperial period and understandably feared a military coup  This system was abolished in 1925  as there were by that time enough trained Communist officers that counter signing of all orders was no longer necessary   5 1  Ranks and Titles  The early Red Army abandoned the institution of a professional officer corps as a  heritage of tsarism  in the course of the Revolution  In particular  the Bolsheviks condemned the use of the word officer and used the word commander instead  The Red Army abandoned epaulettes and ranks  using purely functional titles such as  Division Commander    Corps Commander   and similar titles  But insignia of these functional titles exists  consisting triangles  squares and rhombuses  so called  diamonds     In 1924  2 October   personal  or  service  categories introduced  from K1  section leader  assistant squad leader  senior rifleman  etc   to K14  field commander  army commander  military district commander  army commisar and equal   Service kategories insignia also consists triangles  squares and rhombuses  but also rectangles  1   3  for categories from K7 to K9    On 22 September 1935 the Red Army abandoned service categories and introduced personal ranks  These ranks  however  used a unique mix of functional titles and traditional ranks  For example  the ranks included  Lieutenant  and  Comdiv   Комдив  Division Commander   Further complications ensued from the functional and categorical ranks for political officers  e g    brigade commissar    army commissar 2nd rank    for technical corps  e g    engineer 3rd rank    division engineer    for administrative  medical and other non combatant branches   The Marshal of the Soviet Union  Маршал Советского Союза  rank was introduced on 22 September 1935  On 7 May 1940 further modifications to rationalise the ranks system were made on the proposal by Marshal Voroshilov  the ranks of  General  and  Admiral  replaced the senior functional ranks of Combrig  Comdiv  Comcor  Comandarm in the RKKA and Flagman 1st rank etc  in the Red Navy  the other senior functional ranks   division commissar    division engineer   etc   remained unaffected  The arm or service distinctions remained  e g  general of cavalry  marshal of armoured troops   For the most part the new system restored that used by the Imperial Russian Army at the conclusion of its participation in World War I   In early 1943 a unification of the system saw the abolition of all the remaining functional ranks  The word  officer  became officially endorsed  together with the epaulettes that superseded the previous rank insignia  The ranks and insignia of 1943 did not change much until the last days of the USSR  the contemporary Russian Army uses largely the same system   5 2  Military education  During the Civil War the commander cadres were trained at the Nicholas General Staff Academy of the Russian Empire  which became the Frunze Military Academy in the 1920s  Senior and supreme commanders were trained at the Higher Military Academic Courses  renamed the Advanced Courses for Supreme Command in 1925  the 1931 establishment of an Operations Faculty at the Frunze Military Academy supplemented these courses  The General Staff Academy was reinstated on 2 April 1936  and became the principal military school for the senior and supreme commanders of the Red Army   5 3  Purges  The late 1930s saw the purges of the Red Army leadership which occurred concurrently with Stalin s Great Purge of Soviet society  In 1936 and 1937  at the orders of Stalin  thousands of Red Army senior officers were dismissed from their commands  The purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the  politically unreliable elements   mainly among higher ranking officers  This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for the settling of personal vendettas or to eliminate competition by officers seeking the same command  Many army  corps  and divisional commanders were sacked  most were imprisoned or sent to labor camps  others were executed  Among the victims was the Red Army s primary military theorist  Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky  perceived by Stalin as a potential political rival  Officers who remained soon found all of their decisions being closely examined by political officers  even in mundane matters such as record keeping and field training exercises  An atmosphere of fear and unwillingness to take the initiative soon pervaded the Red Army  suicide rates among junior officers rose to record levels  The purges significantly impaired the combat capabilities of the Red Army  Hoyt concludes  the Soviet defense system was damaged to the point of incompetence  and stresses  the fear in which high officers lived   Clark says    Stalin not only cut the heart out of the army  he also gave it brain damage   Lewin identifies three serious results  The loss of experienced and well trained senior officers  the distrust it caused among potential allies especially France  and the encouragement it gave Germany   Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937  at the height of the Purges  the Red Army had 114 300 officers  of whom 11 034 were dismissed  In 1938  the Red Army had 179 000 officers  56% more than in 1937  of whom a further 6 742 were sacked  In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals  13 of 15 army generals  8 of 9 admirals  50 of 57 army corps generals  154 out of 186 division generals  all 16 army commissars  and 25 of 28 army corps commissars   The result was that the Red Army officer corps in 1941 had many inexperienced senior officers  While 60% of regimental commanders had two years or more of command experience in June 1941  and almost 80% of rifle division commanders  only 20% of corps commanders  and 5% or fewer army and military district commanders  had the same level of experience   The significant growth of the Red Army during the high point of the purges may have worsened matters  In 1937  the Red Army numbered around 1 3 million  increasing to almost three times that number by June 1941  The rapid growth of the army necessitated in turn the rapid promotion of officers regardless of experience or training  Junior officers were appointed to fill the ranks of the senior leadership  many of whom lacked broad experience  This action in turn resulted in many openings at the lower level of the officer corps  which were filled by new graduates from the service academies  In 1937  the entire junior class of one academy was graduated a year early to fill vacancies in the Red Army  Hamstrung by inexperience and fear of reprisals  many of these new officers failed to impress the large numbers of incoming draftees to the ranks  complaints of insubordination rose to the top of offenses punished in 1941  and may have exacerbated instances of Red Army soldiers deserting their units during the initial phases of the German offensive of that year   By 1940  Stalin began to relent  restoring approximately one third of previously dismissed officers to duty  However  the effect of the purges would soon manifest itself in the Winter War of 1940  where Red Army forces generally performed poorly against the much smaller Finnish Army  and later during the German invasion of 1941  in which the German were able to rout the Russians defenders partially due to inexperience amongst the Russian officers   6  Weapons and equipment  The Soviet Union expanded its indigenous arms industry as part of Stalin s industrialization program in the 1920s and 1930s   7  Notes  8  References  9  Bibliography  Carrere D Encausse  Helene  The End of the Soviet Empire  The Triumph of the Nations  Basic Books  1992
