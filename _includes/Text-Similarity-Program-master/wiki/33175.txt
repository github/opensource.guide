William Blake  28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827  was an English painter  poet and printmaker  Largely unrecognised during his lifetime  Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age  His prophetic poetry has been said to form  what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language   His visual artistry led one contemporary art critic to proclaim him  far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced   In 2002  Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons  Although he lived in London his entire life  except for three years spent in Felpham   he produced a diverse and symbolically rich oeuvre  which embraced the imagination as  the body of God  or  human existence itself    Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views  he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity  and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work  His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as  Pre Romantic   Reverent of the Bible but hostile to the Church of England  indeed  to all forms of organised religion   Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American Revolutions  Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs  he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine  he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg  Despite these known influences  the singularity of Blake s work makes him difficult to classify  The 19th century scholar William Rossetti characterised him as a  glorious luminary   and  a man not forestalled by predecessors  nor to be classed with contemporaries  nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors    1  Early life  William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street  now Broadwick St   in Soho  London  He was the third of seven children  two of whom died in infancy  Blake s father  James  was a hosier  He attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing  leaving at the age of ten  and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Wright Armitage Blake  Even though the Blakes were English Dissenters  William was baptised on 11 December at St James s Church  Piccadilly  London  The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake  and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life   Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father  a practice that was preferred to actual drawing  Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael  Michelangelo  Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer  The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed  at least for a time  a comfortable wealth  When William was ten years old  his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars s drawing school in the Strand  He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing  During this period  Blake made explorations into poetry  his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson  Edmund Spenser  and the Psalms   1 1  Apprenticeship to Basire  On 4 August 1772  Blake was apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street  at the sum of £52 10  for a term of seven years  At the end of the term  aged 21  he became a professional engraver  No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake s apprenticeship  but Peter Ackroyd s biography notes that Blake later added Basire s name to a list of artistic adversaries – and then crossed it out  This aside  Basire s style of line engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old fashioned compared to the flashier stipple or mezzotint styles  It has been speculated that Blake s instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life   After two years  Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London  perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker  his fellow apprentice   His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas  The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour  painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks  Ackroyd notes that     the most immediate  impression  would have been of faded brightness and colour   This close study of the Gothic  which he saw as the  living form   left clear traces in his style  In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey  he was occasionally interrupted by boys from Westminster School  who were allowed in the Abbey  They teased him and one tormented him so much that James knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground   upon which he fell with terrific Violence   After James complained to the Dean  the schoolboys  privilege was withdrawn  Blake experienced visions in the Abbey  he saw Christ and his Apostles and a great procession of monks and priests and heard their chant   1 2  Royal Academy  On 8 October 1779  Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House  near the Strand  While the terms of his study required no payment  he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six year period  There  he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens  championed by the school s first president  Joshua Reynolds  Over time  Blake came to detest Reynolds  attitude towards art  especially his pursuit of  general truth  and  general beauty   Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that the  disposition to abstractions  to generalising and classification  is the great glory of the human mind   Blake responded  in marginalia to his personal copy  that  To Generalize is to be an Idiot  To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit   Blake also disliked Reynolds  apparent humility  which he held to be a form of hypocrisy  Against Reynolds  fashionable oil painting  Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences  Michelangelo and Raphael   David Bindman suggests that Blake s antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the president s opinions  like Blake  Reynolds held history painting to be of greater value than landscape and portraiture   but rather  against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice   Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy  submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808   Blake became a friend of John Flaxman  Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy  They shared radical views  with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information   1 3  Gordon Riots  Blake s first biographer  Alexander Gilchrist  records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basire s shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison  The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes  set the building ablaze  and released the prisoners inside  Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack  The riots  in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism  became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III  and the creation of the first police force   Despite Gilchrist s insistence that Blake was  forced  to accompany the crowd  some biographers have argued that he accompanied it impulsively  or supported it as a revolutionary act  In contrast  Jerome McGann argues that the riots were reactionary  and that events would have provoked  disgust  in Blake   1 4  Marriage and early career  Blake met Catherine Boucher in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal  He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents  after which he asked Catherine   Do you pity me   When she responded affirmatively  he declared   Then I love you   Blake married Catherine – who was five years his junior – on 18 August 1782 in St Mary s Church  Battersea  Illiterate  Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X  The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church  where a commemorative stained glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982  Later  in addition to teaching Catherine to read and write  Blake trained her as an engraver  Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid  helping to print his illuminated works and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes   Blake s first collection of poems  Poetical Sketches  was printed around 1783  After his father s death  Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784  and began working with radical publisher Joseph Johnson  Johnson s house was a meeting place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time  theologian and scientist Joseph Priestley  philosopher Richard Price  artist John Henry Fuseli  early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and Anglo American revolutionary Thomas Paine  Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin  Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries  but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France  In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript An Island in the Moon   Blake illustrated Original Stories from Real Life  2nd edition  1791  by Mary Wollstonecraft  They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage  but there is no evidence proving without doubt that they actually met  In 1793 s Visions of the Daughters of Albion  Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self fulfilment   From 1790 to 1800 William Blake lived in North Lambeth  London  at 13 Hercules Buildings  Hercules Road  The property was demolished in 1918  but the site is now marked with a plaque  There is a series of 70 mosaics inspired by Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of Waterloo Station   1 5  Relief etching  In 1788  aged 31  Blake experimented with relief etching  a method he used to produce most of his books  paintings  pamphlets and poems  The process is also referred to as illuminated printing  and the finished products as illuminated books or prints  Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes  using an acid resistant medium  Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts  He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief  hence the name    This is a reversal of the usual method of etching  where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid  and the plate printed by the intaglio method  Relief etching  which Blake referred to as  stereotype  in The Ghost of Abel  was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio  Stereotype  a process invented in 1725  consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving  but Blake s innovation was  as described above  very different  The pages printed from these plates were hand coloured in water colours and stitched together to form a volume  Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well known works  including Songs of Innocence and of Experience  The Book of Thel  The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Jerusalem   1 6  Engravings  Although Blake has become most famous for his relief etching  his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving  the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate  a complex and laborious process  with plates taking months or years to complete  but as Blake s contemporary  John Boydell  realised  such engraving offered a  missing link with commerce   enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century   Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work  most notably for the illustrations of the Book of Job  completed just before his death  Most critical work has concentrated on Blake s relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art  but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake s surviving plates  including those for the Book of Job  they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as  repoussage   a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate  Such techniques  typical of engraving work of the time  are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching  and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete   2  Later life and career  Blake s marriage to Catherine was close and devoted until his death  Blake taught Catherine to write  and she helped him colour his printed poems  Gilchrist refers to  stormy times  in the early years of the marriage  Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a concubine into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the Swedenborgian Society  but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture  William and Catherine s first daughter and last child might be Thel described in The Book of Thel who was conceived as dead   2 1  Felpham  In 1800  Blake moved to a cottage at Felpham  in Sussex  now West Sussex   to take up a job illustrating the works of William Hayley  a minor poet  It was in this cottage that Blake began Milton  the title page is dated 1804  but Blake continued to work on it until 1808   The preface to this work includes a poem beginning  And did those feet in ancient time   which became the words for the anthem  Jerusalem   Over time  Blake began to resent his new patron  believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry  and preoccupied with  the meer drudgery of business   E724   Blake s disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced Milton  a Poem  in which Blake wrote that  Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies    4 26  E98   Blake s trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803  when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier  John Schofield  Blake was charged not only with assault  but with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the king  Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed  Damn the king  The soldiers are all slaves   Blake was cleared in the Chichester assizes of the charges  According to a report in the Sussex county paper    T he invented character of  the evidence  was     so obvious that an acquittal resulted   Schofield was later depicted wearing  mind forged manacles  in an illustration to Jerusalem   2 2  Return to London  Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate Jerusalem  1804–20   his most ambitious work  Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucer s Canterbury Tales  Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek  with a view to marketing an engraving  Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work  Cromek promptly commissioned Blake s friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept  When Blake learned he had been cheated  he broke off contact with Stothard  He set up an independent exhibition in his brother s haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho  The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration  titled The Canterbury Pilgrims   along with other works  As a result  he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue  1809   which contains what Anthony Blunt called a  brilliant analysis  of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism  It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings  The exhibition was very poorly attended  selling none of the temperas or watercolours  Its only review  in The Examiner  was hostile   Also around this time  circa 1808   Blake gave vigorous expression of views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the Discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds  denouncing the British Academy as a fraud and proclaiming   To Generalize is to be an Idiot    In 1818 he was introduced by George Cumberland s son to a young artist named John Linnell  A blue plaque commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes  at North End  Hampstead  Through Linnell he met Samuel Palmer  who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the Shoreham Ancients  The group shared Blake s rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age  Aged 65  Blake began work on illustrations for the Book of Job  later admired by Ruskin  who compared Blake favourably to Rembrandt  and by Vaughan Williams  who based his ballet Job  A Masque for Dancing on a selection of the illustrations   In later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works  particularly his Bible illustrations  to Thomas Butts  a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit  this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life   2 2 1  Dante s Divine Comedy  The commission for Dante s Divine Comedy came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell  with the aim of producing a series of engravings  Blake s death in 1827 cut short the enterprise  and only a handful of watercolours were completed  with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form  Even so  they have evoked praise   Blake s illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works  but rather seem to critically revise  or furnish commentary on  certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text   Because the project was never completed  Blake s intent may be obscured  Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake s illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany  In the margin of Homer Bearing the Sword and His Companions  Blake notes   Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost   Blake seems to dissent from Dante s admiration of the poetic works of ancient Greece  and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell  as evidenced by the grim humour of the cantos    At the same time  Blake shared Dante s distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power  and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante s work pictorially  Even as he seemed to near death  Blake s central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante s Inferno  he is said to have spent one of the very last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching   2 2 2  Death  Blakes s last years were spent at Fountain Court off the Strand  the property was demolished in the 1880s  when the Savoy Hotel was built   On the day of his death  Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series  Eventually  it is reported  he ceased working and turned to his wife  who was in tears by his bedside  Beholding her  Blake is said to have cried   Stay Kate  Keep just as you are – I will draw your portrait – for you have ever been an angel to me   Having completed this portrait  now lost   Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses  At six that evening  after promising his wife that he would be with her always  Blake died  Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house  present at his expiration  said   I have been at the death  not of a man  but of a blessed angel    George Richmond gives the following account of Blake s death in a letter to Samuel Palmer   Catherine paid for Blake s funeral with money lent to her by Linnell  He was buried five days after his death – on the eve of his 45th wedding anniversary – at the Dissenter s burial ground in Bunhill Fields  where his parents were interred  Present at the ceremonies were Catherine  Edward Calvert  George Richmond  Frederick Tatham and John Linnell  Following Blake s death  Catherine moved into Tatham s house as a housekeeper  She believed she was regularly visited by Blake s spirit  She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings  but entertained no business transaction without first  consulting Mr  Blake   On the day of her death  in October 1831  she was as calm and cheerful as her husband  and called out to him  as if he were only in the next room  to say she was coming to him  and it would not be long now    On her death  Blake s manuscripts were inherited by Frederick Tatham  who burned some he deemed heretical or politically radical  Tatham was an Irvingite  one of the many fundamentalist movements of the 19th century  and opposed to any work that smacked of blasphemy  John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blake s drawings   Since 1965  the exact location of William Blake s grave had been lost and forgotten as gravestones were taken away to create a lawn  Blake’s grave is commemorated by a stone that reads  Near by lie the remains of the poet painter William Blake 1757–1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762–1831   The memorial stone is situated approximately 20 metres away from the actual grave  which is not marked  Members of the group Friends of William Blake have rediscovered the location and intend to place a permanent memorial at the site   Blake is recognised as a saint in the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica  The Blake Prize for Religious Art was established in his honour in Australia in 1949  In 1957 a memorial to Blake and his wife was erected in Westminster Abbey   3  Politics  Blake was not active in any well established political party  His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman s large study Blake  Prophet Against Empire  A Poet s Interpretation of the History of His Own Times  Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the Industrial Revolution  Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions  Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them  believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery  and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing  free love  have had their anti slavery implications short changed  A more recent  and very short  study  William Blake  Visionary Anarchist by Peter Marshall  1988   classified Blake and his contemporary William Godwin as forerunners of modern anarchism  British Marxist historian E  P  Thompson s last finished work  Witness Against the Beast  William Blake and the Moral Law  1993   shows how far he was inspired by dissident religious ideas rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English Civil War   4  Development of Blake s views  Because Blake s later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism  his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work  The Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses heavily on the earlier work  as do many critical studies such as William Blake by D  G  Gillham   The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  in which the figure represented by the  Devil  is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity  In later works  such as Milton and Jerusalem  Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self sacrifice and forgiveness  while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion  Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake s earlier and later works   Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake s late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works  namely  the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit  The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study The Unholy Bible suggests the later works are the  Bible of Hell  promised in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  Regarding Blake s final poem  Jerusalem   she writes    T he promise of the divine in man  made in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  is at last fulfilled    John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between Marriage and the late works  in that while the early Blake focused on a  sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason   the later Blake emphasised the notions of self sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness  This renunciation of the sharper dualism of Marriage of Heaven and Hell is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of Urizen in the later works  Murry characterises the later Blake as having found  mutual understanding  and  mutual forgiveness    5  Sexuality  5 1  19th century  free love  movement  Since his death  William Blake has been claimed by those of various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them  In particular  Blake is sometimes considered  along with Mary Wollstonecraft and her husband William Godwin  a forerunner of the 19th century  free love  movement  a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery  and advocated the removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality  prostitution  and adultery  culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century  Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today  although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsjö who moderately challenges this interpretation  The 19th century  free love  movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners  but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state sanctioned marriage was  legal prostitution  and monopolistic in character  It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements  particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft  whom Blake admired    Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day  and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue  At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage  in part due to Catherine s apparent inability to bear children  he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house  His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection  and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws  Poems such as  Why should I be bound to thee  O my lovely Myrtle tree   and  Earth s Answer  seem to advocate multiple sexual partners  In his poem  London  he speaks of  the Marriage Hearse  plagued by  the youthful Harlot s curse   the result alternately of false Prudence and or Harlotry  Visions of the Daughters of Albion is widely  though not universally  read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love  For Blake  law and love are opposed  and he castigates the  frozen marriage bed   In Visions  Blake writes   Till she who burns with youth  and knows no fixed lot  is bound In spells of law to one she loathes  and must she drag the chain Of life in weary lust   5 21 3  E49  In the 19th century  poet and free love advocate Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises  sacred natural love  that is not bound by another s possessive jealousy  the latter characterised by Blake as a  creeping skeleton   Swinburne notes how Blake s Marriage of Heaven and Hell condemns the hypocrisy of the  pale religious letchery  of advocates of traditional norms  Another 19th century free love advocate  Edward Carpenter  1844–1929   was influenced by Blake s mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions   In the early 20th century  Pierre Berger described how Blake s views echo Mary Wollstonecraft s celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty  the former being the true measure of purity  Irene Langridge notes that  in Blake s mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of  the soul    Michael Davis s 1977 book William Blake a New Kind of Man suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity  condemning him to a frozen death   As a theological writer  Blake has a sense of human  fallenness   S  Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature  not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men  but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication  Thomas Wright s 1928 book Life of William Blake  entirely devoted to Blake s doctrine of free love  notes that Blake thinks marriage should in practice afford the joy of love  but notes that in reality it often does not  as a couple s knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy  Pierre Berger also analyses Blake s early mythological poems such as Ahania as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity  as these are born from pride and jealousy   Some scholars have noted that Blake s views on  free love  are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years  Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as The Sick Rose  Magnus Ankarsjö notes that while the hero of Visions of the Daughters of Albion is a strong advocate of free love  by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown  crying  Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water   Ankarsjö also notes that a major inspiration to Blake  Mary Wollstonecraft  similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life  In light of Blake s aforementioned sense of human  fallenness  Ankarsjö thinks Blake does not fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha  since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained  Ankarsjö records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners  though David Worrall read The Book of Thel as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church   Blake s later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity  and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure  there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems  and there is advocacy of  self denial   though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion  Berger  more so than Swinburne  is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake  Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses  and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self  Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems  most notably in Blake s denial of the virginity of Jesus s mother   However  the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness  redemption  and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships   6  Religious views  Although Blake s attacks on conventional religion were shocking in his own day  his rejection of religiosity was not a rejection of religion per se  His view of orthodoxy is evident in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  a series of texts written in imitation of Biblical prophecy  Therein  Blake lists several Proverbs of Hell  among which are the following   Prisons are built with stones of Law  Brothels with bricks of Religion   As the chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on  so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys   8 21  9 55  E36  In The Everlasting Gospel  Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure  but as a supremely creative being  above dogma  logic and even morality   If he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus  He d have done anything to please us  Gone sneaking into Synagogues And not us d the Elders & Priests like Dogs  But humble as a Lamb or Ass  Obey d himself to Caiaphas  God wants not Man to Humble himself  55–61  E519 20  Jesus  for Blake  symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity   All had originally one language  and one religion  this was the religion of Jesus  the everlasting Gospel  Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus    Descriptive Catalogue  Plate 39  E543   Blake designed his own mythology  which appears largely in his prophetic books  Within these he describes a number of characters  including  Urizen    Enitharmon    Bromion  and  Luvah   His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology  and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel   One of Blake s strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy  In A Vision of the Last Judgment  Blake says that   His words concerning religion in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell   All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors  But the following Contraries to these are True  Blake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul  but sees the body as an extension of the soul  derived from the  discernment  of the senses  Thus  the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul  Elsewhere  he describes Satan as the  state of error   and as beyond salvation   Blake opposed the sophistry of theological thought that excuses pain  admits evil and apologises for injustice  He abhorred self denial  which he associated with religious repression and particularly sexual repression   Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity    He who desires but acts not  breeds pestilence    7 4–5  E35  He saw the concept of  sin  as a trap to bind men s desires  the briars of Garden of Love   and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life   Abstinence sows sand all over The ruddy limbs & flaming hair But Desire Gratified Plants fruits & beauty there   E474  He did not hold with the doctrine of God as Lord  an entity separate from and superior to mankind  this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ   He is the only God     and so am I  and so are you   A telling phrase in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is  men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast   This is very much in line with his belief in liberty and social equality in society and between the sexes   6 1  Enlightenment philosophy  Blake had a complex relationship with Enlightenment philosophy  Due to his visionary religious beliefs  he opposed the Newtonian view of the universe  This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blake s Jerusalem   I turn my eyes to the Schools & Universities of Europe And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire Washd by the Water wheels of Newton  black the cloth In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation  cruel Works Of many Wheels I view  wheel without wheel  with cogs tyrannic Moving by compulsion each other  not as those in Eden  which Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony & peace   15 14–20  E159  Blake believed the paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds  which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects  were products entirely of the  vegetative eye   and he saw Locke and Newton as  the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds  aesthetic   The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with mezzotints  prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page  Blake saw an analogy between this and Newton s particle theory of light  Accordingly  Blake never used the technique  opting rather to develop a method of engraving purely in fluid line  insisting that   It has been supposed that  despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles  Blake arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the Neoclassical engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics  with whom he is often classified  However  Blake s relationship with Flaxman seems to have grown more distant after Blake s return from Felpham  and there are surviving letters between Flaxman and Hayley wherein Flaxman speaks ill of Blake s theories of art  Blake further criticized Flaxman s styles and theories of art in his responses to criticism made against his print of Chaucer s Caunterbury Pilgrims in 1810   7  Assessment  7 1  Creative mindset  Northrop Frye  commenting on Blake s consistency in strongly held views  notes Blake  himself says that his notes on  Joshua  Reynolds  written at fifty  are  exactly Similar  to those on Locke and Bacon  written when he was  very Young   Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later  Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles     Consistency  then  foolish or otherwise  is one of Blake s chief preoccupations  just as  self contradiction  is always one of his most contemptuous comments    Blake abhorred slavery and believed in racial and sexual equality  Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity   As all men are alike  tho  infinitely various    In one poem  narrated by a black child  white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds  which exist only until one learns  to bear the beams of love    When I from black and he from white cloud free  And round the tent of God like lambs we joy  Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear  To lean in joy upon our fathers knee  And then I ll stand and stroke his silver hair  And be like him and he will then love me   23 8  E9  Blake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life  and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism  His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church  His spiritual beliefs are evident in Songs of Experience  1794   in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God  whose restrictions he rejected  and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence   7 2  Visions  From a young age  William Blake claimed to have seen visions  The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when  according to one anecdote  the young artist  saw God  when God  put his head to the window   causing Blake to break into screaming  At the age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye  London  Blake claimed to have seen  a tree filled with angels  bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars   According to Blake s Victorian biographer Gilchrist  he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother  Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive  his mother seems to have been especially so  and several of Blake s early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber  On another occasion  Blake watched haymakers at work  and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them   Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life  They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery  and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits  Certainly  religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake s works  God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings  from which he drew inspiration  Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works  which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels  In a letter of condolence to William Hayley  dated 6 May 1800  four days after the death of Hayley s son  Blake wrote   In a letter to John Flaxman  dated 21 September 1800  Blake wrote   In a letter to Thomas Butts  dated 25 April 1803  Blake wrote   In A Vision of the Last Judgement Blake wrote   Aware of Blake s visions  William Wordsworth commented   There was no doubt that this poor man was mad  but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott   In a more deferential vein  writing in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature  John William Cousins wrote that Blake was  a truly pious and loving soul  neglected and misunderstood by the world  but appreciated by an elect few   who  led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations    Blake s sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica  whose entry on Blake comments that  The question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute  but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account  and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence     8  Cultural influence  Blake s work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten when Alexander Gilchrist began work on his biography in the 1860s  The publication of the Life of William Blake rapidly transformed Blake s reputation  in particular as he was taken up by Pre Raphaelites and associated figures  in particular Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne  In the twentieth century  however  Blake s work was fully appreciated and his influence increased  Important early and mid twentieth century scholars involved in enhancing Blake s standing in literary and artistic circles included S  Foster Damon  Geoffrey Keynes  Northrop Frye  David V  Erdman and G  E  Bentley  Jr   While Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti  it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists  William Butler Yeats  who edited an edition of Blake s collected works in 1893  drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas  while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake s conceptions of non mimetic  visionary practice in the painting of artists such as Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland  His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams  who set his works  Modern British composer John Tavener set several of Blake s poems  including The Lamb  as the 1982 work  The Lamb   and The Tyger   Many such as June Singer have argued that Blake s thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung  although Jung dismissed Blake s works as  an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes   Similarly  although less popularly  Diana Hume George claimed that Blake can be seen as a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud   Blake had an enormous influence on the beat poets of the 1950s and the counterculture of the 1960s  frequently being cited by such seminal figures as beat poet Allen Ginsberg  songwriters Bob Dylan  Jim Morrison  Van Morrison  and English writer Aldous Huxley  Much of the central conceit of Philip Pullman s fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials is rooted in the world of Blake s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  After World War II  Blake s role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music  film  and the graphic novel  leading Edward Larrissy to assert that  Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century    9  Exhibitions  Future exhibitions
