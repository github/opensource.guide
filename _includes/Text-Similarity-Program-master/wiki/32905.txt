West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States  It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast  Kentucky to the southwest  Ohio to the northwest  Pennsylvania to the north  and  slightly  east   and Maryland to the northeast  West Virginia is the 41st largest by area and the 38th most populous of the 50 United States  The capital and largest city is Charleston   West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861  in which 50 northwestern counties of Virginia decided to break away from Virginia during the American Civil War  The new state was admitted to the Union on June 20  1863  and was a key Civil War border state  West Virginia was the only state to form by seceding from a Confederate state and was one of two states formed during the American Civil War  the other being Nevada  which separated from Utah Territory    The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the South  The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio  with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area  while Bluefield is less than from North Carolina  Huntington in the southwest is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky  while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry in the Eastern Panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area  in between the states of Maryland and Virginia  The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions  including the Mid Atlantic  the Upland South  and the Southeastern United States  It is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission  the area is commonly defined as  Appalachia    The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills  its historically significant logging and coal mining industries  and its political and labor history  It is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world  making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research  The karst lands contribute to much of the state s cool trout waters  It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities  including skiing  whitewater rafting  fishing  hiking  backpacking  mountain biking  and hunting   1  History  Many ancient man made earthen mounds from various prehistoric mound builder cultures survive  especially in the areas of Moundsville  South Charleston  and Romney  The artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies  They had a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold worked copper pieces   The Iroquois drove out other American Indian tribes from the region to reserve the upper Ohio Valley as a hunting ground in the 1670s  during the Beaver Wars  Siouan language tribes such as the Moneton had also been recorded in the area previously   The area now occupied by West Virginia was contested territory among European Americans as well  with the colonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia claiming territorial rights before the American Revolutionary War  Some speculative land companies  such as the Vandalia Company  and later the Ohio Company and Indiana Company  tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of West Virginia and Kentucky  but failed  With the settlement of the Pennsylvania and Virginia border dispute  which resulted in the creation of Kentucky  Kentuckians  were satisfied        and the inhabitants of a large part of West Virginia were grateful    West Virginia was originally part of the British Virginia Colony from 1607 to 1776 and the western part of the state of Virginia  which was commonly referred as Trans Allegheny Virginia prior to the formation of West Virginia  from 1776 to 1863  Long discontented with electoral malapportionment and underrepresentation in the state legislature  its residents became sharply divided over the issue of secession from the Union during the Civil War  Residents of the western and northern counties set up a separate government under Francis Pierpont in 1861  which they called the  restored  government  Most voted to separate from Virginia and the new state was admitted to the Union in 1863  In 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution  which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote  West Virginia abolished slavery and temporarily disfranchised men who had held Confederate office or fought for the Confederacy   West Virginia s history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain  numerous and vast river valleys  and rich natural resources  These were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of its residents  and remain so today   1 1  Prehistory  A 2010 analysis of a local stalagmite revealed that native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100 BC  Some regional late prehistoric Eastern Woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing  practicing the slash and burn Eastern Agricultural Complex gardening method  Another group progressed to the more time consuming  advanced companion crop fields method of gardening  Also continuing from ancient indigenous people of the state  field space and time was given to tobacco growing through to early historic    Maize  corn  did not make a substantial contribution to the diet until after 1150 B P    to quote Mills  OSU 2003   Eventually  tribal villages began relying heavily on corn to feed their turkey flocks  as Kanawha Fort Ancients practiced bird husbandry  The local Indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called  banick  as they emerged from the protohistoric era  A horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating Fireside Cabin culture  when trading posts along the Potomac and James rivers spread across the state   Robert F  Maslowski wrote   The Adena Indians used pipes for ceremonies  They were carved of stone and they were exceptional works of art  Pipes and the smoking of tobacco became more common during the Late Prehistoric period  They were often made of clay and rather plain    Nothing is known about Paleo Indian and Archaic houses in the Kanawha Valley  but archeologists have found evidence of Woodland and Fort Ancient houses    Woodland Indians lived in wigwams     The Woodland Indians grew sunflowers  gourds  squash and several seeds such as lambsquarter  may grass  sumpweed  smartweed and little barley    Fort Ancient Indians lived in much larger square or rectangular houses     The Fort Ancient Indians can be considered true farmers  They cultivated large agricultural fields around their villages  They no longer grew such a variety of seeds but concentrated on growing corn  beans  sunflowers  gourds  and many types of squash including the pumpkin  They also grew domestic turkeys and kept dogs as pets   As of 2009  over 12 500 archaeological sites have been documented in West Virginia  Bryan Ward 2009 10    1 2  European exploration and settlement  In 1671  General Abraham Wood  at the direction of Royal Governor William Berkeley of the Virginia Colony  sent a party from Fort Henry led by Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam that discovered Kanawha Falls  Some sources state that Governor Alexander Spotswood s 1716 Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition  for which the state s Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th graders was named  had penetrated as far as Pendleton County  however original accounts of the excursion suggest to modern historians that none of his horsemen ventured much farther west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg  Virginia  John Van Metre  an Indian trader  penetrated into the northern portion in 1725  The same year  German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg  the present Shepherdstown  on the Potomac River  and others followed   King Charles II of England  in 1661  granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers  known as the Northern Neck  The grant finally came into the possession of Thomas Fairfax  6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron  and in 1746  a stone was erected at the source of the North Branch Potomac River to mark the western limit of the grant  A considerable part of this land was surveyed by George Washington between 1748 and 1751  The diary kept by the surveyor indicates that there were already many squatters  largely of German origin  along the South Branch Potomac River  Christopher Gist  a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio Company  which was composed chiefly of Virginians  explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752  The company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name  Vandalia   Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750  though they were hindered by Native American resistance  Few Native Americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state  but the region was a common hunting ground  crossed by many trails  During the French and Indian War the scattered British settlements were almost destroyed   In 1774  the Crown Governor of Virginia John Murray  4th Earl of Dunmore  led a force over the mountains  and a body of militia under then Colonel Andrew Lewis dealt the Shawnee Indians  under Hokoleskwa  or  Cornstalk    a crushing blow during the Battle of Point Pleasant at the junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio rivers  At the Treaty of Camp Charlotte concluding Dunmore s War  Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio as the new boundary with the  Long Knives   By 1776  however  the Shawnee had returned to war  joining the Chickamauga  Native American attacks continued until after the American Revolutionary War  During the war  the settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the Continental Army  However  Claypool s Rebellion of 1780–1781  in which a group of men refused to pay Colonial taxes showed war weariness in West Virginia   1 3  Trans Allegheny Virginia  Social conditions in western Virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state  The population was not homogeneous  as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of Pennsylvania and included Germans  Protestant Scotch Irish  and settlers from the states farther north  Counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east Virginians  During the American Revolution  the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of  Westsylvania  was presented to Congress  on the grounds that the mountains made an almost impassable barrier on the east  The rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable  and time only increased the social  political  economic  and cultural differences  see Tuckahoe Cohee  between the two sections of Virginia   A convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for Virginia  against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains  required a property qualification for suffrage and gave the slave holding counties the benefit of three fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state s representation in the U S  House of Representatives  As a result  every county beyond the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution  which nevertheless passed because of eastern support   The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850–51  the Reform Convention  addressed a number of issues important to western Virginians  The vote was extended to all white males of 21 years of age plus  The governor  lieutenant governor  the judiciary  sheriffs  and other county officers were to be elected by public vote  The composition of the General Assembly was changed  representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the white basis of the census of 1850  but the Senate was fixed arbitrarily  the west receiving twenty  and the east thirty  senators  This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation on the white basis in 1865  or else put the matter to a public referendum  But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value  except for slaves  Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300  a fraction of their true value  Small farmers  however  had all their assets  animals  and land taxed at full value  Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west  the vote was 75 748 for and 11 063 against the new Constitution  most of the latter being from eastern counties  which did not like the compromises made for the west   Given these differences  many in the west had long contemplated a separate state  In particular  men like the lawyer Francis H  Pierpont from Fairmont  had long chafed under the political domination of the Tidewater and Piedmont slave holders  In addition to differences over the abolition of slavery  it was felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west  such as turnpikes and railroads   1 4  Separation from Virginia  West Virginia was the only state in the Union to secede from a Confederate state  Virginia  during the American Civil War  In Richmond on April 17  1861  the 49 delegates from the future state of West Virginia voted 17 in favor of the Ordinance of Secession  of Virginia from the United States   30 against  and 2 abstentions  Almost immediately after the vote to proceed with secession from the Union prevailed in the Virginia General Assembly  a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13  1861  When this First Wheeling Convention met  425 delegates from 25 counties were present  though more than one third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area  but soon there was a division of sentiment   Some delegates favored the immediate formation of a new state  while others argued that  as Virginia s secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum  such action would constitute revolution against the United States  It was decided that if the ordinance were adopted  of which there was little doubt   another convention including the members elect of the legislature would meet in Wheeling in June 1861  At the election on May 23  1861  secession was ratified by a large majority in the state as a whole  but in the western counties 34 677 voted against and 19 121 voted for the Ordinance   The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on June 11 and declared that  since the Secession Convention had been called without the consent of the people  all its acts were void and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices  The Wheeling Conventions  and the delegates themselves  were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia  An act for the reorganization of the government was passed on June 19  The next day Francis H  Pierpont was chosen by other delegates at the convention to be governor of Virginia  other officers were elected  and the convention adjourned  The legislature was composed of 103 members  33 of whom had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly on May 23   This number included some hold over Senators from 1859 and as such had vacated their offices to convene in Wheeling  The other members  were chosen even more irregularly—some in mass meetings  others by county committee  and still others were seemingly self appointed  This irregular assembly met on June 20 and appointed Unionists to hold the remainder of the state offices  organized a rival state government  and elected two United States senators who were promptly recognized by the federal government in Washington  D C  Thus  there were two state governments in Virginia  one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy   The Wheeling Convention  which had taken a recess until August 6  reassembled on August 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable  At the October 24  1861 election  18 408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against  The veracity of these election results has been questioned  since the Union army then occupied the area and Union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting  Most of the affirmative votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle  Over 50 000 votes had been cast on the Ordinance of Secession  yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19 000  In Ohio County  home to Wheeling  only about one quarter of the registered voters cast votes  At the Constitutional Convention in November 1861  a Mr  Lamb of Ohio County and a Mr  Carskadon said that in Hampshire County  out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state  the rest were cast illegally by Union soldiers  In most of what would become West Virginia  there was no vote at all as two thirds of the territory of West Virginia had voted for secession and county officers were still loyal to Richmond  Votes recorded from pro secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by Unionist refugees from these counties  The convention began on November 26  1861 and finished its work on February 18  1862  the instrument was ratified  18 162 for and 514 against  on April 11  1862   On May 13 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state  An application for admission to the Union was made to Congress  and on December 31  1862  an enabling act was approved by President Abraham Lincoln admitting West Virginia  on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution  While many felt that West Virginia s admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional  Lincoln issued his Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia finding that  the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislature of Virginia   and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient   The convention was reconvened on February 12  1863  and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met  The revised constitution was adopted on March 26  1863 and on April 20  1863  President Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on June 20  1863  Meanwhile  officers for the new state were chosen  while Gov  Pierpont moved his pro Union Virginia capital to Union occupied Alexandria  where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining Virginia counties within the federal lines   The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in the following manner  Berkeley and Jefferson counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains  in 1863  with the consent of the reorganized government of Virginia voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia  Many voters of the strongly pro secessionist counties were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer upon their return  The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia  asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia which would have declared West Virginia s admission as a state unconstitutional  Meanwhile  on March 10  1866  Congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer  The Supreme Court decided in favor of West Virginia in 1870   During the Civil War  Union General George B  McClellan s forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861  culminating at the Battle of Rich Mountain  and Union control was never again seriously threatened  despite an attempt by Robert E  Lee in the same year  In 1863  General John D  Imboden  with 5 000 Confederates  overran a considerable portion of the state  Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections  and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended  The Eastern Panhandle counties were more affected by the war  with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands   The area which became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies  approximately 22 000–25 000 each  The Wheeling government found it necessary in 1865 to strip voting rights from returning Confederates in order to retain control  James Ferguson  who proposed the law  said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes  The property of Confederates might also be confiscated  and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy was adopted  The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction  The Democratic party secured control in 1870  and in 1871  the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated  The first steps toward this change had been taken  however  by the Republicans in 1870  On August 22  1872  an entirely new constitution was adopted   Beginning in Reconstruction  and for several decades thereafter  the two states disputed the new state s share of the pre war Virginia government s debts  which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements  such as canals  roads  and railroads under the Virginia Board of Public Works  Virginians  led by former Confederate General William Mahone  formed a political coalition which was based upon this  the Readjuster Party  Although West Virginia s first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the Virginia debt  negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were fruitless  and in 1871  Virginia funded two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to West Virginia  The issue was finally settled in 1915  when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12 393 929 50  The final installment of this sum was paid in 1939   1 5  Development of natural resources  After Reconstruction  the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity   Saltpeter caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions  the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the  Saltpeter Trail   a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were rendered and sold to the government  The trail stretched from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the route in the town of Union  Monroe County  Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side  including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave  In the late 18th century  saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave found large animal bones in the deposits  These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to Thomas Jefferson  The bones were named Megalonyx jeffersonii  or great claw  and became known as Jefferson s three toed sloth  It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008  The West Virginia official state rock is bituminous coal  and the official state gemstone is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral   The limestone also produced a useful quarry industry  usually small  and softer  high calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime  This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes  for many years a specific portion of the C & O Railroad carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge  Virginia as an industrial flux   Salt mining had been underway since the 18th century  though it had largely played out by the time of the American Civil War  when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valued commodity of first Confederate  and later Union forces  Later  more sophisticated mining methods would restore West Virginia s role as a major producer of salt   However  in the second half of the 19th century  there was an even greater treasure not yet developed  bituminous coal  It would fuel much of the Industrial Revolution in the U S  and the steamships of many of the world s navies   The residents  both Native Americans and early European settlers  had long known of the underlying coal  and that it could be used for heating and fuel  However  for a long time  very small  personal  mines were the only practical development  After the War  with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding U S  and export markets  As the anthracite mines of northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period  investors and industrialists focused new interest in West Virginia  Geologists such as Dr  David T  Ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects   The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway  C&O  across the state to the new city of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River Coal Field  Soon  the C&O was building its huge coal pier at Newport News  Virginia on the large harbor of Hampton Roads  In 1881  the new Philadelphia based owners of the former Atlantic  Mississippi and Ohio Railroad  AM&O   which stretched across Virginia s southern tier from Norfolk  had sights clearly set on the Mountain State  where the owners had large land holdings  Their railroad was renamed Norfolk and Western  N&W   and a new railroad city was developed at Roanoke to handle planned expansion  After its new president Frederick J  Kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which his wife named  Pocahontas   the N&W redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it  Soon  the N&W was also shipping from new coal piers at Hampton Roads   In 1889  in the southern part of the state  along the Norfolk and Western rail lines  the important coal center of Bluefield  West Virginia was founded  The  capital  of the Pocahontas coalfield  this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades  It shares a sister city with the same name  Bluefield  in Virginia   In the northern portion of the state and elsewhere  the older Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  B&O  and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities  The B&O developed coal piers in Baltimore and at several points on the Great Lakes  Other significant rail carriers of coal were the Western Maryland Railway  WM   Southern Railway  SOU   and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad  L&N    Particularly notable was a latecomer  the Virginian Railway  VGN   By 1900  only a large area of the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity  Within this area west of the New River Coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties lay the Winding Gulf Coalfield  later promoted as the  Billion Dollar Coalfield    A protégé of Dr  Ansted was William Nelson Page  1854–1932   a civil engineer and mining manager in Fayette County  Former West Virginia Governor William A  MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land  as a farmer knows a field   Beginning in 1898  Page teamed with northern and European based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area  They acquired large tracts of land in the area  and Page began the Deepwater Railway  a short line railroad which was chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka  a distance of about    Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad  leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme  In secret collusion  each declined to negotiate favorable rates with Page  nor did they offer to purchase his railroad  as they had many other short lines  However  if the C&O and N&W presidents thought they could thus kill the Page project  they were to be proved mistaken  One of the silent partner investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers  a principal in John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil Trust and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation  A master at competitive  warfare   Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had  deep pockets    Instead of giving up  Page  and Rogers  quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia  using Rogers  private fortune to finance the $40 million cost  When the renamed Virginian Railway  VGN  was completed in 1909  no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads  West Virginia coal was also under high demand at Great Lakes ports  The VGN and the N&W ultimately became parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system  and the VGN s well engineered 21st century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to Hampton Roads   As coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state  there was considerable labor strife as working conditions  safety issues and economic concerns arose  Even in the 21st century  mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states   Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia  as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34 48 carat  6 896 g  Jones Diamond   2  Geography  Located in the Appalachian Mountain range  West Virginia covers an area of   with of land and of water  making it the 41st largest state in the United States  West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast  Virginia in the southeast  Ohio in the northwest  and Kentucky in the southwest  Its longest border is with Virginia at 381 miles  followed by Ohio at 243 miles  Maryland 174 miles  Pennsylvania 118 miles and Kentucky at 79 miles   2 1  Geology and terrain  West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region  and the state is almost entirely mountainous  giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi   Mountaineers are always free    The elevations and ruggedness drop near large rivers like the Ohio River or Shenandoah River  About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions  Though the relief is not high  the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas  The average elevation of West Virginia is approximately above sea level  which is the highest of any US state east of the Mississippi River   On the eastern state line with Virginia  high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those of northern New England and eastern Canada  The highest point in the state is atop Spruce Knob  at   and is covered in a boreal forest of dense spruce trees at altitudes above   Spruce Knob lies within the Monongahela National Forest and is a part of the Spruce Knob Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area  A total of six wilderness areas can also be found within the forest  Outside the forest to the south  the New River Gorge is a canyon deep  carved by the New River  The National Park Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge National River  one of only 15 rivers in the U S  with this level of protection   Other areas under protection and management include   Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion  while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian Blue Ridge forests  The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak  chestnut  maple  beech  and white pine  with willow and American sycamore along the state s waterways  Many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty  a fact that is appreciated by native West Virginians  who refer to their home as Almost Heaven  from the song   Take Me Home  Country Roads  by John Denver   Before the song  it was known as  The Cog State   Coal  Oil  and Gas  or  The Mountain State    The underlying rock strata are sandstone  shale  bituminous coal beds  and limestone laid down in a near shore environment from sediments derived from mountains to the east  in a shallow inland sea on the west  Some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment  some river delta  some shallow water  Sea level rose and fell many times during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian eras  giving a variety of rock strata  The Appalachian Mountains are some of the oldest on earth  having formed over 300 million years ago   2 2  Climate  The climate of West Virginia is a humid subtropical climate  Köppen climate classification Cfa  in some of the lower elevations  primarily in the southwestern portion of the state  including Huntington and Charleston   along with parts of the Eastern Panhandle east of the Appalachians with hot  humid summers and milder winters  The rest of the state generally has a humid continental climate  Köppen climate classification Dfa  except Dfb at the higher elevations  with warm to hot  humid summers and cool to cold winters  increasing in severity with elevation  Some southern highland areas also have a mountain temperate climate  Köppen Cfb  where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are somewhat cooler  However  the weather is subject in all parts of the state to change  The hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the central Appalachian mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations  In the Eastern Panhandle and the Ohio River Valley  temperatures are warm enough to see and grow subtropical plants such as Southern magnolia  Magnolia grandiflora   Crepe Myrtle  Albizia julibrissin  American Sweetgum and even the occasional needle palm and sabal minor  These plants do not thrive as well in other parts of the state  The Eastern prickly pear grows well in many portions of the state   Average January temperatures range from around 26 °F  −4 °C  near the Cheat River to 41 °F  5 °C  along sections of the border with Kentucky  July averages range from 67 °F  19 °C  along the North Branch Potomac River to 76 °F  24 °C  in the western part of the state  It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state  The highest recorded temperature in the state is at Martinsburg on July 10  1936 and the lowest recorded temperature in the state is at Lewisburg on December 30  1917   Annual precipitation ranges from less than in the lower eastern section to more than in higher parts of the Allegheny Front  Slightly more than half the rainfall occurs from April to September  Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section  especially the Tygart Valley  West Virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation  with the cities of Elkins and Beckley ranking 9th and 10th in the U S  respectively for the number of cloudy days per year  over 210   In addition to persistent cloudy skies caused by the damming of moisture by the Alleghenies  West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation  with Snowshoe averaging nearly 200 days a year with either rain or snow  Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections but may persist for weeks in the higher mountain areas  An average of of snow falls annually in Charleston  although during the winter of 1995–1996 more than three times that amount fell as several cities in the state established new records for snowfall  Average snowfall in the Allegheny Highlands can range up to per year  Severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in West Virginia than in most other eastern states  and it ranks among the least tornado prone states east of the Rockies   3  Demographics  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of West Virginia was 1 850 326 on July 1  2014  a  0 14% increase since the 2010 United States

Virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic  It also has the lowest percentage of residents that speak a language other than English in the home  2 7%    The five largest ancestry groups in

The Pew survey results admit to a 6 5% margin of error plus or minus  while the ARIS survey states that  estimates are subject to larger sampling errors in states with small populations   A characteristic of religion in Appalachian communities is the abundance of independent  non affiliated churches  which  remain unnoted and uncounted in any census of church life in the United States
