Yevgeny Ivanovich Zamyatin    January 20  Julian    February 1  Gregorian   1884 – March 10  1937  was a Russian author of science fiction and political satire  He is most famous for his 1921 novel We  a story set in a dystopian future police state  Despite having been a prominent Old Bolshevik  Zamyatin was deeply disturbed by the policies pursued by the CPSU following the October Revolution  In 1921  We became the first work banned by the Soviet censorship board  Ultimately  Zamyatin arranged for We to be smuggled to the West for publication  The subsequent outrage this sparked within the Party and the Union of Soviet Writers led directly to Zamyatin s successful request for exile from his homeland  Due to his use of literature to criticize Soviet society  Zamyatin has been referred to as one of the first Soviet dissidents   1  Early life  Zamyatin was born in Lebedyan  Tambov Governorate  south of Moscow  His father was a Russian Orthodox priest and schoolmaster  and his mother a musician  In a 1922 essay  Zamyatin recalled   You will see a very lonely child  without companions of his own age  on his stomach  over a book  or under the piano  on which his mother is playing Chopin    He may have had synesthesia since he gave letters and sounds qualities  For example  he saw the letter  Л  as having pale  cold  and light blue qualities   He studied naval engineering in Saint Petersburg from 1902 until 1908  during which time he joined the Bolsheviks  He was arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and sent into internal exile in Siberia  However  he escaped and returned to Saint Petersburg where he lived illegally before moving to the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1906 to finish his studies   After returning to Russia  he began to write fiction as a hobby  He was arrested and exiled a second time in 1911  but amnestied in 1913  His Uyezdnoye  A Provincial Tale  in 1913  which satirized life in a small Russian town  brought him a degree of fame  The next year he was tried for maligning the Imperial Russian Military in his story Na Kulichkakh  At the world s end   He continued to contribute articles to various Marxist newspapers   After graduating as an engineer for the Imperial Russian Navy  Zamyatin worked professionally at home and abroad  In 1916 he was sent to the United Kingdom to supervise the construction of icebreakers at the shipyards in Walker and Wallsend while living in Newcastle upon Tyne   2  Literary career  Zamyatin later recalled   In England  I built ships  looked at ruined castles  listened to the thud of bombs dropped by German zeppelins  and wrote The Islanders  I regret that I did not see the February Revolution  and know only the October Revolution  I returned to Petersburg  past German submarines  in a ship with lights out  wearing a life belt the whole time  just in time for October   This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so     Zamyatin s The Islanders  satirizing English life  and the similarly themed A Fisher of Men  were both published after his return to Russia in late 1917  After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he edited several journals  lectured on writing  and edited Russian translations of works by Jack London  O  Henry  H  G  Wells  and others  Zamyatin originally supported the October Revolution  but opposed the increasing use of censorship which followed   His works became increasingly satirical and critical toward the CPSU  Although he supported them before they came to power he slowly came to disagree more and more with their policies particularly those regarding censorship of the arts  In his 1921 essay  I Am Afraid   Zamyatin wrote   True literature can only exist when it is created  not by diligent and reliable officials  but by madmen  hermits  heretics  dreamers  rebels and skeptics   This attitude made his position increasingly difficult as the 1920s wore on  In 1923  Zamyatin arranged for the manuscript of his novel We to be smuggled to E P  Dutton and Company in New York City  After being translated into English by Gregory Zilboorg  the novel was published in 1924   Then  in 1927  Zamyatin went much further  He smuggled the original Russian text to Marc Lvovich Slonim  1894 1976   then editor of a Russian émigré journal and publishing house based in Prague  To the fury of the State  copies of the Slonim edition began being smuggled back to the USSR and secretly passed from hand to hand  Zamyatin s dealing with Western publishers triggered a mass offensive by the Soviet State against him  As a result  he was blacklisted from publishing anything in his homeland   We has often been discussed as a political satire aimed at the police state which Zamyatin perceived in the Soviet Union  There are many other dimensions  however  It may variously be examined as  1  a polemic against the optimistic scientific socialism of H  G  Wells whose works Zamyatin had previously published and with the heroic verses of the  Russian  Proletarian Poets   2  as an example of Expressionist theory and  3  as an illustration of the archetype theories of Carl Jung as applied to literature  George Orwell believed that Aldous Huxley s Brave New World  1932  must be partly derived from We  However  in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins  Huxley says that he wrote Brave New World as a reaction to H G  Wells  utopias long before he had heard of We  Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing Player Piano  1952  he  cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World  whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin s We   In 1994  We received a Prometheus Award in the Libertarian Futurist Society s  Hall of Fame  category   In addition to We  Zamyatin also wrote a number of short stories  in fairy tale form  that constituted satirical criticism of Communist ideology  In one story  the mayor of a city decides that to make everyone happy he must make everyone equal  The mayors then forces everyone  himself included  to live in a big barrack  then to shave their heads to be equal to the bald  and then to become mentally disabled to equate intelligence downward  This plot is very similar to that of The New Utopia  1891  by Jerome K  Jerome whose collected works were published three times in Russia before 1917  In its turn  Kurt Vonnegut s short story  Harrison Bergeron   1961  bears distinct resemblances to Zamyatin s tale   Max Eastman  an American communist who had similarly broken with his former beliefs  described the Politburo s campaign against Zamyatin in his book Artists in Uniform   3  Escape and death  In 1931  Zamyatin appealed directly to Joseph Stalin  requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union  In this letter Zamyatin wrote   I do not wish to conceal that the basic reason for my request for permission to go abroad with my wife is my hopeless position here as a writer  the death sentence that has been pronounced upon me as a writer here at home    With the encouragement of Maxim Gorky  Stalin decided to grant Zamyatin s request   Zamyatin settled with his wife in Paris  where he collaborated with French film director Jean Renoir  Renoir s 1936 adaptation of Gorky s The Lower Depths was co written by Zamyatin   Yevgeny Zamyatin died in poverty of a heart attack in 1937  Only a small group of friends were present for his burial  However  one of the mourners was his Russian language publisher Marc Slonim  who had befriended the Zamyatins  Zamyatin s grave can be found in Cimetière de Thiais  south of Paris   4  Legacy  Through We  Yevgeny Zamyatin directly inspired George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four  Ayn Rand s Anthem  Ursula K  Le Guin s The Dispossessed  Aldous Huxley s Brave New World and Kurt Vonnegut s Player Piano   5  Major writings  Uezdnoe  Уездное   1913 –  A Provincial Tale   tr  Mirra Ginsburg  in The Dragon  Fifteen Stories  1966   Na kulichkakh  На куличках   1914
