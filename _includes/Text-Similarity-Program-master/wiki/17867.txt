London    is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom  It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom  with an urban area of over 9 million inhabitants  Standing on the River Thames  London has been a major settlement for two millennia  its history going back to its founding by the Romans  who named it Londinium  London s ancient core  the City of London  largely retains its mediaeval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7 375  making it the smallest city in England  Since at least the 19th century  the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core  The bulk of this conurbation forms the Greater London administrative area  coterminous with the London region   governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly   London is a leading global city  with strengths in the arts  commerce  education  entertainment  fashion  finance  healthcare  media  professional services  research and development  tourism  and transport all contributing to its preeminence  It is one of the world s leading financial centres and has the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement  London is a world cultural capital  It is the world s most visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world s largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic  London s 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe  In 2012  London became the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times   London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures  and more than 300 languages are spoken within Greater London  The region had an official population of 8 416 535 in 2013  making it the most populous municipality in the European Union  and accounting for 12 5% of the UK population  London s urban area is the second largest in the EU with a population of 9 787 426 according to the 2011 census  London s metropolitan area is the largest in the EU with a total population of 13 614 409  while the Greater London Authority puts the population of London metropolitan region at 21 million  London was the world s most populous city from around 1831 to 1925   London contains four World Heritage Sites  the Tower of London  Kew Gardens  the site comprising the Palace of Westminster  Westminster Abbey  and St Margaret s Church  and the historic settlement of Greenwich  in which the Royal Observatory  Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian  0° longitude  and GMT   Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace  the London Eye  Piccadilly Circus  St Paul s Cathedral  Tower Bridge  Trafalgar Square  and The Shard  London is home to numerous museums  galleries  libraries  sporting events and other cultural institutions  including the British Museum  National Gallery  Tate Modern  British Library and 40 West End theatres  The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world   1  History  1 1  Toponymy  The etymology of London is uncertain  It is an ancient name  found in sources from the 2nd century  It is recorded c  121 as Londinium  which points to Romano British origin  The earliest attempted explanation  now disregarded  is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae  This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud  who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud   From 1898  it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos  this explanation has since been rejected  Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre Celtic Old European * p lowonida  meaning  river too wide to ford   and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London  from this  the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name  *Lowonidonjon  this requires quite a serious amendment however  The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain  which should demand a form * h lōndinion  as opposed to *londīnion   from earlier *loundiniom  The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date  and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name   Until 1889  the name  London  officially only applied to the City of London but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now Greater London   1 2  Prehistory  Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area  In 1999  the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge  This bridge either crossed the Thames  or went to a  lost  island in the river  Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC  In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure  dated to 4500BC  were found on the Thames foreshore  south of Vauxhall Bridge  The function of the mesolithic structure is not known  Both structures are on South Bank  at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames   1 3  Roman London  Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area  the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43 AD  This only lasted until around 61  when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it  burning it to the ground  The next  heavily planned  incarnation of Londinium prospered and superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100  At its height during the 2nd century  Roman London had a population of around 60 000   1 4  Anglo Saxon London  and Viking period   With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century  London ceased to be a capital and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned  although Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin in the Fields area until around 450  From around 500  an Anglo Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area  slightly to the west of the old Roman city  By about 680  it had revived sufficiently to become a major port  although there is little evidence of large scale production of goods  From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking invasions  There are three recorded Viking assaults on London  two of which were successful in 851 and 886 AD  although they were defeated during the attack of 994 AD  The Vikings established Danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of England with its boundary roughly stretching from London to Chester  It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed to by the Danish warlord  Guthrum and west Saxon king  Alfred the Great in 886 AD  Danelaw lasted in many parts of England for centuries to come  The Anglo Saxon Chronicle recorded that London was  refounded  by Alfred the Great in 886  Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls  London then grew slowly until about 950  after which activity increased dramatically   By the 11th century  London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England  Westminster Abbey  rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor  was one of the grandest churches in Europe  Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo Saxon England  but from this time on  London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war  In the view of Frank Stenton   It had the resources  and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self consciousness appropriate to a national capital    1 5  Middle Ages  Following his victory in the Battle of Hastings  William  Duke of Normandy  was crowned King of England in the newly finished Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066  William constructed the Tower of London  the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone  in the southeastern corner of the city  to intimidate the native inhabitants  In 1097  William II began the building of Westminster Hall  close by the abbey of the same name  The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster   During the 12th century  the institutions of central government  which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country  grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place  In most cases this was Westminster  although the royal treasury  having been moved from Winchester  came to rest in the Tower  While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms  its distinct neighbour  the City of London  remained England s largest city and principal commercial centre  and it flourished under its own unique administration  the Corporation of London  In 1100  its population was around 18 000  by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100 000   Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid 14th century  when London lost nearly a third of its population  London was the focus of the Peasants  Revolt in 1381   1 6  Early modern  During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism  with much of London passing from church to private ownership  The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries where it was considered indispensable  But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north west Europe  The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps  any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan  Upon the re opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 there at once ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity  The Royal Exchange was founded  Mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established  with trade expanding to the New World  London became the principal North Sea port  with migrants arriving from England and abroad  The population rose from an estimated 50 000 in 1530 to about 225 000 in 1605   In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre  By the end of the Tudor period in 1603  London was still very compact  There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster  through the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605  London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century  culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666  which killed up to 100 000 people  or a fifth of the population   The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings  Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London  In 1708 Christopher Wren s masterpiece  St Paul s Cathedral was completed  During the Georgian era new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west  and new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London  In the east  the Port of London expanded downstream   In 1762  George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years  During the 18th century  London was dogged by crime and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force  In total  more than 200 offences were punishable by death  including petty theft  Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday  The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas  with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available  and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press   According to Samuel Johnson   1 7  Late modern and contemporary  London was the world s largest city from about 1831 to 1925  London s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics  claiming 14 000 lives in 1848  and 6 000 in 1866  Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world s first local urban rail network  The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties  it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital  London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War the Blitz and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30 000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city  Immediately after the war  the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium  at a time when London had barely recovered from the war   In 1951  the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank  The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956  which ended the  pea soup fogs  for which London had been notorious  From the 1940s onwards  London became home to a large number of immigrants  largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica  India  Bangladesh and Pakistan  making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe   Primarily starting in the mid 1960s  London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture  exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King s Road  Chelsea and Carnaby Street  The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era  In 1965 London s political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created  During The Troubles in Northern Ireland  London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA  Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot  Greater London s population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War  from an estimated peak of 8 6 million in 1939 to around 6 8 million in the 1980s  The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury  with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration as the Canary Wharf development  This was borne out of London s ever increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s   The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea  The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986  which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration  In 2000  London wide government was restored  with the creation of the Greater London Authority  To celebrate the start of the 21st century  the Millennium Dome  London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed  On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics  making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times   2  Government  2 1  Local government  The administration of London is formed of two tiers—a city wide  strategic tier and a local tier  City wide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority  GLA   while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities  The GLA consists of two elected components  the Mayor of London  who has executive powers  and the London Assembly  who scrutinise the mayor s decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year  The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall  Southwark  the mayor is Boris Johnson  The mayor s statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan  which was most recently revised in 2011  The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation  They are responsible for most local services  such as local planning  schools  social services  local roads and refuse collection  Certain functions  such as waste management  are provided through joint arrangements  In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion  £14 7 billion for the boroughs and £7 4 billion for the GLA    Policing in Greater London  with the exception of the City of London  is provided by the Metropolitan Police Force  overseen by the Mayor through the Mayor s Office for Policing and Crime  MOPAC   The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police  The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail and London Underground services   The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London  It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world  National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service  LAS  NHS Trust  the largest free at the point of use emergency ambulance service in the world  The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required  Her Majesty s Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames  which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea   2 2  National government  London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom  Many government departments are based close to the Palace of Westminster  particularly along Whitehall  including the Prime Minister s residence at 10 Downing Street  The British Parliament is often referred to as the  Mother of Parliaments   although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright  because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems  and its Acts have created many other parliaments  There are 73 Members of Parliament  MPs  from London  who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament  Of these  38 are from the Labour Party  28 are Conservatives  and 7 are Liberal Democrats   3  Geography  3 1  Scope  Greater London is the top level administrative subdivision covering London  The small  ancient City of London at its core once contained the whole settlement  but as the urban area grew the City Corporation resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs  causing  London  to be defined in a number ways for different purposes  Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town  within which  LONDON  forms part of postal addresses   The London telephone area code  020  covers a larger area  similar in size to Greater London  although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included  The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places   Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt  although the built up area extends beyond the boundary in places  resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area  Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt  Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London  The city is split by the River Thames into North and South  with an informal central London area in its interior  The coordinates of the nominal centre of London  traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall  are approximately    3 2  Status  Within London  both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are the ceremonial counties  The area of Greater London has incorporated areas that were once part of the historic counties of Middlesex  Kent  Surrey  Essex and Hertfordshire  London s status as the capital of England  and later the United Kingdom  has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written form   Its position was formed through constitutional convention  making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK s unwritten constitution  The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court  and thus the political capital of the nation  More recently  Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London   3 3  Topography  Greater London encompasses a total area of   an area which had a population of 7 172 036 in 2001 and a population density of   The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration  comprises a total area of has a population of 13 709 000 and a population density of   Modern London stands on the Thames  its primary geographical feature  a navigable river which crosses the city from the south west to the east  The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill  Addington Hills  and Primrose Hill  The Thames was once a much broader  shallower river with extensive marshlands  at high tide  its shores reached five times their present width   Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked  and many of its London tributaries now flow underground  The Thames is a tidal river  and London is vulnerable to flooding  The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow  tilting  of Britain  up in the north and down in the south  caused by post glacial rebound   In 1974  a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat  While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070  concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed   3 4  Climate  London has a temperate oceanic climate  Köppen  Cfb      similar to all of southern Britain  Despite its reputation as being a rainy city  London receives less precipitation  with in a year   than Rome  at    Bordeaux  at    Toulouse  at    and Naples  at per year   Temperature extremes for all sites in the London area range from at Kew during August 2003 down to at Northolt during January 1962  has been achieved in nearby Gravesend  however  which tends to record the highest temperature readings in the UK during summer  Temperatures of below have been noted prior to the 20th century  but the accuracy cannot be validated   Summers are generally warm and sometimes hot  London s average July high is   On average London will see 31 days above each year  and 4 2 days above every year  During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached   leading to hundreds of heat related deaths  Winters are generally cool and damp with little temperature variation  Snowfall does occur from time to time  and can cause travel disruption when this happens  Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant  On 1 October 2011  the air temperature attained and in April 2011 it reached   As a large city  London has a considerable urban heat island effect  making the centre of London at times warmer than the suburbs and outskirts  The effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow on the outskirts of London with the London Weather Centre which is located in the centre of London   3 5  Districts  London s vast urban area is often described using a set of district names  such as Bloomsbury  Mayfair  Wembley and Whitechapel  These are either informal designations  reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl  or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs   Such names have remained in use through tradition  each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character  but without official boundaries  Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London  The City of London is the main financial district  and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east   The West End is London s main entertainment and shopping district  attracting tourists  West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds  The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London   The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London  known for its high immigrant population  as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London  The surrounding East London area saw much of London s early industrial development  now  brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley  which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics   3 6  Architecture  London s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style  partly because of their varying ages  Many grand houses and public buildings  such as the National Gallery  are constructed from Portland stone  Some areas of the city  particularly those just west of the centre  are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings  Few structures in central London pre date the Great Fire of 1666  these being a few trace Roman remains  the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City  Further out is  for example  the Tudor period Hampton Court Palace  England s oldest surviving Tudor palace  built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c  1515  Wren s late 17th century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England  to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied architectural heritage  The disused  but soon to be rejuvenated  1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south west is a local landmark  while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture  most notably St  Pancras and Paddington  The density of London varies  with high employment density in the central area  high residential densities in inner London and lower densities in Outer London   The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London  which originated nearby  Marble Arch and Wellington Arch  at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively  have royal connections  as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington  Nelson s Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square  one of the focal points of the city centre  Older buildings are mainly brick built  most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange red variety  often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings   In the dense areas  most of the concentration is via medium  and high rise buildings  London s skyscrapers such as 30 St Mary Axe  Tower 42  the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are mostly in the two financial districts  the City of London and Canary Wharf  High rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul s Cathedral and other historic buildings  Nevertheless there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central London  see Tall buildings in London   including the 72 storey Shard London Bridge  the tallest building in the European Union   Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape  and the British Library in Somers Town Kings Cross  What was formerly the Millennium Dome  by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf  is now an entertainment venue called The O2 Arena   3 7  Natural history  The London Natural History Society suggest that London is  one of the World s Greenest Cities  with more than 40% green space or open water  They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish  They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly  1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London  London s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds  London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest  SSSIs   two National Nature Reserves and 76 Local Nature Reserves   Amphibians are common in the capital  including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern  and common frogs  common toads  palmate newts and great crested newts  however  native reptiles such as slow worms  common lizards  grass snakes and adders  are mostly only seen in outer London  Among other inhabitants of London are 10 000 foxes  so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile  2 6 square kilometres  of London  These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins  sharing the pavement  sidewalk  with pedestrians and raising cubs in people s backyards  Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament  where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet  Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace  reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II s prized pink flamingos  Generally  however  foxes and city folk appear to get along  A survey in 2001 by the London based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of Londoners liked having them around   Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehogs  rats  mice  rabbit  shrew  vole  and squirrels  In wilder areas of Outer London  such as Epping Forest  a wide variety of mammals are found including hare  badger  field  bank and water vole  wood mouse  yellow necked mouse  mole  shrew  and weasel  in addition to fox  squirrel and hedgehog  A dead otter was found at The Highway  in Wapping  about a mile from the Tower Bridge  which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absence a hundred years from the city  Ten of England s eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest  soprano  nathusius and common pipistrelles  noctule  serotine  barbastelle  daubenton’s  brown Long eared  natterer’s and leisler’s   Among the strange sights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames  while The BBC Two programme  Natural World  Unnatural History of London   shows pigeons using the London Underground to get around the city  a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market  and foxes that will  sit  if given sausages   Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park  A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained  Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer  which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest  A rare population of melanistic  black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois  Muntjac deer  which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century  are also found in the forest  While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city  more recently urban deer have becoming a regular feature  and whole herds of fallow and white tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of the London s green spaces  There are in London also many muntjak deer  but because they are shy it is less common to see them   4  Demography  With increasing industrialisation  London s population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries  and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York City in 1925  Its population peaked at 8 615 245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War  but had declined to 7 192 091 at the 2001 Census  However  the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses  to reach 8 173 941 in the latter enumeration   However  London s continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9 787 426 people in 2011  while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used  According to Eurostat  London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe  or third if Istanbul is included   During the period 1991–2001 a net 726 000 immigrants arrived in London   The region covers an area of   The population density is   more than ten times that of any other British region  In terms of population  London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region in the world  As of 2014  London has the largest number of billionaires  British Pound Sterling  in the world  with 72 residing in the city  London ranks as one of the most expensive cities in the world  alongside Tokyo and Moscow   4 1  Ethnic groups  According to the Office for National Statistics  based on the 2011 Census estimates  59 8 per cent of the 8 173 941 inhabitants of London were White  with 44 9 per cent White British  2 2 per cent White Irish  0 1 per cent gypsy Irish traveller and 12 1 per cent classified as Other White   20 9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed Asian descent  19 7 per cent are of full Asian descent  with those of mixed Asian heritage comprising 1 2 of the population  Indians account for 6 6 per cent of the population  followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2 7 per cent each  Chinese peoples account for 1 5 per cent of the population  with Arabs comprising 1 3 per cent  A further 4 9 per cent are classified as  Other Asian    15 6 per cent of London s population are of Black and mixed Black descent  13 3 per cent are of full Black descent  with those of mixed Black heritage comprising 2 3 per cent  Black Africans account for 7 0 per cent of London s population  with 4 2 per cent as Black Caribbean and 2 1 per cent as  Other Black   5 0 per cent are of mixed race   Across London  Black and Asian children outnumber White British children by about six to four in state schools  However  White children represented 62 per cent of London s 1 498 700 population aged 0 to 15  according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics from 2009  with 55 7 per cent of the population aged 0 to 15 being White British  0 7 per cent White Irish and 5 6 per cent from other EU White backgrounds  In January 2005  a survey of London s ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non indigenous communities with a population of more than 10 000  Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that    London s foreign born population was 2 650 000  33 per cent   up from 1 630 000 in 1997   The 2011 census showed that 36 7 per cent of Greater London s population were born outside the UK  The table to the right shows the 20 most common foreign countries of birth of London residents in 2011  the date of the last published UK Census  A portion of the German born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany  Estimates produced by the
