In abstract algebra  a normal subgroup is a subgroup which is invariant under conjugation by members of the group of which it is a part  In other words  a subgroup H of a group G is normal in G if and only if gH   Hg for all g in G  i e   the sets of left and right cosets coincide  Normal subgroups  and only normal subgroups  can be used to construct quotient groups from a given group   Évariste Galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups   1  Definitions  A subgroup N of a group G is called a normal subgroup if it is invariant under conjugation  that is  for each element n in N and each g in G  the element gng蜢1 is still in N  We write  For any subgroup  the following conditions are equivalent to normality  Therefore any one of them may be taken as the definition   For all g in G  gNg蜢1 ⊆ N   For all g in G  gNg蜢1   N   The sets of left and right cosets of N in G coincide   For all g in G  gN   Ng   N is a union of conjugacy classes of G   There is some homomorphism on G for which N is the kernel  The last condition accounts for some of the importance of normal subgroups  they are a way to internally classify all homomorphisms defined on a group  For example  a non identity finite group is simple if and only if it is isomorphic to all of its non identity homomorphic images  a finite group is perfect if and only if it has no normal subgroups of prime index  and a group is imperfect if and only if the derived subgroup is not supplemented by any proper normal subgroup   2  Examples  The subgroup  e  consisting of just the identity element of G and G itself are always normal subgroups of G  The former is called the trivial subgroup  and if these are the only normal subgroups  then G is said to be simple   The center of a group is a normal subgroup   The commutator subgroup is a normal subgroup   More generally  any characteristic subgroup is normal  since conjugation is always an automorphism   All subgroups N of an abelian group G are normal  because gN   Ng  A group that is not abelian but for which every subgroup is normal is called a Hamiltonian group   The translation group in any dimension is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group  for example in 3D rotating  translating  and rotating back results in only translation  also reflecting  translating  and reflecting again results in only translation  a translation seen in a mirror looks like a translation  with a reflected translation vector   The translations by a given distance in any direction form a conjugacy class  the translation group is the union of those for all distances   In the Rubik s Cube group  the subgroup consisting of operations which only affect the corner pieces is normal  because no conjugate transformation can make such an operation affect an edge piece instead of a corner  By contrast  the subgroup consisting of turns of the top face only is not normal  because a conjugate transformation can move parts of the top face to the bottom and hence not all conjugates of elements of this subgroup are contained in the subgroup   3  Properties  Normality is preserved upon surjective homomorphisms  and is also preserved upon taking inverse images   Normality is preserved on taking direct products  A normal subgroup of a normal subgroup of a group need not be normal in the group  That is  normality is not a transitive relation  However  a characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal  Also  a normal subgroup of a central factor is normal  In particular  a normal subgroup of a direct factor is normal   Every subgroup of index 2 is normal  More generally  a subgroup H of finite index n in G contains a subgroup K normal in G and of index dividing n  called the normal core  In particular  if p is the smallest prime dividing the order of G  then every subgroup of index p is normal   3 1  Lattice of normal subgroups  The normal subgroups of a group G form a lattice under subset inclusion with least element  e  and greatest element G  Given two normal subgroups N and M in G  meet is defined as  and join is defined as  The lattice is complete and modular   4  Normal subgroups and homomorphisms  If N is normal subgroup  we can define a multiplication on cosets by  This turns the set of cosets into a group called the quotient group G N  There is a natural homomorphism f  G → G N given by f a    aN  The image f N  consists only of the identity element of G N  the coset eN   N   In general  a group homomorphism f  G → H sends subgroups of G to subgroups of H  Also  the preimage of any subgroup of H is a subgroup of G  We call the preimage of the trivial group  e  in H the kernel of the homomorphism and denote it by ker f   As it turns out  the kernel is always normal and the image f G  of G is always isomorphic to G ker f   the first isomorphism theorem   In fact  this correspondence is a bijection between the set of all quotient groups G N of G and the set of all homomorphic images of G  up to isomorphism   It is also easy to see that the kernel of the quotient map  f  G → G N  is N itself  so we have shown that the normal subgroups are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms with domain G   5  See also  5 1  Operations taking subgroups to subgroups  normalizer  conjugate closure  normal core  5 2  Subgroup properties complementary  or opposite  to normality  malnormal subgroup
