Thomas Riley Marshall  March 14  1854 – June 1  1925  was an American Democratic politician who served as the 28th Vice President of the United States  1913–1921  under Woodrow Wilson  A prominent lawyer in Indiana  he became an active and well known member of the Indiana Democratic Party by stumping across the state for other candidates and organizing party rallies that later helped him win election as the 27th Governor of Indiana  In office  he proposed a controversial and progressive state constitution and pressed for other progressive era reforms  The Republican minority used the state courts to block the attempt to change the constitution   His popularity as governor  and Indiana s status as a critical swing state  helped him secure the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket with Wilson in 1912 and win the subsequent general election  An ideological rift developed between the two men during their first term  leading Wilson to limit Marshall s influence in the administration  and his brand of humor caused Wilson to move Marshall s office away from the White House  During Marshall s second term he delivered morale boosting speeches across the nation during World War I and became the first vice president to hold cabinet meetings  which he did while Wilson was in Europe  While he was president in the United States Senate  a small number of anti war senators kept it deadlocked by refusing to end debate  To enable critical wartime legislation to be passed  Marshall had the body adopt its first procedural rule allowing filibusters to be ended by a two thirds majority vote—a variation of this rule remains in effect   Marshall s vice presidency is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919  Because of their personal dislike for him  Wilson s advisers and wife sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president s condition to prevent him from easily assuming the presidency  Many people  including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders  urged Marshall to become acting president  but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent  Without strong leadership in the executive branch  the administration s opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy   Well known for his wit and sense of humor  one of Marshall s most enduring jokes came during a Senate debate in which  in response to Senator Joseph Bristow s catalog of the nation s needs  Marshall quipped the often repeated phrase   What this country needs is a really good five cent cigar   provoking laughter  After his terms as vice president  he opened an Indianapolis law practice  where he authored several legal books and his memoir  Recollections  He continued to travel and speak publicly  Marshall died while on a trip after suffering a heart attack in 1925   1  Early life  1 1  Family and background  Thomas Marshall s paternal grandfather  Riley Marshall  immigrated to Indiana in 1817 and settled on a farm in what is now Whitley County  He became wealthy when a moderate deposit of oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm  when he sold the farm in 1827 it earned $25 000  $ in 2009 chained dollars  The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and spend the rest of his life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party  serving as an Indiana State Senator  party chairman  and financial contributor  He was also able to send his only child  Daniel  to medical school   Marshall s mother  Martha Patterson  was orphaned at age 13 while living in Ohio and came to live with her sister on a farm near the Marshalls  Indiana home  She was known for her wit and humor  as her son later would be  Martha and Daniel met and married in 1848   Thomas Marshall was born in North Manchester  Indiana on March 14  1854  Two years later  a sister was born  but she died in infancy  Martha had contracted tuberculosis  which Daniel believed to be the cause of their infant daughter s poor health  While Marshall was still a young boy  his family moved several times in search of a good climate for Daniel to attempt different  outdoor cures  on Martha  They moved first to Quincy  Illinois in 1857  Daniel Marshall was a supporter of the American Union and a staunch Democrat  and took his son to the Lincoln and Douglas debate in Freeport in 1858  There the four year old Marshall met Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln and sat on the lap of whichever candidate was not speaking  He later referred to this as one of his earliest and most cherished memories   The family moved to Osawatomie  Kansas in 1859 but the violence on the frontier led them to move to Missouri in 1860  eventually Daniel succeeded in curing Martha s disease  As the American Civil War neared  violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents  In October several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro slavery faction  He refused  and they left  After their departure  the Marshalls  neighbors warned them that Green was planning to return and murder them  They helped the Marshalls quickly pack their belongings and escape to Illinois by steamboat  The Marshalls remained there only a brief time before continuing to Indiana  even farther from the volatile border region   1 2  Education  On settling in Princeton  Indiana  Marshall began to attend public school  His father and grandfather became embroiled in a dispute with their Methodist minister when they refused to vote Republican in the 1862 election  The minister threatened to expel them from the church  to which Marshall s grandfather replied that he would  take his risk on hell  but not the Republican Party   The dispute prompted the family to move again  to Fort Wayne  and convert to the Presbyterian church  In Fort Wayne  Marshall attended high school  graduating in 1869  At age fifteen his parents sent him to Wabash College  in Crawfordsville  where he received a classical education  His father advised him to study medicine or become a minister  but neither interested him  he entered the school without knowing which profession he would take upon graduation   Marshall joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity  participated in literary and debating societies  and founded a Democratic Club  He secured a position on the staff of the college newspaper  the Geyser  and began writing political columns defending Democratic policies  In 1872 he wrote an unfavorable column about a female lecturer at the school  accusing her of  seeking liberties  with the young boys in their boarding house  She hired lawyer Lew Wallace  the author of Ben Hur  and filed a suit demanding that Marshall pay her $20 000 for libel  Marshall traveled to Indianapolis in search of a defense lawyer and employed future United States President Benjamin Harrison  then a prominent lawyer in the area  Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were probably true  In Marshall s memoir  he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill  his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service  but instead gave him a lecture on ethics   Marshall was elected to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college  He graduated in June 1873  receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty six courses in a class of twenty one students  As a result of his libel case  he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him  At that time  the only way to become a lawyer in Indiana was to apprentice under a member of the Indiana bar association  His great uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him  but soon moved away  Marshall went to live with his parents  who had moved to Columbia City  There he read law in the office of Walter Olds  a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court  He studied in the office for over a year and was admitted to the Indiana bar on April 26  1875   1 3  Law practice  Marshall opened a law practice in Columbia City in 1876  taking on many minor cases  After gaining prominence  he accepted William F  McNagny as a partner in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases  The two men functioned well as partners  McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments  Marshall  the superior orator  argued the cases before the judge and jury  Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high profile cases  In 1880 Marshall ran for public office for the first time as the Democratic candidate for his district s prosecuting attorney  The district was a Republican stronghold  and he was defeated  About the same time  he met and began to court Kate Hooper  and the two became engaged to marry  Kate died of an illness in 1882  one day before they were to be wed  Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall  leading him to become an alcoholic   Marshall lived with his parents into his thirties  His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894  leaving him with the family estate and business  In 1895  while working on a case  Marshall met Lois Kimsey who was working as a clerk in her father s law firm  Despite their eighteen year age difference  the couple fell in love and married on October 2  The Marshalls had a close marriage and were nearly inseparable  and spent only two nights apart during their thirty year marriage   Marshall s alcoholism had begun to interfere with his busy life prior to his marriage  He arrived at court hung over on several occasions and was unable to keep his addiction secret in his small hometown  His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen  Thereafter  he became active in temperance organizations and delivered several speeches about the dangers of liquor  Although he had stopped drinking  his past alcoholism was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign   Marshall remained active in the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state  His speeches were noted for their partisanship  but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s as he began to identify himself with the growing progressive movement  He became a member of the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904  a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party   Marshall and his wife were involved in several private organizations  He was active in the Presbyterian Church  taught Sunday school  and served on the county fair board  As he grew wealthy from his law firm he became involved in local charities  An active Mason and member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana  by 1898 he was a Master Mason and had risen to the thirty third degree in the Scottish Rite  the highest level of the order  and had become a member of its Supreme Council  He remained an active mason until his death and served on several masonic charitable boards   2  Governorship  2 1  Campaign  In 1906  Marshall declined his party s nomination to run for Congress  He did hint to state party leaders that he would be interested in running for governor in the 1908 election  He soon gained the support of several key labor unions  and was endorsed by a reporter in the Indianapolis Star  Despite this support  at the state convention he was a dark horse candidate  Party boss Thomas Taggart did not support him because of Marshall s support of prohibition  Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti prohibitionist Samuel Ralston  but the prohibitionist and anti Taggart factions united with Marshall s supporters  giving him the votes needed to win   Marshall s opponent in the general election was Republican Congressman James E  Watson  and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition  Just as it began  the Republican controlled state government passed a local option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor  The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates  The Democrats proposed that the local option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level  This drew support from anti prohibitionists  who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas  and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated  The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists  support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it  The Republican Party was in the midst of a period of instability  splitting along progressive and conservative lines  Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election  giving Marshall a narrow victory  he received 48 1% of the vote to Watson s 48%  He was the first Democratic governor in two decades  Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin  though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate   2 2  Progressive agenda  Marshall was inaugurated as Governor of Indiana on January 11  1909  Since his party had been out of power for many years  its initial objective was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions  Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system  He allowed the party s different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices  He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates  but signed off himself on the official appointments  Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party  it prevented him from building a strong political base   During his term  Marshall focused primarily on advancing the progressive agenda  He successfully advocated the passage of a child labor law and anti corruption legislation  He supported popular election of United States Senators  and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term  He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars  He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government s regulatory powers   Marshall was a strong opponent of Indiana s recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws  and ordered state institutions not to follow them  He was an early  high profile opponent of eugenics laws  and he carried his opposition into the vice presidency  His governorship was the first in which no state executions took place  due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution  He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses  He participated in a number of ceremonial events  including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909   2 3  Marshall s constitution  Rewriting the state constitution became Marshall s central focus as governor  and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he began to seek alternative means by which to have a new constitution adopted  He and Jacob Piatt Dunn  a close friend and civic leader  wrote a new constitution that increased the state s regulatory powers considerably  set minimum wages  and gave constitutional protections to unions  Many of these reforms were also in the Socialist Party platform under its leader  Terre Haute native Eugene V  Debs  Republicans believed Marshall s constitution was an attempt to win over Debs  supporters  who had a strong presence in Indiana  The constitution also allowed direct democracy initiatives and referendums to be held  The Democratic controlled assembly agreed to the request and put the measure on the ballot  His opponents attacked the direct democracy provisions  claiming they were a violation of the United States Constitution  which required states to operate republican forms of government  The 1910 mid term elections gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate  increasing the constitution s chances of being adopted  Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election   Republicans opposed the ratification process  and were infuriated that the Democrats were attempting to revise the entire constitution without calling a constitutional convention  as had been called for the state s two previous constitutions  Marshall argued that no convention was needed because the existing constitution did not call for one  Republicans took the issue to court and the Marion County Circuit Court granted an injunction removing the constitution from the 1912 ballot  Marshall appealed  but the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the decision in a judgment which stated that the Constitution of Indiana could not be replaced in total without a constitutional convention  based on the precedent set by Indiana s first two constitutions  Marshall was angry with the decision and delivered a speech attacking the court and accusing it of overstepping its authority  He launched a final appeal to the United States Supreme Court but left office in January 1913 while the case was still pending  Later that year  the court declined the appeal  finding that the issue was within the sole jurisdiction of the state courts  Marshall was disappointed with the outcome  Subsequent historians  like Professor Linda Gugin  have called the process and the document itself  hopelessly flawed   and legal expert James St  Claire has written that if the constitution had been adopted  large parts would probably have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts   3  Vice presidency  3 1  Election  The Indiana constitution prevented Marshall from serving a consecutive term as governor  He made plans to run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended  but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor  Although he did not attend the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore  his name was put forward as Indiana s choice for president  He was suggested as a compromise nominee  but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark  securing the nomination for Wilson  Indiana s delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson  Indiana was an important swing state  and Wilson hoped that Marshall s popularity would help him carry it in the general election  He had his delegates support Marshall  giving him the vice presidential nomination  Marshall privately turned down the nomination  assuming the job would be boring given its limited role  He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities  During the campaign  Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches  The Wilson–Marshall ticket easily won the 1912 election because of the division between the Republican Party and the Progressive Party   Marshall was not fond of Wilson  as he disagreed with him on a number of issues  Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings  Marshall s ideas were rarely considered for implementation  and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly  In 1913 Wilson took the then unheard of step of meeting personally with members of the Senate to discuss policy  Before this  presidents used the vice president  who serves as president of the senate  as a go between  Wilson used the opportunity to show that he did not trust Marshall with delicate business  In his memoir  Marshall s only negative comment towards Wilson was   I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization  they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world   Their relationship was described as one of  functioning animosity    3 2  Senate developments  Marshall was not offended by Wilson s lack of interest in his ideas  and considered his primary constitutional duty to be in the Senate  He viewed the vice presidential office as being in the legislative branch  not the executive  While he presided in the Senate  emotions sometimes ran high  including during a debate on the Mexican border crisis in 1916  During that debate Marshall threatened to expel certain senators from the chamber for their raucous behavior  but did not carry through on the threat  On several occasions  he ordered the Senate gallery cleared  He voted eight times to break tie votes   In the debates leading up to World War I  a number of isolationist senators filibustered bills that Wilson considered important  The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months  Wilson and the bills  supporters requested that Marshall put a gag order in place to cut off debate  but he refused on ethical grounds  allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster  Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves  and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies  Despite their victories  the small group of senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro war legislation from passing  In response  Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8  1917  allowing filibusters to be broken by two thirds of voting Senators  This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired  The rule has been modified several times  most prominently that the current rule requires three fifths of all Senators  not only the ones voting   As Marshall made little news and was viewed as a somewhat comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor  a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the 1916 reelection ticket  Wilson  after deliberating  decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity  thus in 1916 Marshall won reelection over the still divided Republican Party and became the first vice president re elected since John C  Calhoun in 1828  and Wilson and Marshall became the first president and vice president team to be re elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820   3 3  Assassination attempt  On the evening of July 2  1915  Eric Muenter  an anarchist and onetime German professor at Harvard and Cornell universities  who opposed American support of the allied war effort  broke into the Senate chamber  laid dynamite around Marshall s office door  and set it with a timer  The bomb exploded prematurely  just before midnight while no one was in the office  On July 5  Muenter burst into the Glen Cove  New York home of Jack Morgan  the son of J P  Morgan  demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the allies  Morgan told the man he was in no position to comply with his demand  Muenter struck him in the head and escaped  Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president  Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident  but declined it   3 4  World War I  During Marshall s second term  the United States entered World War I  Marshall was a reluctant supporter of the war  believing the country to be unprepared and feared it would be necessary to enact conscription  He was pleased with Wilson s strategy to begin a military buildup before the declaration of war  and fully supported the war effort once it had begun  Shortly after the first troops began to assemble for transport to Europe  Marshall and Wilson hosted a delegation from the United Kingdom in which Marshall became privy to the primary war strategy  However  he was largely excluded from war planning and rarely received official updates on the progress of military campaigns  In most instances he received news of the war through the newspapers   Wilson sent Marshall around the nation to deliver morale boosting speeches and encourage Americans to buy Liberty Bonds in support of the war effort  Marshall was well suited for the job  as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president  and gladly accepted the responsibility  In his speeches  he cast the war as a  moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals   In his memoir  he recalled that the war seemed to drag on  with leaden feet   and that he was relieved when it finally ended  As the war neared its end  Marshall became the first vice president to conduct cabinet meetings  Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the Versailles treaty and to work on gathering support for his League of Nations idea  Wilson became the first president to personally deliver a treaty to be ratified by the Senate  which he presented to Marshall as the presiding officer during a morning session   3 5  Morrison  Marshall s wife was heavily involved in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children  In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins  one of whom was chronically ill  The child s parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son s condition  Lois Marshall formed a close bond with the baby  who was named Clarence Ignatius Morrison  and offered to take him and help him find treatment  She and Marshall had been unable to have children  and when she brought the baby home  Marshall told her that she could  keep him  provided he did not squall       Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he  never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart   and  as the boy grew older  that he was  beautiful as an angel  brilliant beyond his years  lovable from every standpoint    The Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison because they believed that to go through the procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public  Wanting to keep the situation private  they instead made a special arrangement with his parents  President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said   With congratulations to the baby  Wilson   Morrison lived with the Marshalls for the rest of his life  In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall  but in person they called him Izzy  Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health  but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920  just before his fourth birthday  His death devastated Marshall  who wrote in his memoir that Izzy  was and is and ever will be so sacred to me        3 6  Succession crisis  President Wilson experienced a mild stroke in September 1919  On October 2  he was struck by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated  Wilson s closest adviser  Joseph Tumulty  did not believe Marshall would be a suitable president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming the presidency  Wilson s wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his  uncouthed  disposition  and also opposed his assumption of the presidency  Tumulty and Edith believed that an official communication from Wilson s staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president  and made sure no such communication occurred  After Marshall demanded to know Wilson s status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president  they had a reporter from the Baltimore Sun brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death  Marshall later said that  it was the first great shock of my life   but without an official communication on Wilson s condition  he didn t believe he could constitutionally assume the presidency   On October 5  Secretary of State Robert Lansing was the first official to propose that Marshall forcibly assume the presidency  Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing s request  as did Congressional leaders  including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall  Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support  After consulting with his wife and his long time personal adviser  Mark Thistlethwaite  he privately refused to assume Wilson s duties and become Acting President of the United States  The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time  and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from office  Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president  but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson s dislike for Marshall  Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume the presidency were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so  or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties   Wilson was kept secluded by his wife and personal physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him  none would divulge official information on his condition  Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition  he was unable to do so  and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson s physician  Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president  a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall s requested joint resolution  The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty  however  believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification  Wilson  in his present condition  was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions  and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock  In order to prevent the treaty s ratification  the anti League senators blocked the joint resolution   On December 4  Lansing announced in a Senate committee hearing that no one in the cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days  The senators seeking to elevate Marshall requested that a committee be sent to check on Wilson s condition  hoping to gain evidence to support their cause  Dubbed the  smelling committee  by several newspapers  the group discovered Wilson was in very poor health  but seemed to have recovered enough of his faculties to make decisions  Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution   At a Sunday church service in mid December  in what Marshall believed was an attempt by other officials to force him to assume the presidency  a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died  Marshall was shocked  and rose to announce the news to the congregation  The ministers held a prayer  the congregation began singing hymns  and many people wept  Marshall and his wife exited the building  and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action  only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax  and that Wilson was still living   Marshall performed a few ceremonial functions for the remainder of Wilson s term  such as hosting foreign dignitaries  Among these was Albert I  King of the Belgians  the first European monarch to visit the United States  Edward  Prince of Wales  the future monarch of the United Kingdom  spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him  First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson s communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others  The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration s opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty  They attacked the treaty s tenth article  which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress  Marshall personally supported the treaty s adoption  but recommended several changes  including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States  sphere of influence  and that the tenth article be made non binding   Wilson began to recover by the end of 1919  but remained secluded for the remainder of his term  steadfast in his refusal or inability to accept changes to the treaty  Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his true condition until his final day in office  It remains unclear who was making the executive branch s decisions during Wilson s incapacity  but it was likely the first lady with the help of the presidential advisers   4  Later life  Marshall had his name entered as a candidate for the 1920 presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention  He made arrangements with Thomas Taggart to have a delegation sent from Indiana to support his bid  but was unable to garner support outside of the Hoosier delegation  Ultimately he endorsed the Democratic nominees  James M  Cox as president and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as vice president  but they were defeated by the Republican ticket of Warren G  Harding and Calvin Coolidge  On their election  Marshall sent a note to Coolidge in which he offered him his  sincere condolences  for his misfortune in being elected vice president   Marshall considered returning to Columbia City after leaving office  but instead bought a home and opened a law practice in Indianapolis  where he believed there would be better business opportunities  Harding nominated him to serve on the Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921  and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922  Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923  He spent over a year writing books on the law and his Recollections  a humorous memoir  The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual  even for its time  for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall s enemies  Marshall remained a popular public speaker  and continued to travel to give speeches  The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth   While on a trip to Washington D C   Marshall was struck by a heart attack while reading his Bible in bed on the night of June 1  1925  His wife called for medical assistance  but he died before it arrived  A service and viewing was held in Washington two days later and was attended by many dignitaries  Marshall s remains were returned to Indianapolis  where he lay in state for two days  thousands visited his bier  His funeral service was held June 9  and he was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery  next to the grave of his adopted son Morrison  Izzy  Marshall  Lois Marshall moved to Arizona and remained widowed the rest of her life  living on her husband s pension and the $50 000 she earned by selling his memoir to the Bobbs Merrill publishing company  She died in 1958 and was interred next to her husband   5  Humor  Marshall was known for his quick wit and a good sense of humor  On hearing of his nomination as vice president  he announced that he was not surprised  as  Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents  home of more second class men than any other state   One of his favorite jokes was about a woman with two sons  one of whom went to sea and one of whom was elected vice president  neither was ever heard of again  On his election as vice president  he sent Woodrow Wilson a book  inscribed  From your only Vice    His humor caused him trouble during his time in Washington  He was known to greet citizens walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them   If you look on me as a wild animal  be kind enough to throw peanuts at me   This prompted Wilson to move Marshall s office to the Senate Office building  where he would not be disturbed by visitors  In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala  Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington  When asked why  he replied that  judging by the looks of the people walking on the street  they should be able find buried cave men no more than six feet down  The joke was not well received  and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year   His serious remarks could get him in trouble as well  Some of his public utterances in 1913  in which he appeared to advocate radical ideas in regard to the inheritance of property  caused much criticism   Marshall s wit is best remembered from a phrase he introduced to the American lexicon  During a Senate debate in 1917  as Senator Joseph L  Bristow cataloged a long list of what he felt the country needed  Marshall leaned over to one of his clerks and said   What this country needs is more of this  what this country needs is more of that   He then quipped  loudly enough for most of the chamber to hear   What this country needs is a really good five cent cigar   which provoked laughter from a number of senators   6  Legacy  The situation that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson  for which Marshall s vice presidency is most remembered  revived the national debate on the process of presidential succession  The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe  which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence  Wilson s incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue  The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841  but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem  Nearly fifty years later  the Twenty fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed  allowing the vice president to assume the presidency any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the duties of the office   Historians have varied interpretations of Marshall s vice presidency  Claire Suddath rated Marshall as one of the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time Magazine article  Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties  assumed the presidency  and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920  the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler  which began in the following year  Morison and a number of other historians claim that Marshall s decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War  Charles Thomas  one of Marshall s biographers  wrote that although Marshall s assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely  modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall  who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office  even temporarily   7  Electoral history  United States presidential
