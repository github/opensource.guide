Vannevar Bush     March 11  1890 – June 28  1974  was an American engineer  inventor and science administrator  whose most important contribution was as head of the U S  Office of Scientific Research and Development  OSRD  during World War II  through which almost all wartime military R&D was carried out  including initiation and early administration of the Manhattan Project  He is also known in engineering for his work on analog computers  for founding Raytheon  and for the memex  an adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of the World Wide Web  In 1945  Bush published As We May Think in which he predicted that  wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear  ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them  ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified   The memex influenced generations of computer scientists  who drew inspiration from its vision of the future   For his master s thesis  Bush invented and patented a  profile tracer   a mapping device for assisting surveyors  It was the first of a string of inventions  He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  in 1919  and founded the company now known as Raytheon in 1922  Starting in 1927  Bush constructed a differential analyzer  an analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables  An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the beginning of digital circuit design theory  Bush became Vice President of MIT and Dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932  and president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938   Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA  in 1938  and soon became its chairman  As Chairman of the National Defense Research Committee  NDRC   and later Director of OSRD  Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare  Bush was a well known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II  when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor  As head of NDRC and OSRD  he initiated the Manhattan Project  and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government  In Science  The Endless Frontier  his 1945 report to the President of the United States  Bush called for an expansion of government support for science  and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation   1  Early life and work  Vannevar Bush was born in Everett  Massachusetts  on March 11  1890  the third child and only son of Perry Bush  the local Universalist pastor  and his wife Emma Linwood née Paine  He was named after John Vannevar  an old friend of the family who had attended Tufts College with Perry  The family moved to Chelsea  Massachusetts  in 1892  and Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909  He then attended Tufts College  like his father before him  A popular student  he was vice president of his sophomore class  and president of his junior class  During his senior year  he managed the football team  He became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity  and dated Phoebe Clara Davis  who also came from Chelsea  Tufts allowed students to gain a master s degree in four years simultaneously with a bachelor s degree  so for his master s thesis  Bush invented and patented a  profile tracer   This was a device for assisting surveyors that looked like a lawn mower  It had two bicycle wheels  and a pen that plotted the terrain over which it traveled  It was the first of a string of inventions  On graduation in 1913 he received both bachelor of science and master of science degrees   After graduation  Bush worked at General Electric  GE  in Schenectady  New York  for $14 a week  As a  test man   his job was to assess equipment to ensure that it was safe  He transferred to GE s plant in Pittsfield  Massachusetts  to work on high voltage transformers  but after a fire broke out at the plant  Bush and the other test men were suspended  He returned to Tufts in October 1914 to teach mathematics  and spent the 1915 summer break working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard as an electrical inspector  He was awarded a $1 500 scholarship to study at Clark University as a doctoral student of Arthur Gordon Webster  but Webster wanted Bush to study acoustics  Bush preferred to quit rather than study a subject that did not interest him  and he subsequently enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  electrical engineering program  Spurred by the need for enough financial security to marry  he submitted his thesis  entitled Oscillating Current Circuits  An Extension of the Theory of Generalized Angular Velocities  with Applications to the Coupled Circuit and the Artificial Transmission Line  in April 1916  His adviser  Arthur Edwin Kennelly  tried to demand more work from him  but Bush refused  and Kennelly was overruled by the department chairman  Bush received his doctorate in engineering jointly from MIT and Harvard University  He married Phoebe in August 1916  Their marriage produced two sons  Richard Davis Bush and John Hathaway Bush   Bush accepted a job with Tufts  where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation  AMRAD   which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8  1916  The station owner  Harold Power  hired him to run the company s laboratory  at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts  In 1917  following the United States  entry into World War I  he went to work with the National Research Council  He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth s magnetic field  His device worked as designed  but only from a wooden ship  attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed   Bush left Tufts in 1919  although he remained employed by AMRAD  and joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT  where he worked under Dugald C  Jackson  In 1922  he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H  Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering  an introductory textbook  AMRAD s lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled  and Bush attempted to reverse the company s fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer  an AMRAD technician  on his own time  AMRAD s management was not interested in the device  but had no objection to its sale  Bush found backing from Laurence K  Marshall and Richard S  Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company  which hired Bush as a consultant  The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars  It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931  and with Texas Instruments in 1959  Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006  and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010   In 1924  Bush and Marshall teamed up with physicist Charles G  Smith  who had invented a device called the S tube  This enabled radios  which had previously required two different types of batteries  to operate from mains power  Marshall raised $25 000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7  1922  to market the invention  with Bush and Smith among its five directors  The venture made Bush wealthy  and the company  now known as Raytheon  ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor   Starting in 1927  Bush constructed a differential analyzer  an analog computer that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables  This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R  Stewart  one of Bush s masters students  who at Bush s suggestion created the integraph  a device for solving first order differential equations  in 1925  Another student  Harold Hazen  proposed extending the device to handle second order differential equations  Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention  for these were much more difficult to solve  but also quite common in physics  Under Bush s supervision  Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer  a table like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation  Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical  the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components  Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric s Edith Clarke  who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission  For developing the differential analyzer  Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute s Louis E  Levy Medal in 1928   An offshoot of the work at MIT was the beginning of digital circuit design theory by one of Bush s graduate students  Claude Shannon  Working on the analytical engine  Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master s thesis  A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits  In 1935  Bush was approached by OP 20 G  which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking  Bush was paid a $10 000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine  RAM   The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938  when it was found to be unreliable in service  Nonetheless  it was an important step toward creating such a device   The reform of the administration of MIT began in 1930 with the appointment of Karl T  Compton as president  Bush and Compton soon clashed over the issue of limiting the amount of outside consultancy by professors  a battle Bush quickly lost  but the two men soon built a solid professional relationship  Compton appointed Bush to the newly created post of vice president in 1932  That year Bush also became the dean of the MIT School of Engineering  The two positions came with a salary of $12 000 plus $6 000 for expenses per annum   2  World War II  2 1  Carnegie Institution for Science  In May 1938  Bush accepted a prestigious appointment as president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington  CIW   which had been founded in Washington  D C  Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science  it had an endowment of $33 million  and annually spent $1 5 million in research  most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories  Bush became its president on January 1  1939  with a salary of $25 000  He was now able to influence research policy in the United States at the highest level  and could informally advise the government on scientific matters  Bush soon discovered that the CIW had serious financial problems  and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding   Bush clashed over leadership of the institute with Cameron Forbes  CIW s chairman of the board  and with his predecessor  John Merriam  who continued to offer unwanted advice  A major embarrassment to them all was Harry H  Laughlin  the head of the Eugenics Record Office  whose activities Merriam had attempted to curtail without success  Bush made it a priority to remove him  regarding him as a scientific fraud  and one of his first acts was to ask for a review of Laughlin s work  In June 1938  Bush asked Laughlin to retire  offering him an annuity  which Laughlin reluctantly accepted  The Eugenics Record Office was renamed the Genetics Record Office  its funding was drastically cut  and it was closed completely in 1944  Senator Robert Reynolds attempted to get Laughlin reinstated  but Bush informed the trustees that an inquiry into Laughlin would  show him to be physically incapable of directing an office  and an investigation of his scientific standing would be equally conclusive    Bush wanted the institute to concentrate on hard science  He gutted Carnegie s archeology program  setting the field back many years in the United States  He saw little value in the humanities and social sciences  and slashed funding for Isis  a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence  Bush later explained that  I have a great reservation about these studies where somebody goes out and interviews a bunch of people and reads a lot of stuff and writes a book and puts it on a shelf and nobody ever reads it    2 2  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  On August 23  1938  Bush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA   the predecessor of NASA  Its chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames became ill  and Bush  as vice chairman  soon had to act in his place  In December 1938  NACA asked for $11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale  California  to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory  The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations  This decision was supported by the Chief of the United States Army Air Corps  Major General Henry H  Arnold  and by the head of the Navy s Bureau of Aeronautics  Rear Admiral Arthur B  Cook  who between them were planning to spend $225 million on new aircraft in the year ahead  However  Congress was not convinced of its value  and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5  1939  It was a frustrating experience for Bush  since he had never appeared before Congress before  and the Senators were not swayed by his arguments  Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center  now known as the Ames Research Center  was finally approved  By this time  war had broken out in Europe  and the inferiority of American aircraft engines was apparent  NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio  which became the Glenn Research Center  Following Ames s retirement in October 1939  Bush became Chairman of NACA  with George J  Mead as his deputy  Bush remained a member of NACA until November 1948   2 3  National Defense Research Committee  During World War II  Bush had become aware of poor cooperation between civilian scientists and the military  Concerned about the lack of coordination in scientific research and the requirements of defense mobilization  Bush proposed the creation of a general directive agency in the federal government  which he discussed with his colleagues  He had the secretary of NACA prepare a draft of the proposed National Defense Research Committee  NDRC  to be presented to Congress  but after the Germans invaded France in May 1940  Bush decided speed was important and approached President Franklin D  Roosevelt directly  Through the president s uncle  Frederic Delano  Bush managed to set up a meeting with Roosevelt on June 12  1940  to which he brought a single sheet of paper describing the agency  Roosevelt approved the proposal in 15 minutes  writing  OK   FDR  on the sheet   With Bush as chairman  NDRC was functioning even before the agency was officially established by order of the Council of National Defense on June 27  1940  The organization operated financially on a hand to mouth basis with monetary support from the president s emergency fund  Bush appointed four leading scientists to the NDRC  Karl T  Compton  President of MIT   James B  Conant  President of Harvard University   Frank B  Jewett  President of the National Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Board of Directors of Bell Laboratories   and Richard C  Tolman  Dean of the graduate school at Caltech   Rear Admiral Harold G  Bowen  Sr  and Brigadier General George V  Strong represented the military  The civilians already knew each other well  which allowed the organization to begin functioning straight away  The NDRC established itself in the administration building at the Carnegie Institution of Washington  Each member of the committee was assigned an area of responsibility  while Bush handled coordination  A small number of projects reported to him directly  such as the S 1 Uranium Committee  Compton s deputy  Alfred Loomis  said that  Of the men whose death in the summer of 1940 would have been the greatest calamity for America  the President is first  and Dr  Bush would be second or third    Bush was fond of saying that  if he made any important contribution to the war effort at all  it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing   He established a cordial relationship with the Secretary of War  Henry L  Stimson  and Stimson s assistant Harvey H  Bundy  who found Bush  impatient  and  vain   but said he was  one of the most important  able men I ever knew   Bush s relationship with the Navy was more turbulent  Bowen  the Director of the Naval Research Laboratory  NRL   saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival  and recommended abolishing it  A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships  and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen s personnel file  After the war  Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the Navy   On August 31  1940  Bush met with Henry Tizard  and arranged a series of meetings between the NDRC and the Tizard Mission  a British scientific delegation  At a meeting On September 19  1940  the Americans described Loomis and Compton s microwave research  They had an experimental 10 cm wavelength short wave radar  but admitted that it did not have enough power and that they were at a dead end  Taffy Bowen and John Cockcroft of the Tizard Mission then produced a cavity magnetron  a device far in advance of anything the Americans had ever seen  with an amazing power output of around 10 KW at 10 cm  enough to spot the periscope of a surfaced submarine at night from an aircraft  To exploit the invention  Bush decided to create a special laboratory  The NDRC allocated the new laboratory a budget of $455 000 for its first year  Loomis suggested that the lab should be run by the Carnegie Institution  but Bush convinced him that it would best be run by MIT  The Radiation Laboratory  as it came to be known  tested its airborne radar from an Army B 18 on March 27  1940  By mid 1941  it had developed SCR 584 radar  a mobile radar fire control system for antiaircraft guns   In September 1940  Norbert Wiener approached Bush with a proposal to build a digital computer  Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it on the grounds that he did not believe that it could be completed before the end of the war  The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision  which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology  In June 1943  the Army provided $500 000 to build the computer  which became ENIAC  the first general purpose electronic computer  Having delayed its funding  Bush s prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945  after the war had ended  His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision   2 4  Office of Scientific Research and Development  On June 28  1941  Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development  OSRD  with the signing of Executive Order 8807  Bush became director of the OSRD while Conant succeeded him as Chairman of the NDRC  which was subsumed into the OSRD  The OSRD was on a firmer financial footing than the NDRC since it received funding from Congress  and had the resources and the authority to develop weapons and technologies with or without the military  Furthermore  the OSRD had a broader mandate than the NDRC  moving into additional areas such as medical research and the mass production of penicillin and sulfa drugs  The organization grew to 850 full time employees  and produced between 30 000 and 35 000 reports  The OSRD was involved in some 2 500 contracts  worth in excess of $536 million   Bush s method of management at the OSRD was to direct overall policy  while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference  He attempted to interpret the mandate of the OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies  Bush would often ask   Will it help to win a war  this war   Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government  academic  and industrial facilities  His most difficult problems  and also greatest successes  were keeping the confidence of the military  which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions  and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces  This became especially difficult as the Army s manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944  In all  OSRD requested deferments for some 9 725 employees of OSRD contractors  of which all but 63 were granted  In his obituary  The New York Times described Bush as  a master craftsman at steering around obstacles  whether they were technical or political or bull headed generals and admirals    2 4 1  Proximity fuze  In August 1940  the NDRC began work on a proximity fuze  a fuze inside an artillery shell that would explode when it came close to its target  A radar set  along with the batteries to power it  was miniaturized to fit inside a shell  and its glass vacuum tubes designed to withstand the 20 000 g force of being fired from a gun and 500 rotations per second in flight  Unlike normal radar  the proximity fuze sent out a continuous signal rather than short pulses  The NDRC created a special Section T chaired by Merle Tuve of the CIW  with Commander William S  Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between the NDRC and the Navy s Bureau of Ordnance  BuOrd   In April 1942  Bush placed Section T directly under the OSRD  and Parsons in charge  The research effort remained under Tuve but moved to the Johns Hopkins University s Applied Physics Laboratory  APL   where Parsons was BuOrd s representative  In August 1942  a live firing test was conducted with the newly commissioned cruiser   three pilotless drones were shot down in succession   To preserve the secret of the proximity fuze  its use was initially permitted only over water  where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands  In late 1943  the Army obtained permission to use the weapon over land  The proximity fuze proved particularly effective against the V 1 flying bomb over England  and later Antwerp  in 1944  A version was also developed for use with howitzers against ground targets  Bush met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1944 to press for its use  arguing that the Germans would be unable to copy and produce it before the war was over  Eventually  the Joint Chiefs agreed to allow its employment from December 25  In response to the German Ardennes Offensive on December 16  1944  the immediate use of the proximity fuze was authorized  and it went into action with deadly effect  By the end of 1944  VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40 000 per day   If one looks at the proximity fuze program as a whole   historian James Phinney Baxter III wrote   the magnitude and complexity of the effort rank it among the three or four most extraordinary scientific achievements of the war    The German V 1 flying bomb demonstrated a serious omission in OSRD s portfolio  guided missiles  While the OSRD had some success developing unguided rockets  it had nothing comparable to the V 1  the V 2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air to ship gliding guided bomb  Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas  this represented an entire field that had been left to the enemy  Bush did not seek the advice of Dr  Robert H  Goddard  Goddard would come to be regarded as America s pioneer of rocketry  but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank  Before the war  Bush had gone on the record as saying   I don t understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets   but in May 1944  he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V 1 and V 2  Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed  which was done   2 4 2  Manhattan Project  Bush played a critical role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb  When the NDRC was formed  the Committee on Uranium was placed under it  reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee  Bush reorganized the committee  strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve  George B  Pegram  Jesse W  Beams  Ross Gunn and Harold Urey  When the OSRD was formed in June 1941  the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush  For security reasons  its name was soon changed to the S 1 Section   Bush met with Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A  Wallace on October 9  1941  to discuss the project  He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys  the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee  which had concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible  and on the German nuclear energy project  about which little was known  Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program  To control it  he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace  Bush  Conant  Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army  General George Marshall  On Bush s advice  Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy  although the Navy had shown far more interest in the field  and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships  Bush s negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would not listen to his advice  and could not handle large scale construction projects   In March 1942  Bush sent a report to Roosevelt outlining work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium 235  Oppenheimer s calculations  which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check  estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium 235 was in the range of 2 5 to 5 kilograms  with a destructive power of around 2 000 tons of TNT  Moreover  it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile  After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D  Clay about the construction requirements  Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants  which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17  1942  With the Army on board  Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD  replacing the S 1 Section with a new S 1 Executive Committee   Bush soon became dissatisfied with the dilatory way the project was run  with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants  He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA 3 priority  which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months  Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P  Patterson  Major General Brehon B  Somervell  the commander of the Army s Services of Supply  appointed Brigadier General Leslie R  Groves as project director in September  Within days of taking over  Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge  Tennessee  and obtained a AAA priority  At a meeting in Stimson s office on September 23 attended by Bundy  Bush  Conant  Groves  Marshall Somervell and Stimson  Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top Policy Group  The meeting agreed with Bush  and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him  with Somervell s Chief of Staff  Brigadier General Wilhelm D  Styer  representing the Army  and Rear Admiral William R  Purnell representing the Navy   At the meeting with Roosevelt on October 9  1941  Bush advocated cooperating with the United Kingdom  and he began corresponding with his British counterpart  Sir John Anderson  But by October 1942  Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage  Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British should be limited to technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post war developments  In July 1943  on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology  Bush  Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson  Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street  At the meeting  Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange  while Bush defended current policy  Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British  The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects  creating a Combined Policy Committee with Stimson  Bush and Conant as United States representatives   Bush appeared on the cover of Time magazine on April 3  1944  He toured the Western Front in October 1944  and spoke to ordnance officers  but no senior commander would meet with him  He was able to meet with Samuel Goudsmit and other members of the Alsos Mission  who assured him that there was no danger from the German project  he conveyed this assessment to Lieutenant General Bedell Smith  In May 1945  Bush became part of the Interim Committee formed to advise the new President  Harry S  Truman  on nuclear weapons  It advised that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning  Bush was present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on July 16  1945  for the Trinity nuclear test  the first detonation of an atomic bomb  Afterwards  he took his hat off to Oppenheimer in tribute   In As We May Think  an essay published by the Atlantic Monthly in July 1945  Bush wrote   This has not been a scientist s war  it has been a war in which all have had a part  The scientists  burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause  have shared greatly and learned much  It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership    3  Post war years  3 1  Memex concept  Bush introduced the concept of the memex during the 1930s  which he imagined as a form of memory augmentation involving a microfilm based  device in which an individual stores all his books  records  and communications  and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility  It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory   He wanted the memex to emulate the way the brain links data by association rather than by indexes and traditional  hierarchical storage paradigms  and be easily accessed as  a future device for individual use     a sort of mechanized private file and library  in the shape of a desk  The memex was also intended as a tool to study the brain itself   After thinking about the potential of augmented memory for several years  Bush set out his thoughts at length in As We May Think  predicting that  wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear  ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them  ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified   A few months later  Life magazine published a condensed version of As We May Think  accompanied by several illustrations showing the possible appearance of a memex machine and its companion devices   Shortly after As We May Think was originally published  Douglas Engelbart read it  and with Bush s visions in mind  commenced work that would later lead to the invention of the mouse  Ted Nelson  who coined the terms  hypertext  and  hypermedia   was also greatly influenced by Bush s essay   As We May Think has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay  In their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline  Bill Johnston and Sheila Webber wrote in 2005 that  Bush was concerned that information overload might inhibit the research efforts of scientists  Looking to the future  he predicted a time when  there is a growing mountain of research  But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends  The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers    3 2  National Science Foundation  The OSRD continued to function actively until some time after the end of hostilities  but by 1946–47 it had been reduced to a minimal staff charged with finishing work remaining from the war period  Bush was calling for its closure even before the war had ended  During the war  the OSRD had issued contracts as it had seen fit  with just eight organisations accounting for half of its spending  MIT was the largest to receive funds  with its obvious ties to Bush and his close associates  Efforts to obtain legislation exempting the OSRD from the usual government conflict of interest regulations failed  leaving Bush and other OSRD principals open to prosecution  Bush therefore pressed for OSRD to be wound up as soon as possible   With its dissolution  Bush and others had hoped that an equivalent peacetime government research and development agency would replace the OSRD  Bush felt that basic research was important to national survival for both military and commercial reasons  requiring continued government support for science and technology  technical superiority could be a deterrent to future enemy aggression  In Science  The Endless Frontier  a July 1945 report to the president  Bush maintained that basic research was  the pacemaker of technological progress    New products and new processes do not appear full grown   Bush wrote in the report   They are founded on new principles and new conceptions  which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms of science   In Bush s view  the  purest realms  were the physical and medical sciences  he did not propose funding the social sciences  In Science  The Endless Frontier  science historian Daniel Kevles later wrote  Bush  insisted upon the principle of Federal patronage for the advancement of knowledge in the United States  a departure that came to govern Federal science policy after World War II    In July 1945  the Kilgore bill was introduced in Congress  proposing the appointment and removal of a single science administrator by the president  with emphasis on applied research  and a patent clause favoring a government monopoly  In contrast  the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush s proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them  The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights  A compromise Kilgore–Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in the House because Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of the original Magnuson bill  A Senate bill was introduced in February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation  NSF  to replace the OSRD  This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush  including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board  The bill passed the Senate and the House  but was pocket vetoed by Truman on August 6  on the grounds that the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress  The OSRD was abolished without a successor organization on December 31  1947   Without a National Science Foundation  the military stepped in  with the Office of Naval Research  ONR  filling the gap  The war had accustomed many scientists to working without the budgetary constraints imposed by pre war universities  Bush helped create the Joint Research and Development Board  JRDB  of the Army and Navy  of which he was chairman  With passage of the National Security Act on July 26  1947  the JRDB became the Research and Development Board  RDB   Its role was to promote research through the military until a bill creating the National Science Foundation finally became law  By 1953  the Department of Defense was spending $1 6 billion a year on research  physicists were spending 70 percent of their time on defense related research  and 98 percent of the money spent on physics came from either the Department of Defense or the Atomic Energy Commission  AEC   which took over from the Manhattan Project on January 1  1947  Legislation to create the National Science Foundation finally passed through Congress and was signed into law by Truman in 1950   The authority that Bush had as chairman of the RDB was much different from the power and influence he enjoyed as director of OSRD and would have enjoyed in the agency he had hoped would be independent of the Executive branch and Congress  He was never happy with the position and resigned as chairman of the RDB after a year  but remained on the oversight committee  He continued to be skeptical about rockets and missiles  writing in his 1949 book  Modern Arms and Free Men  that intercontinental ballistic missiles would not be technically feasible  for a long time to come     if ever    3 3  Later life  With Truman as president  men like John R  Steelman  who was appointed Chairman of the President s Scientific Research Board in October 1946  came to prominence  Bush s authority  both among scientists and politicians  suffered a rapid decline  though he remained a revered figure  In September 1949  he was appointed to head a scientific panel that included Oppenheimer to review the evidence that the Soviet Union had tested its first atomic bomb  The panel concluded that it had  and this finding was relayed to Truman  who made the public announcement  Bush was outraged when a security hearing stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954  he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer s accusers in the New York Times  Alfred Friendly summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become  the Grand Old Man of American science    Bush continued to serve on the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines  He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry  which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel efficient engines  General Motors told him that  even if it were a better engine   General Motors  would not be interested in it   Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising   Madison Avenue believes   he said   that if you tell the public something absurd  but do it enough times  the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities    From 1947 to 1962  Bush was on the board of directors for American Telephone and Telegraph  He retired as president of the Carnegie Institution and returned to Massachusetts in 1955  but remained a director of Metals and Controls Corporation from 1952 to 1959  and of Merck & Co  from 1949 to 1962  Bush became chairman of the board at Merck following the death of George W  Merck  serving until 1962  He worked closely with the company s president  Max Tishler  although Bush was concerned about Tishler s reluctance to delegate responsibility  Bush distrusted the company s sales organisation  but supported Tishler s research and development efforts  He was a trustee of Tufts College from 1943 to 1962  of Johns Hopkins University from 1943 to 1955  of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1939 to 1950  the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1958 to 1974  and the George Putnam Fund of Boston from 1956 to 1972  and was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1943 to 1955   Bush received the AIEE s Edison Medal in 1943   for his contribution to the advancement of electrical engineering  particularly through the development of new applications of mathematics to engineering problems  and for his eminent service to the nation in guiding the war research program   In 1945  Bush was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences  In 1949  he received the IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute in recognition of his contributions as a leader of research and development  President Truman awarded Bush the Medal of Merit with bronze oak leaf cluster in 1948  President Lyndon Johnson awarded him the National Medal of Science in 1963  and President Richard Nixon presented him with the Atomic Pioneers Award from the Atomic Energy Commission in February 1970  Bush was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1948  and an Officer of the French Legion of Honor in 1955   Bush was an alleged member of the Majestic 12  a committee of scientists  military leaders  and government officials  formed in 1947 by an executive order by U S  President Harry S  Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft   After suffering a stroke  Bush died in Belmont  Massachusetts  at the age of 84 from pneumonia on June 28  1974  He was survived by his sons Richard  a surgeon  and John  president of Millipore Corporation  and by six grandchildren and his sister Edith  Bush s wife had died in 1969  He was buried at South Dennis Cemetery in South Dennis  Massachusetts  after a private funeral service  At a public memorial subsequently held by MIT  Jerome Wiesner declared  No American has had greater influence in the growth of science and technology than Vannevar Bush    In 1980  the National Science Foundation created the Vannevar Bush Award to honor his contributions to public service  The Vannevar Bush papers are located in several places  with the majority of the collection held at the Library of Congress  Additional papers are held by the MIT Institute Archives and Special Collections  the Carnegie Institution  and the National Archives and Records Administration   4  Bibliography   For a complete list of his published papers  see     5  Notes  6  References  7
