In common law legal systems  a trust is a relationship whereby property is held by one party for the benefit of another  A trust is created by a settlor  who transfers some or all of his or her property to a trustee  The trustee holds that property for the trust s beneficiaries  Trusts have existed since Roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law   An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee  separating the property s legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits  This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent  incapacitated  or dead  Trusts are frequently created in wills  defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries   The trustee is given legal title to the trust property  but is obligated to act for the good of the beneficiaries  The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed  but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties  Trustees who violate this fiduciary duty are self dealing  Courts can reverse self dealing actions  order profits returned  and impose other sanctions   The trustee may be either an individual  a company  or a public body  There may be a single trustee or multiple co trustees   The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created  In most jurisdictions  this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed   1  History  Roman law had a well developed concept of the trust  fideicommissum  in terms of  testamentary trusts  created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos  living  trusts which apply while the creator lives  This was created by later common law jurisdictions  The waqf is a similar institution in Islamic law  restricted to charitable trusts  Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades  during the 12th and 13th centuries  In medieval English trust law  the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use  or cestui que trust   At the time  land ownership in England was based on the feudal system  When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades  he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues  on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return  However  Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return  Unfortunately for the Crusader  English common law did not recognize his claim  As far as the King s courts were concerned  the land belonged to the trustee  who was under no obligation to return it  The Crusader had no legal claim  The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king  who would refer the matter to his Lord Chancellor  The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience  At this time  the principle of equity was born   The Lord Chancellor would consider it  unconscionable  that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader  the  true  owner   Therefore  he would find in favor of the returning Crusader  Over time  it became known that the Lord Chancellor s court  the Court of Chancery  would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader  The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner  and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested  The Crusader was the  beneficiary  and the acquaintance the  trustee   The term  use of land  was coined  and in time developed into what we now know as a trust    Antitrust law  emerged in the 19th century when industries created monopolistic trusts by entrusting their shares to a board of trustees in exchange for shares of equal value with dividend rights  these boards could then enforce a monopoly  However  trusts were used in this case because a corporation could not own other companies  stock and thereby become a holding company without a  special act of the legislature   Holding companies were used after the restriction on owning other companies  shares was lifted   2  Significance  The trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the English legal system  Today  trusts play a significant role in most common law systems  and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes  In Curaçao  for example  the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012  however  the Curaçao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument  France has recently added a similar  Roman law based device to its own law with the fiducie  amended in 2009  the fiducie  unlike a trust  is a contractual relationship  Trusts are widely used internationally  especially in countries within the English law sphere of influence  and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems  they do recognise the concept under the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition  partly only the extent that they are parties thereto   The Hague Convention also regulates conflict of trusts   Although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers  they have become very important in American capital markets  particularly through pension funds  essentially always trusts  and mutual funds  often trusts    3  Basic principles  3 1  Overview  Property of any sort may be held in a trust  The uses of trusts are many and varied  for both personal and commercial reasons  and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning  asset protection  and taxes  Living trusts may be created during a person s life  through the drafting of a trust instrument  or after death in a will   In a relevant sense  a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors  investors  are also the beneficiaries  This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust  which could theoretically  with the language in the  governing instrument   be organized as a cooperative corporation  limited liability corporation  or perhaps even a nonprofit corporation  although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used  One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee  multiple beneficiaries  and their respective creditors  particularly the trustee s creditors   making it  bankruptcy remote   and leading to its use in pensions  mutual funds  and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust   3 2  Terms  Appointer  This is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one  This person is usually mentioned in the trust deed   Appointment  In trust law   appointment  often has its everyday meaning  It is common to talk of  the appointment of a trustee   for example  However   appointment  also has a technical trust law meaning  either   the act of appointing  i e  giving  an asset from the trust to a beneficiary  usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust   or  the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment   As Trustee For  ATF   This is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee   Beneficiary  A beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns   In Its Own Capacity  IIOC   This term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting its own   Protector  A protector may be appointed in an express  inter vivos trust  as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another  The legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate  No one doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities  If a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees  However  a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one  Also  protectors are comparatively new  while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years  It is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties  and by others that they do not  The case law has not yet established this point   Settlor  This is the person who creates the trust   Trust deed  A trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee  beneficiaries  settlor and appointer  and the terms and conditions of the agreement   Trust distributions  A trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust   Trustee  A person  either an individual  a corporation or more than one of either  who administers a trust  A trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trust s beneficiaries   3 3  Creation  Trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor  express trusts  or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts  An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties  Implied trusts are divided into two categories  resulting and constructive  A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties  but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent  A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties  regardless of their intentions   Typically a trust can be created in the following ways   a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees  often referred to as an inter vivos or  living trust     an oral declaration   the will of a decedent  usually called a testamentary trust  or  a court order  for example in family proceedings   In some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document   3 4  Formalities  Generally  a trust requires three certainties  as determined in Knight v Knight   Intention  There must be a clear intention to create a trust  Re Adams and the Kensington Vestry   Subject Matter  The property subject to the trust must be clearly identified  Palmer v Simmonds   One may not  for example state  settle  the majority of my estate   as the precise extent cannot be ascertained  Trust property may be any form of specific property  be it real or personal  tangible or intangible  It is often  for example  real estate  shares or cash   Objects  The beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified  or at least be ascertainable  Re Hain s Settlement   In the case of discretionary trusts  where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be  the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries  McPhail v Doulton   Beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust  for example   my future grandchildren    Alternatively  the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries   3 5  Trustees  A trust may have multiple trustees  and these trustees are the legal owners of the trust s property  but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties  such as a duty of care and a duty to inform  If trustees do not adhere to these duties  they may be removed through a legal action  The trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company  but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees  A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument  If a trust lacks a trustee  a court may appoint a trustee   The trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust  The trust s affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust  accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries  filing required tax returns  and other duties  In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument  the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit  A trustee may be held personally liable for problems  although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased  For example  a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested  However  in the United States  similar to directors and officers  an exculpatory clause may minimize liability  although this was previously held to be against public policy  this position has changed   In the United States  the Uniform Trust Code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts  although trustees may be unpaid  Commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about 1% of assets under management   3 6  Beneficiaries  The beneficiaries are beneficial  or equitable  owners of the trust property  Either immediately or eventually  the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property  or they will receive the property itself  The extent of a beneficiary s interest depends on the wording of the trust document  One beneficiary may be entitled to income  for example  interest from a bank account   whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twenty five years  The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust  subject to some limitations imposed by law   4  Purposes  Common purposes for trusts include   Privacy  Trusts may be created purely for privacy  The terms of a will are public and the terms of a trust are not  In some families  this alone makes the use of trusts ideal   Spendthrift protection  Trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries  for example  one s children  against their own inability to handle money  These are especially attractive for spendthrifts  Courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors  but not against creditors of a settlor   Wills and estate planning  Trusts frequently appear in wills  indeed  technically  the administration of every deceased s estate is a form of trust   Conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceased s spouse  if any   and then to the children equally  If the children are under 18  or under some other age mentioned in the will  21 and 25 are common   a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached  The executor of the will is  usually  the trustee  and the children are the beneficiaries  The trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority   Charities  In some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts  In others  corporations may be charities also  In most jurisdictions  charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit  in England  for example  by the Charity Commission    Unit trusts  The trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle  the unit trust   Pension plans  Pension plans are typically set up as a trust  with the employer as settlor  and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries   Remuneration trusts  Trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents  This form of trust was developed by Paul Baxendale Walker and has since gained widespread use   Corporate structures  Complex business arrangements  most often in the finance and insurance sectors  sometimes use trusts among various other entities  e g   corporations  in their structure   Asset protection  Trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote  For example  a discretionary trust  of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary  but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary  In such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets  without owning them  and therefore in theory protected from creditors  In addition  the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name  e g    The Teddy Bear Trust    These strategies are ethically and legally controversial   Tax planning  The tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route  if  indeed  it would be possible to do so   In many cases  the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative  and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance  For an example see the  nil band discretionary trust   explained at Inheritance Tax  United Kingdom    Co ownership  Ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust  In particular  ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one  or both  owning the legal title as trustee   Construction law  In Canada and Minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust  In the event of contractor insolvency  this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed   5  Types  5 1  Alphabetic list of trust types  Trusts go by many different names  depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust  Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes  a single trust might accurately be described in several ways  For example  a living trust is often an express trust  which is also a revocable trust  and might include an incentive trust  and so forth   Constructive trust  Unlike an express trust  a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee  A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an  equitable remedy   This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing  where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it  A constructive trust is  essentially  a legal fiction  For example  a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff s request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them  The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing  and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization  The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust  the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust  The latter is an  equitable remedy  imposed by law being truly remedial  the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property   Discretionary trust  In a discretionary trust  certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary  i e   whether there is a  class  of beneficiaries  which a person can be said to belong to   In that way  persons who satisfy that criterion  who are members of that class  can enforce the trust  Re Baden’s Deed Trusts  McPhail v Doulton  Directed trust  In these types  a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trust s execution  these participants may include a distribution committee  trust protector  or investment advisor  The directed trustee s role is administrative which involves following investment instructions  holding legal title to the trust assets  providing fiduciary and tax accounting  coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants  Dynasty trust  also known as a generation skipping trust   A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor s grandchildren  not the grantor s children  The children of the grantor never take title to the assets  This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first  Generation skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor s children  however  because any income generated by the trust s assets can be made accessible to the grantor s children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren   Express trust  An express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust  over their assets  either now  or upon his or her later death  In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument  which will either be a will or a trust deed  Almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type  They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts  The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct  For an express trust to exist  there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property  In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value  or is real estate   Fixed trust  In a fixed trust  the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor  The trustee has little or no discretion  Common examples are   a trust for a minor   to x if she attains 21     a life interest   to pay the income to x for her lifetime    and  a remainder   to pay the capital to y after the death of x    Grantor retained annuity trust  GRAT   GRAT is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers asset s   as a gift  into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument  At the end of the term  the financial property is transferred  tax free  to the named beneficiaries  This trust is commonly used in the U S  to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax   Hybrid trust  A hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts  In a hybrid trust  the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor  But the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property  once these fixed amounts have been paid out  is to be paid to the beneficiaries   Implied trust  An implied trust  as distinct from an express trust  is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met  but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist  A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for  In such a case  the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor  the creator of the trust   In other words  the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document   Incentive trust  A trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary  The term  incentive trust  is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee   Inter vivos trust  or living trust   A settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust   Irrevocable trust  In contrast to a revocable trust  an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed  Although in rare cases  a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer  under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust   Offshore trust  Strictly speaking  an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident  However  the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or  colloquially  as tax havens  Offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries  but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions  By extension   onshore trust  has come to mean any trust resident in a high tax jurisdiction   Personal injury trust  A personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury   Private and public trusts  A private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary  By contrast  a public trust  also called a charitable trust  has some charitable end as its beneficiary  In order to qualify as a charitable trust  the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty  providing education  carrying out some religious purpose  etc  The permissible objects are generally set out in legislation  but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust  by analogy  Charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation   Protective trust  Here the terminology is different between the UK and the USA   In the UK  a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event  such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary  or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest  They have become comparatively rare   In the USA  a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning   In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust   Often a person  A  wishes to leave property to another person B  A  however  fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies  and that therefore B would receive none of it  A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary  but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died  Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation  A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries  with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died  and thereafter to allow its use to B  The property is then safe from being claimed by A creditors  at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust s establishment  This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders  and are frequently used as alternatives to them   Purpose trust  Or  more accurately  non charitable purpose trust  all charitable trusts are purpose trusts   Generally  the law does not permit non charitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law  and  arguable  Quistclose trusts   Certain jurisdictions  principally  offshore jurisdictions  have enacted legislation validating non charitable purpose trusts generally   QTIP Trust  Short for  qualified terminal interest property   A trust recognized under the tax laws of the United States which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax   Resulting trust  A resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  1  a trust fails  wholly or in part  as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets  or  2  a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting  B becomes the resulting trustee of A s payment   Revocable trust  A trust of this kind may be amended  altered or revoked by its settlor at any time  provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated  Revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the US as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a person s final affairs after death   Secret trust  A post mortem trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one  or more  legatees of a will   Simple trust   In the US jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings   In a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust  This is also called a bare trust  All other trusts are special trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this   A simple trust in Federal income tax law is one in which  under the terms of the trust document  all net income must be distributed on an annual basis   In the UK a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust  Bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors  Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales  or 16 in Scotland   Special trust  In the US  a special trust  also called complex trust  contrasts with a simple trust  see above   It does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year  The funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes   Special Power of Appointment trust  SPA Trust   A trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features   Spendthrift trust  It is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending  It gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary   Standby Trust  or Pourover Trust   The trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death  This is a statutory trust   Testamentary trust  or Will Trust   A trust created in an individual s will is called a testamentary trust  Because a will can become effective only upon death  a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlor s death   Unit trust  A trust where the beneficiaries  called unitholders  each possess a certain share  called units  and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess  A unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment  rather than disposition  as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary   6  Regional variations  Trusts originated in England  and therefore English trusts law has had a significant influence  particularly among common law legal systems such as the United States and the countries of the Commonwealth   Trust law in civil law jurisdictions  generally including Continental Europe  typically does not exist  but arises due to conflict of laws  Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that European countries have been reluctant to adopt trusts   6 1  United States  State law applies to trusts  and the Uniform Trust Code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states  In addition  federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the Internal Revenue Service may affect the structure and creation of trusts  The common law of trusts is summarized in the Restatements of the Law  such as the Restatement of Trusts  Third  2003−08    In the United States the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations  partnerships  or not at all depending on the circumstances  although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations  For example  the trust preferred security is a hybrid  debt and equity  security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks  balance sheets  The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of  large  banks  regulatory capital   6 1 1  Estate planning  Living trusts  as opposed to testamentary  will  trusts  avoid probate  Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular  The probate courts may charge a fee based on a percentage net worth of the deceased time  and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private  Both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability  by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will   Negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses  the expense of trust administration  and a lack of certain safeguards  The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the one time lump sum fee of 1 to 4% for probate  which applies regardless of whether lack of drafted will  Unlike trusts  wills must be signed by two to three witnesses  the number depending on state law  Legal protections which apply to probate and not trusts include provisions which protect the decedent s assets from mismanagement or embezzlement  such as requirements of bonding  insurance  and itemized accountings of probate assets   6 1 2  Estate tax effect  Living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the U S  federal estate tax  Married couples may  however  effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause   For a living trust  the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust  such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument  Living trusts also  in practical terms  tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations  If a living trust fails  the property will usually be held for the grantor settlor on resulting trusts  which in some notable cases  has had catastrophic tax consequences   6 2  South Africa  In many ways trusts in South Africa operate similarly to other common law countries  although the law of South Africa is actually a hybrid of the British common law system and Roman Dutch law   In South Africa  in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’  inherited from the Roman Dutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber  in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust  although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust  Bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages   In South Africa  minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution  the Guardian s Fund  and released to the children in adulthood  Therefore testamentary  will  trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children   There are two types of living trusts in South Africa  namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts  In vested trusts  the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed  whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit   6 2 1  Asset protection  Until recently  there were tax advantages to living trusts in South Africa  although most of these advantages have been removed  Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage  With notable exceptions  assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries  the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust  Under the Insolvency Act  Act 24 of 1936   assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer  or 24 months if he she is insolvent at the time of transfer  After 24 months  creditors have no claim against assets in the trust  although they can attempt to attach the loan account  thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets  Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust  through a loan granted to the trust  or donating cash to it  any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax  20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year    6 2 2  Tax considerations  Under South African law living trusts are considered tax payers  Two types of tax apply to living trusts  namely income tax and capital gains tax  CGT   A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40%  individuals pay according to income scales  usually less than 20%   The trust s income can  however  be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary  A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20%  individuals pay 10%   Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax  although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate  in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax    The taxpayer whose residence has been ‘locked’ into a trust has now been given another opportunity to take advantage of these CGT exemptions  The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 Sept  2009 commenced on 1 Jan  2010 and granted a 2 year window period from 1 Jan  2010 to 31 Dec  2011 affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences  Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter   7  See also  Blind trust
