The demographics of North Korea  a country in eastern Asia  are known through national censuses and international estimates  The Central Bureau of Statistics of North Korea conducted the most recent census in 2008  where the population reached 24 million inhabitants  The population density is 199 54 inhabitants per square kilometre  and the 2014 estimated life expectancy is 69 81 years  In 1980  the population rose at a near consistent  but low  rate  0 84% from the two censuses   Since 2000  North Korea s birth rate has exceeded its death rate  the natural growth is positive  In terms of age structure  the population is dominated by the 15–64 year old segment  68 09%   The median age of the population is 32 9 years  and the gender ratio is 0 95 males to 1 00 female   According to The World Factbook  North Korea is racially homogeneous and contains a small Chinese community and a few ethnic Japanese  The 2008 census listed two nationalities  Korean  %  and Other  %   Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910  in which the Korean peninsula was occupied by Japanese  In 1945  when Japan was defeated in World War II  Korea was divided into two occupied zones  North occupied by the Soviet Union and the South by the United States  Negotiations on unification failed  and in 1948 two separate countries were formed  North and South Korea   Korean is the official language of North Korea  The World Factbook states  traditionally Buddhist and Confucianist  some Christian and syncretic Chondogyo  in regards to religion  but also states  autonomous religious activities now almost nonexistent  government sponsored religious groups exist to provide illusion of religious freedom   As of 2008  8 86% of the population older than 5 years old have attained academic degrees  In 2000  North Korea spent 38 2% of its expenditures on education  social insurance  and social security  Estimates show that  in 2012  gross domestic product  GDP  per capita was $1 800  The most significant sources of employment was Machine building and manufacturing of metallurgical products  military products  and textiles  In 2006  the unemployment rate was between 14 7% and 36 5%  The 2008 census enumerated 5 887 471 households  averaging 3 9 persons per house  Average urbanization rate was 60 3% in 2011   1  History of reporting demographics  Until the release of official data in 1989  the 1963 edition of the North Korea Central Yearbook was the last official publication to disclose population figures  After 1963 demographers used varying methods to estimate the population  They either totaled the number of delegates elected to the Supreme People s Assembly  each delegate representing 50 000 people before 1962 and 30 000 people afterward  or relied on official statements that a certain number of persons  or percentage of the population  was engaged in a particular activity  Thus  on the basis of remarks made by President Kim Il Sung in 1977 concerning school attendance  the population that year was calculated at 17 2 million persons  During the 1980s  health statistics  including life expectancy and causes of mortality  were gradually made available to the outside world   In 1989 the Central Statistics Bureau released demographic data to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities  UNFPA  to secure the UNFPA s assistance in holding North Korea s first nationwide census since the establishment of the DPRK in 1946  Although the figures given to the United Nations  UN  might have been purposely distorted  it appears that in line with other attempts to open itself to the outside world  the North Korean regime has also opened somewhat in the demographic realm  Although the country lacks trained demographers  accurate data on household registration  migration  and births and deaths are available to North Korean authorities  According to the United States scholar Nicholas Eberstadt and demographer Judith Banister  vital statistics and personal information on residents are kept by agencies on the ri  or ni      village  the local administrative unit  level in rural areas and the dong      district or block  level in urban areas   2  Size and growth rate  In their 1992 monograph  The Population of North Korea  Eberstadt and Banister use the data given to the UNFPA and make their own assessments  They place the total population at 21 4 million persons in mid 1990  consisting of 10 6 million males and 10 8 million females  This figure is close to an estimate of 21 9 million persons for mid 1988 cited in the 1990 edition of the Demographic Yearbook published by the UN  Korean Review  a book by Pan Hwan Ju published by the P yongyang Foreign Languages Press in 1987  gives a figure of 19 1 million persons for 1986   2 1  Male female ratio  The figures disclosed by the government reveal an unusually low proportion of males to females  in 1980 and 1987  the male to female ratios were 86 2 to 100  and 84 2 to 100  respectively  Low male to female ratios are usually the result of a war  but these figures were lower than the sex ratio of 88 3 males per 100 females recorded for 1953  the last year of the Korean War  The male to female ratio would be expected to rise to a normal level with the passage of years  as happened between 1953 and 1970  when the figure was 95 1 males per 100 females  After 1970  however  the ratio declined  Eberstadt and Banister suggest that before 1970 male and female population figures included the whole population  yielding ratios in the ninetieth percentile  but that after that time the male military population was excluded from population figures  Based on the figures provided by the Central Statistics Bureau  Eberstadt and Banister estimate that the actual size of the  hidden  male North Korean military had reached 1 2 million by 1986 and that the actual male to female ratio was 97 1 males to 100 females in 1990  If their estimates are correct  6 1 percent of North Korea s total population was in the military  numerically the world s fifth largest military force  in the late 1980s  fourth largest as of 2006    2 2  Growth rate  The annual population growth rate in 1960 was 2 7 percent  rising to a high of 3 6 percent in 1970  and falling to 1 9 percent in 1975  This fall reflected a dramatic decline in the fertility rate  the average number of children born to women decreased from 6 5 in 1966 to 2 5 in 1988  Assuming the data is reliable  reasons for falling growth rates and fertility rates probably include late marriage  urbanization  limited housing space  and the expectation that women would participate equally in work hours in the labor force  The experience of other socialist countries suggests that widespread labor force participation by women often goes hand in hand with more traditional role expectations  in other words  they are still responsible for housework and childrearing  The high percentage of males age 17 to 26 may have contributed to the low fertility rate  According to Eberstadt and Banister s data  the annual population growth rate in 1991 was 1 9 percent  However  the CIA World Fact Book estimated that North Korea s annual population growth rate was 1 0% in 1991 and that it has since declined to 0 4% by 2009   2 3  Promoting population growth  The North Korean government seems to perceive its population as too small in relation to that of South Korea  In its public pronouncements  P yongyang has called for accelerated population growth and encouraged large families  According to one Korean American scholar who visited North Korea in the early 1980s  the country has no birth control policies  parents are encouraged to have as many as six children  The state provides t agaso  nurseries  to lessen the burden of childrearing for parents and offers a 77 day paid leave after childbirth  Eberstadt and Banister suggest  however  that authorities at the local level make contraceptive information readily available to parents and that intrauterine devices are the most commonly adopted birth control method  An interview with a former North Korean resident in the early 1990s revealed that such devices are distributed free at clinics   3  Population structure and projections  Demographers determine the age structure of a given population by dividing it into five year age groups and arranging them chronologically in a pyramidlike structure that  bulges  or recedes in relation to the number of persons in a given age cohort  Many poor  developing countries have a broad base and steadily tapering higher levels  which reflects a large number of births and young children but much smaller age cohorts in later years as a result of relatively short life expectancies  North Korea does not entirely fit this pattern  data reveal a  bulge  in the lower ranges of adulthood  In 1991 life expectancy at birth was approximately 66 years for males  almost 73 for females   It is likely that annual population growth rates will increase  as well as difficulties in employing the many young men and women entering the labor force in a socialist economy already suffering from stagnant growth  Eberstadt and Banister project that the population will stabilize  that is  cease to grow  at 34 million persons in 2045 and will then experience a gradual decline  By comparison  South Korea s population is expected to stabilize at 52 6 million people in 2023   4  Settlement patterns and urbanization  North Korea s population is concentrated in the plains and lowlands  The least populated regions are the mountainous Chagang and Yanggang provinces adjacent to the Chinese border  The largest concentrations of population are in North P yŏngan and South P yŏngan provinces  in the municipal district of P yongyang  and in South Hamgyŏng Province  which includes the Hamhŭng Hŭngnam urban area  Eberstadt and Banister calculate the average population density at 167 persons per square kilometer  ranging from 1 178 persons per square kilometer in P yongyang Municipality to 44 persons per square kilometer in Yanggang Province  By contrast  South Korea had an average population density of 425 persons per square kilometer in 1989   Like South Korea  North Korea has experienced significant urban migration since the end of the Korean War  Official statistics reveal that 59 6 percent of the total population was classified as urban in 1987  This figures compares with only 17 7 percent in 1953  It is not entirely clear  however  what standards are used to define urban populations  Eberstadt and Banister suggest that although South Korean statisticians do not classify settlements of under 50 000 as urban  their North Korean counterparts include settlements as small as 20 000 in this category  And  in North Korea  people who engage in agricultural pursuits inside municipalities sometimes are not counted as urban   Urbanization in North Korea seems to have proceeded most rapidly between 1953 and 1960  when the urban population grew between 12 and 20 percent annually  Subsequently  the increase slowed to about 6 percent annually in the 1960s and between 1 and 3 percent from 1970 to 1987   In 1987 North Korea s largest cities were P yongyang  with approximately 2 3 million inhabitants  Hamhŭng  701 000  Ch ŏngjin  520 000  Namp o  370 000  Sunch ŏn  356 000  and Sinŭiju  289 000  In 1987 the total national population living in P yongyang was 11 5 percent  The government restricts and monitors migration to cities and ensures a relatively balanced distribution of population in provincial centers in relation to P yongyang   5  Vital statistics  6  Total and Percent Distribution of Population by Single Year of Age  Census 2008   7  Koreans living overseas  Large scale emigration from Korea began around 1904 and continued until the end of World War II  During the Japanese colonial occupation  1910–45   many Koreans emigrated to Northeast China  other parts of China  the Soviet Union  Hawaii  and the contiguous United States  People from Korea s northern provinces went mainly to Manchuria  China  and Siberia  many from the southern provinces went to Japan  Most émigrés left for economic reasons because employment opportunities were scarce  many Korean farmers had lost their land after the Japanese colonial government introduced a system of private land tenure  imposed higher land taxes  and promoted the growth of an absentee landlord class charging exorbitant rents   In the 1980s  more than 4 million ethnic Koreans lived outside the peninsula  The largest group  about 1 7 million people  lived in China  see Koreans in China   most had assumed Chinese citizenship  Approximately 1 million Koreans  almost exclusively from South Korea  lived in North America  see Korean Americans   About 389 000 ethnic Koreans resided in the former Soviet Union  see Koryosaram and Sakhalin Koreans   One observer noted that Koreans have been so successful in running collective farms in Soviet Central Asia that being Korean is often associated by other citizens with being rich  As a result there is growing antagonism against Koreans  Smaller groups of Koreans are found in Central America and South America  85 000   the Middle East  62 000   Europe  40 000   Asia  27 000   and Africa  25 000    Many of Japan s approximately 680 000 Koreans have below average standards of living  This is partly because of discrimination by the Japanese  Many resident Koreans  loyal to North Korea  remain separate from  and often hostile to  the Japanese social mainstream  The pro North Korean Chongryon  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  known as Chosen Soren or Chosoren in Japanese  initially was more successful than the pro South Korean Mindan  Association for Korean Residents in Japan  in attracting adherents  However  the widening disparity between the political and economic conditions of the two Koreas has since made Mindan the larger and certainly the less politically controversial faction  In addition  third  and fourth generation Zainichi Chosenjin have largely given up active participation or loyalty to the Chongryon ideology  Reasons stated for this increased disassociation include widespread mainstream tolerance of Koreans by Japanese in recent years  greatly reducing the need to rely on Chongryon and the increasing unpopularity of Kim Jong Il even among loyal members of Chongryon   Between 1959 and 1982  Chongryon encouraged the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan to North Korea  More than 93 000 Koreans left Japan  the majority  80 000 persons  in 1960 and 1961  Thereafter  the number of repatriates declined  apparently because of reports of hardships suffered by their compatriots  Approximately 6 637 Japanese wives accompanied their husbands to North Korea  of whom about 1 828 retained Japanese citizenship in the early 1990s  P yongyang had originally promised that the wives could return home every two or three years to visit their relatives  In fact  however  they are not allowed to do so  and few have had contact with their families in Japan  In normalization talks between North Korean and Japanese officials in the early 1990s  the latter urged unsuccessfully that the wives be allowed to make home visits  According to a defector  himself a former returnee  many petitioned to be returned to Japan and in response were sent to political prison camps  Japanese research puts the number of Zainichi Korean returnees condemned to prison camps at around 10 000   8
