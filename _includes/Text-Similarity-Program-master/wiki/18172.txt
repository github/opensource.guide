A land mine is an explosive device  concealed under or on the ground and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets  ranging from combatants to vehicles and tanks  as they pass over or near the device  Such devices are typically detonated automatically by way of pressure from the target stepping or driving on it  though other detonation mechanisms may be possible  The device may cause damage either by a direct blast or by fragments that are thrown by the blast   The name originates from the ancient practice of military mining  where tunnels were dug under enemy fortifications or troop formations by sappers  These killing tunnels   mines   were at first collapsed to destroy targets located above  but they were later filled with explosives and detonated in order to cause even greater devastation   Nowadays  in common parlance  land mines generally refer to devices specifically manufactured as anti personnel or anti vehicle weapons  Though many types of improvised explosive devices   IEDs   can technically be classified as land mines  the term land mine is typically reserved for manufactured devices designed to be used by recognized military services  whereas IED is used for makeshift devices assembled by paramilitary  insurgent  or terrorist groups   The use of land mines is controversial because of their potential as indiscriminate weapons  They can remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended  harming the economy and civilians of many developing nations  With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  a global movement to prohibit their use led to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and on their Destruction  Currently  a total of 161 nations are party to the Ottawa treaty   1  Use  Land mines were designed for two main uses  to create defensive tactical barriers  channeling attacking forces into predetermined fire zones or slowing an invasion force s progress to allow reinforcements to arrive  and to act as passive area denial weapons  to deny the enemy use of valuable terrain  resources or facilities when active defense of the area is not desirable or possible    Land mines are currently used in large quantities mostly for this first purpose  thus their widespread use in the demilitarized zones  DMZs  of likely flashpoints such as Cyprus  Afghanistan and Korea  As of 2013  the only governments that still laid land mines were Myanmar in its internal conflict  and Syria in its civil war   Land mines continue to kill or injure at least 4 300 people every year  even decades after the ends of the conflicts for which they were placed   2  History  2 1  Pre modern development  Jiao Yu in the preface to his Huolongjing Quanzhi  written in 1412 AD  claimed that the 3rd century Chancellor Zhuge Liang of the Kingdom of Shu  had used not only  fire weapons  but land mines in the Battle of Hulugu Valley against the forces of Sima Yi and his son Sima Zhao of the Kingdom of Wei  This claim is dubious  as gunpowder warfare did not develop in China until the advent of the flamethrower  Pen Huo Qi  in the 10th century  while the land mine was not seen in China until the late 13th century   2 2  Explosive land mines  2 2 1  East Asia  Explosive land mines were being used in 1277 AD by the Song Dynasty Chinese against an assault of the Mongols  who were besieging a city in southern China  The invention of this detonated  enormous bomb  was credited to one Lou Qianxia of the 13th century  The famous 14th century Chinese text of the Huolongjing  which was the first to describe hollow cast iron cannonball shells filled with gunpowder  was also the first to describe the invention of the land mine in greater detail than references found in texts written beforehand   This mid 14th century work compiled during the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty  before 1375  when its co editor Liu Ji died  stated that mines were made of cast iron and were spherical in shape  filled with either  magic gunpowder    poison gunpowder   or  blinding and burning gunpowder   any one of these compositions being suitable for use  The wad of the mine was made of hard wood  carrying three different fuses in case of defective connection to the touch hole   In those days  the Chinese relied upon command signals and carefully timed calculation of enemy movements into the minefield  since a long fuse had to be ignited by hand from the ambushers in a somewhat far off location lying in wait  The Huolongjing also describes land mines that were set off by enemy movement  called the  ground thunder explosive camp   one of the  self trespassing   zifan  types  as the text says   The Huolongjing describes the trigger device used for this as a  steel wheel   which directed sparks of flame onto the connection of fuses running to the multiple laid land mines underneath the carefully hidden trap  Further description of how this flint device operated was not made until a Chinese text of 1606 AD revealed that a weight drive  common in medieval clockworks  had been used to work the  steel wheel    The way in which the Chinese land mine trigger worked was a system of two steel wheels rotated by a falling weight  the chord of which was wound around their axle  and when the enemy stepped onto the disguised boards they released the pins that dropped the weights  In terms of global significance  the first wheellock musket in Europe was sketched by Leonardo da Vinci around 1500 AD  although no use of metal flint for gunpowder weapons were known before that point in Europe   Besides the use of steel wheels providing sparks for the fuses  there were other methods used as well  such as the  underground sky soaring thunder   The Ming Dynasty  1368–1644  text of the Wubei Zhi  Treatise on Armament Technology   written by Mao Yuanyi in 1628  outlined the use of land mines that were triggered by the heat of a slow burning incandescent material in an underground bowl placed directly above the train of fuses leading to the mines buried 3 ft beneath  The booby trap of this mine system had a mound where weapons of halberds  pikes  and lances were dug in  meant to entice the enemy to walk up the small mound and claim their stolen prize of war booty   When the weapons were removed from the mound  this movement disturbed the bowl beneath them where the butt ends of the staffs were  which in turn ignited the fuses  According to the Wubei Huolongjing volume of the 17th century  the formula for this slow burning incandescent material allowed it to burn continuously for 20 to 30 days without going out  This formula included of white sandal wood powder  of iron rust  ferric oxide   of  white  charcoal powder  from quicklime   of willow charcoal powder  of dried  ground  and powdered red dates  and of bran   The technology of land mine was transferred to Europe from China during 16th century   The Chinese also made use of the naval mine at sea and on the rivers of China and elsewhere in maritime battles   2 2 2  Europe and the United States  The first known land mine in Europe was created by Pedro Navarro  d  1528   a Spanish soldier  who used it in the settles of the Italian castles  in the beginning of the sixteenth century   At Augsburg in 1573  a German military engineer by the name of Samuel Zimmermann invented an extremely effective mine known as the Fladdermine  It consisted of a fougasse  or later  sometimes a shell fougasse  that is  a fougasse loaded not with stones but with early black powder mortar shells  similar to large black powder hand grenades  activated by a snaphance or flintlock mechanism connected to a tripwire on the surface  Combining the effects of a tripwire activated bounding fragmentation mine with a cluster bomb  it was devastating to massed attackers but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness  Consequently it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications  in which role it continued to be used until the 1870s   In Europe in the early eighteenth century  improvised land mines or booby traps were constructed in the form of bombs buried in shallow wells in the earth and covered with scrap metal and or gravel to serve as shrapnel  Known in French as fougasse  the term is sometimes still used in the present day to describe such devices  This technique was used in several European wars of the eighteenth century  the American Revolution  and the American Civil War   The first modern mechanically fused high explosive anti personnel land mines were created by Confederate troops of Brigadier General Gabriel J  Rains during the Battle of Yorktown in 1862  As a Captain  Rains had earlier employed explosive booby traps during the Seminole Wars in Florida in 1840  Both mechanically and electrically fused  land torpedoes  were employed  although by the end of the war mechanical fuses had been found to be generally more reliable  Many of these designs were improvised in the field  especially from explosive shells  but by the end of the war nearly 2 000 standard pattern  Rains mines  had been deployed   Improved designs of mines were created in Imperial Germany  circa 1912  and were copied and manufactured by all major participants in the First World War  Both sides employed land mines  defensively  and tunnel mines  offensively   Well before the war was over  the British were manufacturing land mines that contained poison gas instead of explosives  Poison gas mines were manufactured at least until the 1980s in the Soviet Union  The United States was known to have at least experimented with the concept in the 1950s   Nuclear mines have also been developed  both land and naval varieties  An example is the British Blue Peacock project  while another was the U S  Medium Atomic Demolition Munition   3  Characteristics and functioning  A typical land mine includes the following components   firing mechanism or other device  including anti handling devices   detonator or igniter  sets off the booster charge   booster charge  may be attached to the fuse  or the igniter  or be part of the main charge   main charge  in a container  usually forms the body of the mine   casing  contains all of the above parts   3 1  Firing mechanisms and initiating actions  A land mine can be triggered by a number of things including pressure  movement  sound  magnetism and vibration  Anti personnel mines commonly use the pressure of a person s foot as a trigger  but tripwires are also frequently employed  Most modern anti vehicle mines use a magnetic trigger to enable it to detonate even if the tires or tracks did not touch it  Advanced mines are able to sense the difference between friendly and enemy types of vehicles by way of a built in signature catalog  This will theoretically enable friendly forces to use the mined area while denying the enemy access   Many mines combine the main trigger with a touch or tilt trigger to prevent enemy engineers from defusing it  Land mine designs tend to use as little metal as possible to make searching with a metal detector more difficult  land mines made mostly of plastic have the added advantage of being very inexpensive   Some types of modern mines are designed to self destruct  or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties at the conflict s end  These self destruct mechanisms are not absolutely reliable  and most land mines laid historically are not equipped in this manner   3 2  Anti handling devices  Anti handling devices detonate the mine if someone attempts to lift  shift or disarm it  The intention is to hinder deminers by discouraging any attempts to clear minefields  There is a degree of overlap between the function of a boobytrap and an anti handling device insofar as some mines have optional fuze pockets into which standard pull or pressure release boobytrap firing devices can be screwed  Alternatively  some mines may mimic a standard design  but actually be specifically intended to kill deminers  such as the MC 3 and PMN 3 variants of the PMN mine  Anti handling devices can be found on both anti personnel mines and anti tank mines  either as an integral part of their design or as improvised add ons  For this reason  the standard render safe procedure for mines is often to destroy them on site without attempting to lift them   4  Anti tank mines  Anti tank mines were created not long after the invention of the tank in the First World War  At first improvised  purpose built designs were developed  Set off when a tank passes  they attack the tank at one of its weaker areas — the tracks  They are designed to immobilize or destroy vehicles and their occupants  In U S  military terminology destroying the vehicles is referred to as a catastrophic kill  k kill  while only disabling its movement is referred to as a mobility kill  m kill    Anti tank mines are typically larger than anti personnel mines and require more pressure to detonate  The high trigger pressure  normally requiring prevents them from being set off by infantry or smaller vehicles of lesser importance  More modern anti tank mines use shaped charges to focus and increase the armor penetration of the explosives   5  Anti personnel mines  Anti personnel mines are designed to kill or injure enemy combatants as opposed to destroying vehicles  They are often designed to injure rather than kill in order to increase the logistical support  evacuation  medical  burden on the opposing force  Some types of anti personnel mines can also damage the tracks or wheels of armored vehicles   Under the Ottawa Treaty  signatory countries undertake not to manufacture  stockpile or use anti personnel mines  As of 2009  it has been signed accessioned by 156 countries  Thirty eight countries  including the People s Republic of China  Russian Federation and the United States  are not party to the Convention   6  Warfare  In military science  minefields are considered a defensive or harassing weapon  used to slow the enemy down  to help deny certain terrain to the enemy  to focus enemy movement into kill zones  or to reduce morale by randomly attacking material and personnel  In some engagements during World War II  anti tank mines accounted for half of all vehicles disabled   Since combat engineers with mine clearing equipment can clear a path through a minefield relatively quickly  mines are usually considered effective only if covered by fire   The extents of minefields are often marked with warning signs and cloth tape  to prevent friendly troops and non combatants from entering them  Of course  sometimes terrain can be denied using dummy minefields  Most forces carefully record the location and disposition of their own minefields  because warning signs can be destroyed or removed  and minefields should eventually be cleared  Minefields may also have marked or unmarked safe routes to allow friendly movement through them   Placing minefields without marking and recording them for later removal is considered a war crime under Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons  which is itself an annex to the Geneva Conventions   Artillery and aircraft scatterable mines allow minefields to be placed in front of moving formations of enemy units  including the reinforcement of minefields or other obstacles that have been breached by enemy engineers  They can also be used to cover the retreat of forces disengaging from the enemy  or for interdiction of supporting units to isolate front line units from resupply  In most cases these minefields consist of a combination of anti tank and anti personnel mines  with the anti personnel mines making removal of the anti tank mines more difficult  Mines of this type used by the United States are designed to self destruct after a preset period of time  reducing the requirement for mine clearing to only those mines whose self destruct system did not function  Some designs of these scatterable mines require an electrical charge  capacitor or battery  to detonate  After a certain period of time  either the charge dissipates  leaving them effectively inert or the circuitry is designed such that upon reaching a low level  the device is triggered  thus destroying the mine   6 1  Guerrilla warfare  None of the conventional tactics and norms of mine warfare applies when they are employed in a guerrilla role   The mines are not used in a defensive role  for specific position or area    Mined areas are not marked   Mines are usually placed singly and not in groups covering an area   Mines are often left unattended  not covered by fire   One of the aims of terrorism – and to a certain extent of guerrilla warfare – is to spread fear and panic  This can be achieved by a single mine left on a civilian road to be detonated by a civilian target which is clearly quite different from the normal military application   One example where such tactics were employed is in the various Southern African conflicts during the 1970s and 1980s  specifically Angola  Mozambique  Namibia  South Africa and Zimbabwe   6 2  Laying mines  Minefields may be laid by several means  The preferred  but most labour intensive  way is to have engineers bury the mines  since this will make the mines practically invisible and reduce the number of mines needed to deny the enemy an area  Mines can be laid by specialized mine laying vehicles  Mine scattering shells may be fired by artillery from a distance of several tens of kilometers   Mines may be dropped from helicopters or airplanes  or ejected from cluster bombs or cruise missiles   Anti tank minefields can be scattered with anti personnel mines to make clearing them manually more time consuming  and anti personnel minefields are scattered with anti tank mines to prevent the use of armored vehicles to clear them quickly  Some anti tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry  giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti tank weapons   Some minefields are specifically booby trapped to make clearing them more dangerous  Mixed anti personnel and anti tank minefields  anti personnel mines under anti tank mines  and fuses separated from mines have all been used for this purpose  Often  single mines are backed by a secondary device  designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine   Multiple anti tank mines have been buried in stacks of two or three with the bottom mine fuzed  in order to multiply the penetrating power  Since the mines are buried  the ground directs the energy of the blast in a single direction — through the bottom of the target vehicle or on the track   Another specific use is to mine an aircraft runway immediately after it has been bombed in order to delay or discourage repair  Some cluster bombs combine these functions  One example is the British JP233 cluster bomb which includes munitions to damage  crater  the runway as well as anti personnel mines in the same cluster bomb   7  Demining  Metal detectors were first used for demining  after their invention by the Polish officer Józef Kosacki  His invention  known as the Polish mine detector  was used by the Allies alongside mechanical methods  to clear the German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein when 500 units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery s Eighth Army   The Nazis used captured civilians who were chased across minefields to detonate the explosives  According to Laurence Rees   Curt von Gottberg  the SS Obergruppenfuhrer who  during 1943  conducted another huge anti partisan action called Operation Kottbus on the eastern border of Belorussia  reported that  approximately two to three thousand local people were blown up in the clearing of the minefields     Whereas the placing and arming of mines is relatively inexpensive and simple  the process of detecting and removing them is typically expensive  slow  and dangerous  This is especially true of irregular warfare where mines were used on an ad hoc basis in unmarked areas  Anti personnel mines are most difficult to find  due to their small size and the fact that many are made almost entirely of non metallic materials specifically to escape detection   Manual clearing remains the most effective technique for clearing mine fields  although hybrid techniques involving the use of animals and robots are being developed  Animals are desirable due to their strong sense of smell  which is more than capable of detecting a land mine  Animals like rats and dogs can also differentiate between other metal objects and land mines because they can be trained to detect the explosive agent itself   Other techniques involve the use of geo location technologies  A joint team of researchers at the University of New South Wales and Ohio State University is working to develop a system based on multi sensor integration   The laying of land mines has inadvertently led to a positive development in the Falkland Islands  Mine fields laid near the sea during the Falklands War have become favorite places for penguins  which do not weigh enough to detonate the mines  Therefore  they can breed safely  free of human intrusion  These odd sanctuaries have proven so popular and lucrative for ecotourism that efforts exist to prevent removal of the mines   Norwegian NGO Norwegian People s Aid is one organisation involved in the safe removal of land mines   8  Anti personnel mine ban  The use of land mines is controversial because they are indiscriminate weapons  harming soldier and civilian alike  They remain dangerous after the conflict in which they were deployed has ended  killing and injuring civilians and rendering land impassable and unusable for decades  To make matters worse  many factions have not kept accurate records  or any at all  of the exact locations of their minefields  making removal efforts painstakingly slow  These facts pose serious difficulties in many developing nations where the presence of mines hampers resettlement  agriculture  and tourism  The International Campaign to Ban Landmines campaigned successfully to prohibit their use  culminating in the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and on their Destruction  known informally as the Ottawa Treaty   The Treaty came into force on March 1  1999  The treaty was the result of the leadership of the Government of Canada working with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  launched in 1992  The campaign and its leader  Jody Williams  won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its efforts   The treaty does not include anti tank mines  cluster bombs or claymore type mines operated in command mode and focuses specifically on anti personnel mines  because these pose the greatest long term  post conflict  risk to humans and animals since they are typically designed to be triggered by any movement or pressure of only a few kilograms  whereas anti tank mines require much more weight  or a combination of factors that would exclude humans   Existing stocks must be destroyed within four years of signing the treaty   Signatories of the Ottawa Treaty agree that they will not use  develop  manufacture  stockpile or trade in anti personnel land mines  There were originally 122 signatories in 1997    it has been signed by 155 countries and ratified by 153  Another 40 have yet to sign on  The United States is not one of the signatories  based on lacking an exception for the DMZ of Korea   There is a clause in the treaty  Article 3  which permits countries to retain land mines for use in training or development of countermeasures  64 countries have taken this option   As an alternative to an outright ban  10 countries follow regulations that are contained in a 1996 amendment of Protocol II of the Convention on Conventional Weapons  CCW   The countries are China  Finland  India  Israel  Morocco  Pakistan  South Korea  Sri Lanka  and the United States   9  Manufacturers  The ICBL has identified the following countries as manufacturing land mines as of August 2004  None are signatories of the Ottawa Treaty   Burma  Myanmar   People s Republic of China  Cuba  India  Iran  Iraq  although production had presumably ceased with the 2003 invasion   Nepal  North Korea  Pakistan  Russian Federation  Singapore  USA The United States is still manufacturing  non persistent  anti personnel and anti tank landmines   Vietnam Of other states which are thought to have manufactured mines recently   Egypt has unofficially stated that production ceased in 1988   South Korea has stated that no mines have been produced since 2000   An official from China stated in September 2003 that production has ceased there  since they have an ample stockpile   In March 2004  a Libyan official stated that the country has never produced anti personnel mines  but is known to have laid land mines in the 1970s and 1980s  More recently  during the civil war in March 2011  Gaddafi s forces had sown mines around rebel controlled areas   A United Nations assessment mission to Peru reported that production of land mines in the country ceased in January 1999  Peru was one of the original signatories and the treaty came into force for them in March 1999   Denmark had officially declared having 6 factories producing land mines in 1995 but production ceased since ratification of the Ottawa treaty   10  See also  Countermine System  Demolition belt  Mine Protected Vehicle  Unexploded ordnance  UXO   Mines  Anti handling device  ARGES
