A lysosome  derived from the Greek words lysis  meaning  to loosen   and soma   body   is a membrane bound cell organelle found in animal cells  they are absent in red blood cells   They are structurally and chemically spherical vesicles containing hydrolitic enzymes  which are capable of breaking down virtually all kinds of biomolecules  including proteins  nucleic acids  carbohydrates  lipids  and cellular debris  They are known to contain more than fifty different enzymes which are all active at an acidic environment of about pH 5  Thus they act as waste disposal system of the cell by digesting unwanted materials in the cytoplasm  both from outside of the cell and obsolete components inside the cell  For this function they are popularly referred to as  suicide bags  or  suicide sacs  of the cell  Further  lysosomes are responsible for cellular homeostasis for their involvements in secretion  plasma membrane repair  cell signalling and energy metabolism  which are related to health and diseases  Depending on their functional activity their sizes can be very different  as the biggest ones can be more than 10 times bigger than the smallest ones  They were discovered and named by Belgian biologist Christian de Duve  who eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974   Enzymes of the lysosomes are synthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum  The enzymes are released from Golgi apparatus in small vesicles which ultimately fuse with acidic vesicles called endosomes  thus becoming full lysosomes  In the process the enzymes are specifically tagged with mannose 6 phosphate to differentiate them from other enzymes  Lysosomes are interlinked with three intracellular processes namely phagocytosis  endocytosis and autophagy  Extracellular materials such as microorganisms taken up by phagocytosis  macromolecules by endocytosis  and unwanted cell organelles are fused with lysosomes in which they are broken down to their basic molecules  Thus lysosomes are the recycling units of a cell   Synthesis of lysosomal enzymes are controlled by nuclear genes  Mutations in the genes for these enzymes are responsible for more than 30 different human genetic diseases  which are collectively known as lysosomal storage diseases  These diseases are due to deficiency in a single lysosomal enzyme that prevent break down of target molecules  and consequently undegraded materials accumulate within the lysosomes often giving rise to severe clinical symptoms  Further  these genetic defects are related to several neurodegenerative disorders  cancer  cardiovascular diseases  and ageing related diseases   1  Discovery  Christian de Duve  then chairman of the Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium  had been studying the mechanism of action of a pancreatic hormone insulin in liver cells  By 1949 he and his team had focused on the enzyme called glucose 6 phosphatase  which is the first crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism and the target of insulin  They already suspected that this enzyme played a key role in regulating blood sugar levels  However  even after a series of experiments  they failed to purify and isolate the enzyme from the cellular extracts  Therefore they tried a more arduous procedure of cell fractionation  by which cellular components are separated based on their sizes using centrifugation  They succeeded in detecting the enzyme activity from the microsomal fraction  This was the crucial step in the serendipitous discovery  To estimate the enzyme activity  they used that of standardised enzyme acid phosphatase  and found that the activity was quite low  10% of the expected value   One day  the enzyme activity of purified cell fractions which had been refrigerated for five days was measured  Surprisingly the enzyme activity was increased to normal of that of the fresh sample  The result was the same no matter how many times they repeated the estimation  This led to the conclusion that a membrane like barrier limited the accessibility of the enzyme to its substrate  so that the enzymes were able to diffuse after a few days  They described the membrane like barrier as a  saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase   It became obvious that an unrelated enzyme from the cell fraction came from a membranous fractions which were definitely cell organelles  and in 1955 De Duve named them  lysosomes  to reflect their digestive properties  That same year  Alex B  Novikoff from the University of Vermont visited de Duve´s laboratory  and successfully obtained the first electron micrographs of the new organelle  Using a staining method for acid phosphatase  de Duve and Novikoff confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes using light and electron microscopic studies  de Duve won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for this discovery   2  Function and structure  Lysosomes are cellular organelles that contain acid hydrolase enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris  They can be described as the stomach of the cell  Lysosomes digest excess or worn out organelles  food particles  and engulfed viruses or bacteria  The membrane around a lysosome allows the digestive enzymes to work at the pH they require  Lysosomes fuse with autophagic vacuoles  phagosomes  and dispense their enzymes into the autophagic vacuoles  digesting their contents  They are frequently nicknamed  suicide bags  or  suicide sacs  by cell biologists due to their autolysis   The size of lysosomes varies from 0 1舑1 2 μm  At pH 4 8  the interior of the lysosomes is acidic compared to the slightly basic cytosol  pH 7 2   The lysosome maintains this pH differential by pumping in protons  H+ ions  from the cytosol across the membrane via proton pumps and chloride ion channels  Vacuolar H+ ATPases are responsible for transport of protons  while the counter transport of chloride ions is performed by ClC 7 Cl  H+ antiporter  In this way a steady acidic environment is maintained  The lysosomal membrane protects the cytosol  and therefore the rest of the cell  from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome  The cell is additionally protected from any lysosomal acid hydrolases that drain into the cytosol  as these enzymes are pH sensitive and do not function well or at all in the alkaline environment of the cytosol  This ensures that cytosolic molecules and organelles are not destroyed in case there is leakage of the hydrolytic enzymes from the lysosome   3  Formation  Many components of animal cells are recycled by transferring them inside or embedded in sections of membrane  For instance  in endocytosis  a portion of the cell’s plasma membrane pinches off to form a vesicle that will eventually fuse with an organelle within the cell  Without active replenishment  the plasma membrane would continuously decrease in size  It is thought that lysosomes participate in this dynamic membrane exchange system and are formed by a gradual maturation process from endosomes   The production of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment  Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus  mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol  where they are translated by ribosomes  The nascent peptide chains are translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum  where they are modified  Upon exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport  a specific lysosomal tag  mannose 6 phosphate  is added to the peptides  The presence of these tags allow for binding to mannose 6 phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus  a phenomenon that is crucial for proper packaging into vesicles destined for the lysosomal system   Upon leaving the Golgi apparatus  the lysosomal enzyme filled vesicle fuses with a late endosome  a relatively acidic organelle with an approximate pH of 5 5  This acidic environment causes dissociation of the lysosomal enzymes from the mannose 6 phosphate receptors  The enzymes are packed into vesicles for further transport to established lysosomes  The late endosome itself can eventually grow into a mature lysosome  as evidenced by the transport of endosomal membrane components from the lysosomes back to the endosomes   4  Disease  Lysosomes are responsible for a group of genetically inherited disorders called lysosomal storage diseases  LSD   They are a type of inborn errors of metabolism caused by malfunction of one of the enzymes  The rate of incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5 000 live births  and the true figure expected to be higher as many cases are likely to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed  The primary cause is deficiency of an acidic hydrolase  while there are conditions of defects in lysosomal membrane proteins that fail to transport the enzyme  or non enzymatic soluble lysosomal proteins  The initial effect is accumulation of specific macromolecules or monomeric compounds inside the endosomal–autophagic–lysosomal system  This results in abnormal signaling pathways  calcium homeostasis  lipid biosynthesis and degradation and intracellular trafficking  ultimately leading to pathogenetic disorders  The organs most affected are brain  viscera  bone and cartilage  There is no direct medical treatment to cure LSDs  The most common LSD is Gaucher s disease  which is due to deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase  Consequently the enzyme substrate  the fatty acid glucosylceramide accumulates  particularly in white blood cells  which in turn affects spleen  liver  kidneys  lungs  brain and bone marrow  The disease is characterized by bruises  fatigue  anaemia  low blood platelets  osteoporosis  and enlargement of the liver and spleen   5  Lysosomotropism  Weak bases with lipophilic properties accumulate in acidic intracellular compartments like lysosomes  While the plasma and lysosomal membranes are permeable for neutral and uncharged species of weak bases  the charged protonated species of weak bases do not permeate biomembranes and accumulate within lysosomes  The concentration within lysosomes may reach levels 100 to 1000 fold higher than extracellular concentrations  This phenomenon is called  lysosomotropism  or  acid trapping   The amount of accumulation of lysosomotropic compounds may be estimated using a cell based mathematical model   A significant part of the clinically approved drugs are lipophilic weak bases with lysosomotropic properties  This explains a number of pharmacological properties of these drugs  such as high tissue to blood concentration gradients or long tissue elimination half lifes  these properties have been found for drugs such as haloperidol  levomepromazine  and amantadine  However  high tissue concentrations and long elimination half lives are explained also by lipophilicity and absorption of drugs to fatty tissue structures  Important lysosomal enzymes  such as acid sphingomyelinase  may be inhibited by lysososomally accumulated drugs  Such compounds are termed FIASMAs  functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase  and include for example fluoxetine  sertraline  or amitriptyline   6  Controversy in botany  By scientific convention  the term lysosome is applied to those vesicular organelles only in animals  and vacuoles to plants  fungi and algae  Discoveries in plant cells since the 1970s started to challenge this definition  Plant vacuoles are found to be much more diverse in structure and function than previously thought  Some vacuoles contain their own hydrolytic enzymes and perform the classic lysosomal activity  which is autophagy  These vacuoles are therefore seen as fulfilling the role of the animal lysosome  Based on de Duve s description that “only when considered as part of a system involved directly or indirectly in intracellular digestion does the term lysosome describe a physiological unit”  some botanist strongly argued that these vacuoles are lysosomes  However  this is not universally accepted as the vacuoles are strictly not similar to lysosomes  such as in their specific enzymes and lack of phagocytic functions  Vacuoles do not have catabolic activity and do not undergo exocytosis as lysosomes do   7  See also  Cathelicidin  Antimicrobial peptides  Innate
