A pump is a device that moves fluids  liquids or gases   or sometimes slurries  by mechanical action  Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid  direct lift  displacement  and gravity pumps   Pumps operate by some mechanism  typically reciprocating or rotary   and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid  Pumps operate via many energy sources  including manual operation  electricity  engines  or wind power  come in many sizes  from microscopic for use in medical applications to large industrial pumps   Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells  aquarium filtering  pond filtering and aeration  in the car industry for water cooling and fuel injection  in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers  In the medical industry  pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine  and as artificial replacements for body parts  in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis   In biology  many different types of chemical and bio mechanical pumps have evolved  and biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps   1  Types  Mechanical pumps may be submerged in the fluid they are pumping or be placed external to the fluid   Pumps can be classified by their method of displacement into positive displacement pumps  impulse pumps  velocity pumps  gravity pumps  steam pumps and valveless pumps   1 1  Positive displacement pump  A positive displacement pump makes a fluid move by trapping a fixed amount and forcing  displacing  that trapped volume into the discharge pipe   Some positive displacement pumps use an expanding cavity on the suction side and a decreasing cavity on the discharge side  Liquid flows into the pump as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses  The volume is constant through each cycle of operation   1 1 1  Positive displacement pump behavior and safety  Positive displacement pumps  unlike centrifugal or roto dynamic pumps  theoretically can produce the same flow at a given speed  RPM  no matter what the discharge pressure  Thus  positive displacement pumps are constant flow machines  However  a slight increase in internal leakage as the pressure increases prevents a truly constant flow rate   A positive displacement pump must not operate against a closed valve on the discharge side of the pump  because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps  A positive displacement pump operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts  the pump is severely damaged  or both   A relief or safety valve on the discharge side of the positive displacement pump is therefore necessary  The relief valve can be internal or external  The pump manufacturer normally has the option to supply internal relief or safety valves  The internal valve is usually only used as a safety precaution  An external relief valve in the discharge line  with a return line back to the suction line or supply tank provides increased safety   1 1 2  Positive displacement types  A positive displacement pump can be further classified according to the mechanism used to move the fluid 1  Rotary type positive displacement  internal gear  screw  shuttle block  flexible vane or sliding vane  circumferential piston  flexible impeller  helical twisted roots  e g  the Wendelkolben pump  or liquid ring vacuum pumps  Reciprocating type positive displacement  piston or diaphragm pumps  Linear type positive displacement  rope pumps and chain pumps  1 1 2 1  Rotary positive displacement pumps  Positive displacement rotary pumps move fluid using a rotating mechanism that creates a vacuum that captures and draws in the liquid   Advantages  Rotary pumps are very efficient because they naturally remove air from the lines  eliminating the need to bleed the air from the lines manually   Drawbacks  The nature of the pump demands very close clearances between the rotating pump and the outer edge  making it rotate at a slow  steady speed  If rotary pumps are operated at high speeds  the fluids cause erosion  which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through  which reduces efficiency   Rotary positive displacement pumps fall into three main types   Gear pumps   a simple type of rotary pump where the liquid is pushed between two gears  Screw pumps   the shape of the internals of this pump is usually two screws turning against each other to pump the liquid  Rotary vane pumps   similar to scroll compressors  these have a cylindrical rotor encased in a similarly shaped housing  As the rotor orbits  the vanes trap fluid between the rotor and the casing  drawing the fluid through the pump   1 1 2 2  Reciprocating positive displacement pumps  Reciprocating pumps move the fluid using one or more oscillating pistons  plungers  or membranes  diaphragms   while valves restrict fluid motion to the desired direction   Pumps in this category range from simplex  with one cylinder  to in some cases quad  four  cylinders  or more  Many reciprocating type pumps are duplex  two  or triplex  three  cylinder  They can be either single acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other  or double acting with suction and discharge in both directions  The pumps can be powered manually  by air or steam  or by a belt driven by an engine  This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in the early days of steam propulsion—as boiler feed water pumps  Now reciprocating pumps typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils  and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance  Reciprocating hand pumps were widely used to pump water from wells  Common bicycle pumps and foot pumps for inflation use reciprocating action   These positive displacement pumps have an expanding cavity on the suction side and a decreasing cavity on the discharge side  Liquid flows into the pumps as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses  The volume is constant given each cycle of operation   Typical reciprocating pumps are   Plunger pumps   a reciprocating plunger pushes the fluid through one or two open valves  closed by suction on the way back   Diaphragm pumps   similar to plunger pumps  where the plunger pressurizes hydraulic oil which is used to flex a diaphragm in the pumping cylinder  Diaphragm valves are used to pump hazardous and toxic fluids   Piston pumps displacement pumps   usually simple devices for pumping small amounts of liquid or gel manually  The common hand soap dispenser is such a pump   Radial piston pumps  1 1 2 3  Various positive displacement pumps  The positive displacement principle applies in these pumps   Rotary lobe pump  Progressive cavity pump  Rotary gear pump  Piston pump  Diaphragm pump  Screw pump  Gear pump  Hydraulic pump  Rotary vane pump  Regenerative  peripheral  pump  Peristaltic pump  Rope pump  Flexible impeller  1 1 2 3 1  Gear pump  This is the simplest of rotary positive displacement pumps  It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing  The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery  The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part  because the teeth mesh closely in the centre  Gear pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various hydraulic power packs   1 1 2 3 2  Screw pump  A Screw pump is a more complicated type of rotary pump that uses two or three screws with opposing thread—e g   one screw turns clockwise and the other counterclockwise  The screws are mounted on parallel shafts that have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place  The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump  As with other forms of rotary pumps  the clearance between moving parts and the pump s casing is minimal   1 1 2 3 3  Progressing cavity pump  Widely used for pumping difficult materials  such as sewage sludge contaminated with large particles  this pump consists of a helical rotor  about ten times as long as its width  This can be visualized as a central core of diameter x with  typically  a curved spiral wound around of thickness half x  though in reality it is manufactured in single casting  This shaft fits inside a heavy duty rubber sleeve  of wall thickness also typically x  As the shaft rotates  the rotor gradually forces fluid up the rubber sleeve  Such pumps can develop very high pressure at low volumes   1 1 2 3 4  Roots type pumps  Named after the Roots brothers who invented it  this lobe pump displaces the liquid trapped between two long helical rotors  each fitted into the other when perpendicular at 90°  rotating inside a triangular shaped sealing line configuration  both at the point of suction and at the point of discharge  This design produces a continuous flow with equal volume and no vortex  It can work at low pulsation rates  and offers gentle performance that some applications require   Applications include   High capacity industrial air compressors  Roots superchargers on internal combustion engines   A brand of civil defense siren  the Federal Signal Corporation s Thunderbolt   1 1 2 3 5  Peristaltic pump  A peristaltic pump is a type of positive displacement pump  It contains fluid within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing  though linear peristaltic pumps have been made   A number of rollers  shoes  or wipers attached to a rotor compresses the flexible tube  As the rotor turns  the part of the tube under compression closes  or occludes   forcing the fluid through the tube  Additionally  when the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam it draws  restitution  fluid into the pump  This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract   1 1 2 3 6  Plunger pumps  Plunger pumps are reciprocating positive displacement pumps   These consist of a cylinder with a reciprocating plunger  The suction and discharge valves are mounted in the head of the cylinder  In the suction stroke the plunger retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder  In the forward stroke the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve  Efficiency and common problems  With only one cylinder in plunger pumps  the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions  and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions  A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system  Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem  In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other   1 1 2 3 7  Triplex style plunger pumps  Triplex plunger pumps use three plungers  which reduces the pulsation of single reciprocating plunger pumps  Adding a pulsation dampener on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple  or ripple graph of a pump transducer  The dynamic relationship of the high pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high quality plunger seals  Plunger pumps with a larger number of plungers have the benefit of increased flow  or smoother flow without a pulsation dampener  The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback   Car washes often use these triplex style plunger pumps  perhaps without pulsation dampeners   In 1968  William Bruggeman significantly reduced the size of the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints  Durable high pressure seals  low pressure seals and oil seals  hardened crankshafts  hardened connecting rods  thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps  Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world   Triplex pumps with shorter lifetimes are commonplace to the home user  A person who uses a home pressure washer for 10 hours a year may be satisfied with a pump that lasts 100 hours between rebuilds  Industrial grade or continuous duty triplex pumps on the other end of the quality spectrum may run for as much as 2 080 hours a year   The oil and gas drilling industry uses massive semi trailer transported triplex pumps called mud pumps to pump drilling mud  which cools the drill bit and carries the cuttings back to the surface  Drillers use triplex or even quintuplex pumps to inject water and solvents deep into shale in the extraction process called fracking   1 1 2 3 8  Compressed air powered double diaphragm pumps  One modern application of positive displacement diaphragm pumps is compressed air powered double diaphragm pumps  Run on compressed air these pumps are intrinsically safe by design  although all manufacturers offer ATEX certified models to comply with industry regulation  These pumps are relatively inexpensive and can perform a wide variety of duties  from pumping water out of bunds  to pumping hydrochloric acid from secure storage  dependent on how the pump is manufactured – elastomers   body construction   Lift is normally limited to roughly 6m although heads can reach almost    1 1 2 3 9  Rope pumps  Devised in China as chain pumps over 1000 years ago  these pumps can be made from very simple materials  A rope  a wheel and a PVC pipe are sufficient to make a simple rope pump  For this reason they have become extremely popular around the world since the 1980s  Rope pump efficiency has been studied by grass roots organizations and the techniques for making and running them have been continuously improved   1 1 2 3 10  Flexible impeller pump  1 2  Impulse pumps  Impulse pumps use pressure created by gas  usually air   In some impulse pumps the gas trapped in the liquid  usually water   is released and accumulated somewhere in the pump  creating a pressure that can push part of the liquid upwards   Impulse pumps include   Hydraulic ram pumps – kinetic energy of a low head water supply is stored temporarily in an air bubble hydraulic accumulator  then used to drive water to a higher head   Pulser pumps   run with natural resources  by kinetic energy only   Airlift pumps   run on air inserted into pipe  pushing up the water  when bubbles move upward  or on pressure inside pipe pushing water up   1 2 1  Hydraulic ram pumps  A hydraulic ram is a water pump powered by hydropower   It takes in water at relatively low pressure and high flow rate and outputs water at a higher hydraulic head and lower flow rate  The device uses the water hammer effect to develop pressure that lifts a portion of the input water that powers the pump to a point higher than where the water started   The hydraulic ram is sometimes used in remote areas  where there is both a source of low head hydropower  and a need for pumping water to a destination higher in elevation than the source  In this situation  the ram is often useful  since it requires no outside source of power other than the kinetic energy of flowing water   1 3  Velocity pumps  Rotodynamic pumps  or dynamic pumps  are a type of velocity pump in which kinetic energy is added to the fluid by increasing the flow velocity  This increase in energy is converted to a gain in potential energy  pressure  when the velocity is reduced prior to or as the flow exits the pump into the discharge pipe  This conversion of kinetic energy to pressure is explained by the First law of thermodynamics  or more specifically by Bernoulli s principle   Dynamic pumps can be further subdivided according to the means in which the velocity gain is achieved   These types of pumps have a number of characteristics   Continuous energy  Conversion of added energy to increase in kinetic energy  increase in velocity   Conversion of increased velocity  kinetic energy  to an increase in pressure head A practical difference between dynamic and positive displacement pumps is how they operate under closed valve conditions  Positive displacement pumps physically displace fluid  so closing a valve downstream of a positive displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump  Dynamic pumps differ in that they can be safely operated under closed valve conditions  for short periods of time    1 3 1  Radial flow pumps  These simply referred to as centripetal design pumps  The fluid enters along the axial plane  is accelerated by the impeller and exits at right angles to the shaft radially   Radial flow pumps operate at higher pressures and lower flow rates than axial and mixed flow pumps   1 3 2  Axial flow pumps  These are referred to as centrifugal design pumps  The fluid is pushed outward from the center or axis  Axial flow pumps   Centrifugal design pumps operate at much lower pressures and higher flow rates than radial flow pumps   cepumps   1 3 3  Mixed flow pumps  Mixed flow pumps function as a compromise between radial and axial flow pumps  The fluid experiences both radial acceleration and lift and exits the impeller somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees from the axial direction  As a consequence mixed flow pumps operate at higher pressures than axial flow pumps while delivering higher discharges than radial flow pumps  The exit angle of the flow dictates the pressure head discharge characteristic in relation to radial and mixed flow   1 3 4  Eductor jet pump  This uses a jet  often of steam  to create a low pressure  This low pressure sucks in fluid and propels it into a higher pressure region   1 4  Gravity pumps  Gravity pumps include the syphon and Heron s fountain  The hydraulic ram is also sometimes called a gravity pump in gravity pump the water is lift by gravitational force   1 5  Steam pumps  Steam pumps have been for a long time mainly of historical interest  They include any type of pump powered by a steam engine and also pistonless pumps such as Thomas Savery s or the Pulsometer steam pump   Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in low power solar steam pumps for use in smallholder irrigation in developing countries  Previously small steam engines have not been viable because of escalating inefficiencies as vapour engines decrease in size  However the use of modern engineering materials coupled with alternative engine configurations has meant that these types of system are now a cost effective opportunity   1 6  Valveless pumps  Valveless pumping assists in fluid transport in various biomedical and engineering systems  In a valveless pumping system  no valves  or physical occlusions  are present to regulate the flow direction  The fluid pumping efficiency of a valveless system  however  is not necessarily lower than that having valves  In fact  many fluid dynamical systems in nature and engineering more or less rely upon valveless pumping to transport the working fluids therein  For instance  blood circulation in the cardiovascular system is maintained to some extent even when the heart’s valves fail  Meanwhile  the embryonic vertebrate heart begins pumping blood long before the development of discernible chambers and valves  In microfluidics  valveless impedance pumps have been fabricated  and are expected to be particularly suitable for handling sensitive biofluids  Ink jet printers operating on the Piezoelectric transducer principal also use valveless pumping  The pump chamber is emptied through the printing jet due to reduced flow impedance in that direction and refilled by capillary action   2  Pump repairs  Examining pump repair records and mean time between failures  MTBF  is of great importance to responsible and conscientious pump users  In view of that fact  the preface to the 2006 Pump User’s Handbook alludes to  pump failure  statistics  For the sake of convenience  these failure statistics often are translated into MTBF  in this case  installed life before failure    In early 2005  Gordon Buck  John Crane Inc ’s chief engineer for Field Operations in Baton Rouge  LA  examined the repair records for a number of refinery and chemical plants to obtain meaningful reliability data for centrifugal pumps  A total of 15 operating plants having nearly 15 000 pumps were included in the survey  The smallest of these plants had about 100 pumps  several plants had over 2000  All facilities were located in the United States  In addition  considered as  new   others as  renewed  and still others as  established   Many of these plants—but not all—had an alliance arrangement with John Crane  In some cases  the alliance contract included having a John Crane Inc  technician or engineer on site to coordinate various aspects of the program   Not all plants are refineries  however  and different results occur elsewhere  In chemical plants  pumps have traditionally been  throw away  items as chemical attack limits life  Things have improved in recent years  but the somewhat restricted space available in  old  DIN and ASME standardized stuffing boxes places limits on the type of seal that fits  Unless the pump user upgrades the seal chamber  the pump only accommodates more compact and simple versions  Without this upgrading  lifetimes in chemical installations are generally around 50 to 60 percent of the refinery values   Unscheduled maintenance is often one of the most significant costs of ownership  and failures of mechanical seals and bearings are among the major causes  Keep in mind the potential value of selecting pumps that cost more initially  but last much longer between repairs  The MTBF of a better pump may be one to four years longer than that of its non upgraded counterpart  Consider that published average values of avoided pump failures range from US$2600 to US$12 000  This does not include lost opportunity costs  One pump fire occurs per 1000 failures  Having fewer pump failures means having fewer destructive pump fires   As has been noted  a typical pump failure based on actual year 2002 reports  costs US$5 000 on average  This includes costs for material  parts  labor and overhead  Extending a pump s MTBF from 12 to 18 months would save US$1 667 per year — which might be greater than the cost to upgrade the centrifugal pump s reliability   3  Applications  Pumps are used throughout society for a variety of purposes  Early applications includes the use of the windmill or watermill to pump water  Today  the pump is used for irrigation  water supply  gasoline supply  air conditioning systems  refrigeration  usually called a compressor   chemical movement  sewage movement  flood control  marine services  etc   Because of the wide variety of applications  pumps have a plethora of shapes and sizes  from very large to very small  from handling gas to handling liquid  from high pressure to low pressure  and from high volume to low volume   3 1  Priming a pump  Typically  a liquid pump can t simply draw air  The feed line of the pump must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping  An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping  This is called priming the pump  Loss of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump  The clearances and displacement ratios in pumps for liquids  whether thin or more viscous  usually cannot displace air due to its compressibility   3 2  Pumps as public water supplies  One sort of pump once common worldwide was a hand powered water pump  or  pitcher pump   It was commonly installed over community water wells in the days before piped water supplies   In parts of the British Isles  it was often called the parish pump  Though such community pumps are no longer common  people still used the expression parish pump to describe a place or forum where matters of local interest are discussed   Because water from pitcher pumps is drawn directly from the soil  it is more prone to contamination  If such water is not filtered and purified  consumption of it might lead to gastrointestinal or other water borne diseases  A notorious case is the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak  At the time it was not known how cholera was transmitted  but physician John Snow suspected contaminated water and had the handle of the public pump he suspected removed  the outbreak then subsided   Modern hand operated community pumps are considered the most sustainable low cost option for safe water supply in resource poor settings  often in rural areas in developing countries  A hand pump opens access to deeper groundwater that is often not polluted and also improves the safety of a well by protecting the water source from contaminated buckets  Pumps such as the Afridev pump are designed to be cheap to build and install  and easy to maintain with simple parts  However  scarcity of spare parts for these type of pumps in some regions of Africa has diminished their utility for these areas   3 3  Sealing multiphase pumping applications  Multiphase pumping applications  also referred to as tri phase  have grown due to increased oil drilling activity  In addition  the economics of multiphase production is attractive to upstream operations as it leads to simpler  smaller in field installations  reduced equipment costs and improved production rates  In essence  the multiphase pump can accommodate all fluid stream properties with one piece of equipment  which has a smaller footprint  Often  two smaller multiphase pumps are installed in series rather than having just one massive pump   For midstream and upstream operations  multiphase pumps can be located onshore or offshore and can be connected to single or multiple wellheads  Basically  multiphase pumps are used to transport the untreated flow stream produced from oil wells to downstream processes or gathering facilities  This means that the pump may handle a flow stream  well stream  from 100 percent gas to 100 percent liquid and every imaginable combination in between  The flow stream can also contain abrasives such as sand and dirt  Multiphase pumps are designed to operate under changing fluctuating process conditions  Multiphase pumping also helps eliminate emissions of greenhouse gases as operators strive to minimize the flaring of gas and the venting of tanks where possible   3 3 1  Types and features of multiphase pumps  Helico Axial Pumps  Centrifugal  A rotodynamic pump with one single shaft that requires two mechanical seals  this pump uses an open type axial impeller  It s often called a Poseidon pump  and can be described as a cross between an axial compressor and a centrifugal pump   Twin Screw  Positive Displacement  The twin screw pump is constructed of two inter meshing screws that move the pumped fluid  Twin screw pumps are often used when pumping conditions contain high gas volume fractions and fluctuating inlet conditions  Four mechanical seals are required to seal the two shafts   Progressive Cavity Pumps  Positive Displacement  Progressive cavity pumps are single screw types typically used in shallow wells or at the surface  This pump is mainly used on surface applications where the pumped fluid may contain a considerable amount of solids such as sand and dirt   Electric Submersible Pumps  Centrifugal  These pumps are basically multistage centrifugal pumps and are widely used in oil well applications as a method for artificial lift  These pumps are usually specified when the pumped fluid is mainly liquid   Buffer Tank A buffer tank is often installed upstream of the pump suction nozzle in case of a slug flow  The buffer tank breaks the energy of the liquid slug  smoothes any fluctuations in the incoming flow and acts as a sand trap   As the name indicates  multiphase pumps and their mechanical seals can encounter a large variation in service conditions such as changing process fluid composition  temperature variations  high and low operating pressures and exposure to abrasive erosive media  The challenge is selecting the appropriate mechanical seal arrangement and support system to ensure maximized seal life and its overall effectiveness   4  Specifications  Pumps are commonly rated by horsepower  flow rate  outlet pressure in metres  or feet  of head  inlet suction in suction feet  or metres  of head  The head can be simplified as the number of feet or metres the pump can raise or lower a column of water at atmospheric pressure   From an initial design point of view  engineers often use a quantity termed the specific speed to identify the most suitable pump type for a particular combination of flow rate and head   5  Pumping power  The power imparted into a fluid increases the energy of the fluid per unit volume  Thus the power relationship is between the conversion of the mechanical energy of the pump mechanism and the fluid elements within the pump  In general  this is governed by a series of simultaneous differential equations  known as the Navier–Stokes equations  However a more simple equation relating only the different energies in the fluid  known as Bernoulli s equation can be used  Hence the power  P  required by the pump   where Δp is the change in total pressure between the inlet and outlet  in Pa   and Q  the volume flow rate of the fluid is given in m3 s  The total pressure may have gravitational  static pressure and kinetic energy components  i e  energy is distributed between change in the fluid s gravitational potential energy  going up or down hill   change in velocity  or change in static pressure  η is the pump efficiency  and may be given by the manufacturer s information  such as in the form of a pump curve  and is typically derived from either fluid dynamics simulation  i e  solutions to the Navier–Stokes for the particular pump geometry   or by testing  The efficiency of the pump depends upon the pump s configuration and operating conditions  such as rotational speed  fluid density and viscosity etc    For a typical  pumping  configuration  the work is imparted on the fluid  and is thus positive  For the fluid imparting the work on the pump  i e  a turbine   the work is negative  Power required to drive the pump is determined by dividing the output power by the pump efficiency  Furthermore  this definition encompasses pumps with no moving parts  such as a siphon   6  Pump efficiency  Pump efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power imparted on the fluid by the pump in relation to the power supplied to drive the pump  Its value is not fixed for a given pump  efficiency is a function of the discharge and therefore also operating head  For centrifugal pumps  the efficiency tends to increase with flow rate up to a point midway through the operating range  peak efficiency  and then declines as flow rates rise further  Pump performance data such as this is usually supplied by the manufacturer before pump selection  Pump efficiencies tend to decline over time due to wear e g  increasing clearances as impellers reduce in size    When a system design includes a centrifugal pump  an important issue it its design is matching the head loss flow characteristic with the pump so that it operates at or close to the point of its maximum efficiency   Pump efficiency is an important aspect and pumps should be regularly tested  Thermodynamic pump testing is one method   7  See also  8  References  9
