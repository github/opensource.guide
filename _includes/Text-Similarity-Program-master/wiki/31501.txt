former minor league baseball player who would later work for the Burbank Park and Recreation Department  As a preteen  Burton would make short films in his backyard on Evergreen Street using crude stop motion animation techniques or shoot them on 8 mm film without sound  one of his oldest known juvenile films is The Island of Doctor Agor  that he made when he was 13 years old   Burton studied at Burbank High School  but he was not a particularly good student  He was a very introspective person  and found his pleasure in painting  drawing and watching films  His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as Dr  Seuss and Roald Dahl   After graduating from Burbank High School with Jeff Riekenberg  Burton attended the California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita  California  to study character animation  As a student in CalArts  Burton made the shorts Stalk of the Celery Monster and King and Octopus  He graduated in 1979   2  Early career  1980s  Stalk of the Celery Monster attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions  animation department  which offered Burton an animator s apprenticeship at the studio  He worked as an animator  storyboard artist and concept artist on films such as The Fox and the Hound  1981   The Black Cauldron and Tron  However  Burton s personal style clashed with Disney s standards  and he longed to work on solo projects   While at Disney in 1982  Burton made his first short  Vincent  a six minute black and white stop motion film based on a poem written by the filmmaker  and depicting a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero Vincent Price  with Price himself providing narration  The film was produced by Rick Heinrichs  whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney  The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released  alongside the teen drama Tex  for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema  This was followed by Burton s first live action production Hansel and Gretel  a Japanese themed adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale for the Disney Channel  which climaxes in a kung fu fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch  Having aired once at 10 30 pm on Halloween 1983 and promptly shelved  prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate  fueling rumors that the project did not exist  The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the Museum of Modern Art  and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at LACMA   Burton s next live action short  Frankenweenie  was released in 1984  It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car  Filmed in black and white  it stars Barret Oliver  Shelley Duvall  with whom he would work again in 1986  directing an episode of her Faerie Tale Theatre  and Daniel Stern  After Frankenweenie was completed  Disney fired Burton  under the pretext of him spending the company s resources on doing a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see   Pursuing then an opportunity to make a full length film  he was approached by Griffin Dunne to direct the black comedy film After Hours  However  after Martin Scorsese s project The Last Temptation of Christ was cancelled  though later completed and released in 1988   Scorsese showed an interest in directing After Hours  Respectfully  Burton bowed out   2 1  Pee wee s Big Adventure  Not long after  actor Paul Reubens saw Vincent and Frankenweenie and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin off of his popular character Pee wee Herman  Pee wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at The Groundlings and then the Roxy which was later turned into an HBO special  The film  Pee wee s Big Adventure  was made on a budget of $8 million and grossed more than $40 million at the box office  Burton  a fan of the eccentric musical group Oingo Boingo  asked songwriter Danny Elfman to provide the music for the film  Since then  Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed except for Ed Wood  because of a falling out that they had  and Sweeney Todd  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street because the music was based on Stephen Sondheim s musical   2 2  Beetlejuice  After directing episodes for the revitalized version of  50s  60s anthology horror series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Shelley Duvall s Faerie Tale Theatre  Burton received his next big project  Beetlejuice  1988   a supernatural comedy horror about a young couple forced to cope with life after death  and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home  Their teenage daughter Lydia  Winona Ryder  has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple  Starring Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis  and featuring Michael Keaton as the obnoxious bio exorcist Beetlejuice  the film grossed $80 million on a relatively low budget and won an Academy Award for Best Makeup  It would be converted into a cartoon of the same name  with Burton playing a role as executive producer  that ran on ABC and later Fox   2 3  Batman  Burton s ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives  and he received his first big budget film  Batman  The production was plagued with problems  Burton repeatedly clashed with the film s producers  Jon Peters and Peter Guber  but the most notable debacle involved casting  For the title role  Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as Batman following their previous collaboration in Beetlejuice  despite Keaton s average physique  inexperience with action films  and reputation as a comic actor  Although Burton won in the end  the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity  to the extent that Warner Brothers  share price slumped  Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a  bulked up  ultra masculine man as Batman  insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary  albeit fabulously wealthy  man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals  Burton cast Jack Nicholson as The Joker  Tim Curry being his second choice  in a move that helped assuage fans  fears  as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film   When the film opened in June 1989  it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time  and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time  grossing well over US$250 million in the US alone and $400 million worldwide  numbers not adjusted for inflation  and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson  as well as the film s production aspects  which won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction  The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director  and it also proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films  which eschewed the bright  all American heroism of Richard Donner s Superman for a grimmer  more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth  It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon Batman  The Animated Series  in as much as the darkness of the picture and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television   Burton claimed that The Killing Joke was a major influence on his film adaptation of Batman    I was never a giant comic book fan  but I ve always loved the image of Batman and the Joker  The reason I ve never been a comic book fan – and I think it started when I was a child – is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read  I don t know if it was dyslexia or whatever  but that s why I loved The Killing Joke  because for the first time I could tell which one to read  It s my favorite  It s the first comic I ve ever loved  And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable    3  1990s  3 1  Edward Scissorhands  In 1990  Burton co wrote  with Caroline Thompson  and directed Edward Scissorhands  re uniting with Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice  His friend Johnny Depp  a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series 21 Jump Street  was cast in the title role of Edward  who was the creation of an eccentric and old fashioned inventor  played by Vincent Price in one of his last screen appearances   Edward looked human  but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator  Set in suburbia  and shot in Lakeland  Florida   the film is largely seen as Burton s autobiography of his childhood in Burbank  Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury s book  Burton on Burton  regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film  Edward is considered one of Burton s best movies by some critics  Following this collaboration with Burton  Depp starred in Ed Wood  Sleepy Hollow  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  Corpse Bride  Sweeney Todd  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street  Alice in Wonderland  and Dark Shadows   In 2004  Matthew Bourne came to Burton with the idea to turn the story of Edward into a ballet  In 2005  the ballet first aired  It has now toured the UK  the US  Canada  Australia and parts of Europe   3 2  Batman Returns  The day Warner Brothers declined to make the more personal Scissorhands even after the success of Batman  Burton finally agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Brothers on the condition that he would be granted total control  The result was Batman Returns which featured Michael Keaton returning as the Dark Knight  and a new triad of villains  Danny DeVito  as the Penguin   Michelle Pfeiffer  as Catwoman  and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck  an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film  similar to Superman IIIs Ross Webster   Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor  concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children  Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film s overt sexuality  personified by the sleek  fetish inspired styling of Catwoman s costume  One critic remarked   too many villains spoiled the Batman   highlighting Burton s decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman  The film also polarized the fanbase  with some loving the darkness and quirkiness  while others felt it was not true to the core aspects of the source material  Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television  While in the comics  he was an ordinary man  Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed  flipper like fingers  a hooked  beak like nose  and a penguin like body  resulting in a rotund  obese man   Released in 1992  Batman Returns grossed $282 8 million worldwide  making it another financial success  though not to the extent of its predecessor   3 3  The Nightmare Before Christmas  Next  Burton wrote and produced  but did not direct  due to schedule constraints on Batman Returns  The Nightmare Before Christmas  1993  for Disney  originally meant to be a children s book in rhyme  The film was directed by Henry Selick and written by Caroline Thompson  based on Burton s original story  world and characters  The film received positive reviews for the film s stop motion animation  musical score and original storyline and was a box office success  grossing $50 million  Burton collaborated with Selick again for James and the Giant Peach  1996   which Burton co produced  The film helped to generate a renewed interest in stop motion animation   3 4  Cabin Boy  In 1994  Burton and frequent co producer Denise Di Novi produced the 1994 fantasy comedy Cabin Boy  starring comedian Chris Elliott and directed written by Adam Resnick  Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on Get a Life  but handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered Ed Wood  The film was almost entirely panned by critics  even earning Chris Elliott a 1995 Razzie Award for  Worst New Star   The film also has a 45%  rotten  rating on Rotten Tomatoes  indicating more mixed contemporary reviews   3 5  Ed Wood  His next film  Ed Wood  1994   was of a much smaller scale  depicting the life of Ed Wood  a filmmaker sometimes called  the worst director of all time   Starring Johnny Depp in the title role  the film is an homage to the low budget science fiction and horror films of Burton s childhood  and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity  Owing to creative squabbles during the making of The Nightmare Before Christmas  Danny Elfman declined to score Ed Wood  and the assignment went to Howard Shore  While a commercial failure at the time of its release  Ed Wood was well received by critics  Martin Landau received an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi  and the film received the award for Best Makeup   3 6  Batman Forever  Despite Burton s intention to still lead the Batman franchise  Warner Bros  considered Batman Returns too dark and unsafe for children  To attract the young audience  it was decided that Joel Schumacher  who had directed films like The Client  lead the third film  while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with Peter MacGregor Scott  Following this change and the changes made by the new director  Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by Val Kilmer  Filming began in late 1994 with new actors  Tommy Lee Jones  Nicole Kidman  Chris O Donnell and Jim Carrey  the only two actors who returned were Pat Hingle and Michael Gough  The film  a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher  was a huge box office success  earning $336 million  in spite of the controversy over the characters and plot  Warner Bros  demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor  Batman Returns  later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release   Schumacher was rehired to lead another sequel  the infamous Batman & Robin  in which Burton  for unknown reasons  did not participate   3 7  James and the Giant Peach  In 1996  Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy James and the Giant Peach  based on the book by Roald Dahl  The film  a combination of live action and stop motion footage  starred Richard Dreyfuss  Susan Sarandon  David Thewlis  Simon Callow and Jane Leeves among others  with Burton producing and Selick directing  The film was mostly praised by critics  and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score  by Randy Newman    3 8  Mars Attacks   Elfman and Burton reunited for Mars Attacks   1996   Based on a popular science fiction trading card series  the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all star disaster films  Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster Independence Day  which had been released five months earlier  The film boasted an all star cast  including Jack Nicholson  Glenn Close  Annette Bening  Danny DeVito  Pierce Brosnan  Michael J  Fox  Sarah Jessica Parker  Natalie Portman  Lukas Haas  Martin Short  Rod Steiger  Christina Applegate and Jack Black   3 9  Superman Lives  After Kevin Smith had been hired to write a new Superman film  he suggested Burton to direct  Burton came on and Warner Bros  set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998  the 60th anniversary of the character s debut in Action Comics  Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman  Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith s script and the film entered pre production in June 1997  For budgetary reasons  Warner Bros  ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy  delayed the film and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998  Burton then left to direct Sleepy Hollow  Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one  citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio  stating   I basically wasted a year  A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don t really want to be working with    3 10  Sleepy Hollow  Sleepy Hollow  released in late 1999  had a supernatural setting and contained another offbeat performance by Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane  now a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of Washington Irving s original tale  With Hollow  Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company Hammer Films  Christopher Lee  one of Hammer s stars  was given a cameo role  A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles  Michael Gough  Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken  among others  and Christina Ricci was cast as Katrina van Tassel  A well regarded supporting cast was headed by Miranda Richardson  Michael Gambon  Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid  Mostly well received by critics  and with a special mention to Elfman s Gothic score  the film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction  as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design  A box office success  Sleepy Hollow was also a turning point for Burton  Along with change in his personal life  separation from actress Lisa Marie   Burton changed radically in style for his next project  leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing Planet of the Apes which  as Burton had repeatedly noted  was  not a remake  of the earlier film   4  2000s  4 1  Planet of the Apes  Planet of the Apes was a commercial success  grossing $68 million in its opening weekend  The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of the novel   4 2  Big Fish

and color  Starring Ewan McGregor as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney as an older Edward Bloom  the film also stars Jessica Lange  Billy Crudup  Danny DeVito  Alison Lohman and Marion Cotillard  Big Fish is also notable as Miley Cyrus  first film—she plays  Young Ruthie  credited under her birth name  Destiny Hope Cyrus  Big Fish received four Golden Globe nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman s score  Big Fish was also the second collaboration between Burton and Helena Bonham Carter  who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch   4 3  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  2005  is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Roald Dahl  Starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka  Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs  Bucket  the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation  Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory  although some liberties were taken  such as adding Wonka s issue with his father  played by Christopher Lee   Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design  The film made over $207 million domestically  Filming proved difficult as Burton  Depp  and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton s Corpse Bride at the same time   4 4  Corpse Bride  Corpse Bride  2005  was Burton s first full length stop motion film as a director  featuring the voices of Johnny Depp as Victor and Helena Bonham Carter  for whom the project was specifically created  as Emily in the lead roles
