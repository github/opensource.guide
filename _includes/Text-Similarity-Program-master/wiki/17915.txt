Roger Federer have played each other on 27 occasions  Early in their careers  Hewitt dominated Federer  winning seven of their first nine meetings  including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland  However  from 2004 onward  Federer has dominated the rivalry  winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to emerge with an 18–9 overall head to head record  This is Hewitt s longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996  They have met in one Grand Slam final  the 2004 US Open final  where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel either side of a second set tiebreak  Federer has met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy  including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005  Their most recent meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International  where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010  when he also beat Federer to the Halle title   5 2  Hewitt vs Roddick  Hewitt s second longest rivalry was against American Andy Roddick in which the two have played on 14 occasions  Early in the rivalry Hewitt dominated the rivalry with six wins from their first seven meetings  One of those wins included a five set victory at the 2001 US Open  the tournament in which Hewitt captured his first Singles Grand Slam title  In later years Roddick began to dominate Hewitt  with the rivalry finishing at 7 wins each upon Roddick s retirement   5 3  Hewitt vs Nalbandian  A rivalry between Hewitt and Argentinian tennis players is believed to have begun at the 2002 Wimbledon final where Hewitt defeated Argentina s David Nalbandian in straight sets  The rivalry would hit boiling point in 2005 over a series of matches spread between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2005 Davis Cup Quarterfinals between Australia and Argentina  In the third round of 2005 Australian Open Hewitt faced Argentinian Juan Ignacio Chela in which Hewitt fired up Chela with his over zealous celebrations for Chela s unforced errors  causing the Argentinian to spit at Hewitt during a change of ends  Hewitt would then face David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals with Hewitt coming out victorious 10–8 in the fifth set  Later in 2005 Hewitt would face Guillermo Coria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals where their rivalry would flare up however die down the following year in the 2006 Davis Cup semifinals where Argentina came out victorious 5–0 over Hewitt and the Australians   6  Playing style  Hewitt is a defensive counterpuncher  He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent  Hewitt s lack of penetration in his groundstokes  most notably in his forehand  a typically dominant shot in most male players  forces him to rely on placement rather than simply  dominating  the point  At the 2004 Cincinnati Masters Final  commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to  ace  than Agassi because he gets more returns in play  Hewitt s tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play  consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent  and keep the ball deep until he feels he can hit a winner   Although he is known primarily as a baseliner  Hewitt is a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game  His signature shot  however  is the offensive topspin lob  a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net  US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe  Jim Courier and Tim Henman have all described Hewitt s lob as being the best in the world  although Henman has since declared Andy Murray to have succeeded him   In Andre Agassi s book  Open   Hewitt is described as one of the best shot selectors in the history of Men s Tennis   7

supporter of Australian rules football  having played the game earlier in his career and is currently the joint No 1 ticket holder for the Adelaide Crows  alongside MP and Cabinet member Kate Ellis  He once had a close friendship with Crows star Andrew McLeod  but this broke down over much public controversy in 2005  It was not long before this that Hewitt produced a DVD titled Lleyton Hewitt  The Other Side which precipitated the falling out between him and McLeod over certain filming of Aboriginal sites   Hewitt and Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters started a relationship in January 2000  during the Australian Open  The two announced their engagement just before Christmas 2003  but separated in October 2004  cancelling a planned February 2005 wedding   On 30 January 2005  shortly after losing the 2005 Australian Open final to Marat Safin  Hewitt proposed to Australian actress Bec Cartwright after they had been dating for just six weeks  They married in 2005 and have three children together   In late 2008  to extend his tennis career and reduce the amount of tax he would otherwise have had to pay  the couple relocated for the European and North American season to their future holiday home in the Old Fort Bay estate  in Nassau  Bahamas   Hewitt has a nickname   Rusty   which was given to him by Darren Cahill who at the time thought Hewitt resembled the character Rusty  from the National Lampoon film series   10  Controversies  During the 2001 U S  Open Hewitt complained to Swiss umpire Andreas Egli after being called for two foot faults by a linesman and requested that the official be moved   Look at him  Look at him and you tell me what the similarity is  Just get him off the court   The  similarity  was possibly in reference to both his opponent James Blake and the linesman being black  Hewitt told officials what he meant by the comment was that the same linesman made both foot fault calls  Tournament referee Brian Earley decided not to fine Hewitt  saying   There was no gesture in the direction of Mr  Blake when he made the comments about  the similarities   He did not use Mr  Blake s name  He didn t say  my opponent     At the French Open of the same year  Hewitt was involved in yet more controversy when he twice called match officials  spastic   Following his outbursts  a complaint was received from the Cerebral Palsy Association in Australia  Hewitt later apologised  stating  If I did say that in the heat of the battle  then I apologise  I didn t intend to offend anyone    11  Career statistics  11 1  Singles performance
