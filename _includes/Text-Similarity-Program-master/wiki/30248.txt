Theory of justification is a part of epistemology that attempts to understand the justification of propositions and beliefs  Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief  which include the ideas of justification  warrant  rationality  and probability  Of these four terms  the term that has been most widely used and discussed by the early 21st century is  warrant   Loosely speaking  justification is the reason that someone  properly  holds a belief   When a claim is in doubt  justification can be used to support the claim and reduce or remove the doubt  Justification can use empiricism  the evidence of the senses   authoritative testimony  the appeal to criteria and authority   or logical deduction   1  Subjects of justification  Many things can be justified  beliefs  actions  emotions  claims  laws  theories and so on  Epistemology focuses on beliefs  This is in part because of the influence of the definition of knowledge as  justified true belief  often associated with a theory discussed near the end of the Socratic dialogue Theaetetus  More generally  theories of justification focus on the justification of statements or propositions   2  Justifications and explanations  Justification is the reason why someone properly holds a belief  the explanation as to why the belief is a true one  or an account of how one knows what one knows  In much the same way arguments and explanations may be confused with each other  as may explanations and justifications  Statements which are justifications of some action take the form of arguments  For example attempts to justify a theft usually explain the motives  e g   to feed a starving family    It is important to be aware when an explanation is not a justification  A criminal profiler may offer an explanation of a suspect s behavior  e g   the person lost his or her job  the person got evicted  etc    and such statements may help us understand why the person committed the crime  An uncritical listener may believe the speaker is trying to gain sympathy for the person and his or her actions  but it does not follow that a person proposing an explanation has any sympathy for the views or actions being explained  This is an important distinction because we need to be able to understand and explain terrible events and behavior in attempting to discourage it   3  Justification is a normative activity  One way of explaining the theory of justification is to say that a justified belief is one that we are  within our rights  in holding  The rights in question are neither political nor moral  however  but intellectual   In some way  each of us is responsible for what we believe  Beliefs are not typically formed completely at random  and thus we have an intellectual responsibility  or obligation  to try to believe what is true and to avoid believing what is false  An intellectually responsible act is within one s intellectual rights in believing something  performing it  one is justified in one s belief   Thus  justification is a normative notion  The standard definition is that a concept is normative if it is a concept regarding or depending on the norms  or obligations and permissions  very broadly construed   involved in human conduct  It is generally accepted that the concept of justification is normative  because it is defined as a concept regarding the norms of belief   4  Theories of justification  There are several different views as to what entails justification  mostly focusing on the question  How sure do we need to be that our beliefs correspond to the actual world   Different theories of justification require different amounts and types of evidence before a belief can be considered justified  Interestingly  theories of justification generally include other aspects of epistemology  such as knowledge   The main theories of justification include   Coherentism   Beliefs are justified if they cohere with other beliefs a person holds  each belief is justified if it coheres with the overall system of beliefs   Externalism   Outside sources of knowledge can be used to justify a belief   Foundationalism   Self evident basic beliefs justify other  non basic beliefs   Foundherentism   A combination of foundationalism and coherentism  proposed by Susan Haack   Infinitism   Beliefs are justified by infinite chains of reasons   Internalism   The believer must be able to justify a belief through internal knowledge  Minority viewpoints include   Reformed epistemology   Beliefs are warranted by proper cognitive function  proposed by Alvin Plantinga   Skepticism   A variety of viewpoints questioning the possibility of knowledge   truth skepticism   Questions the possibility of true knowledge  but not of justified knowledge  epistemological skepticism   Questions the possibility of justified knowledge  but not true knowledge  Evidentialism   Beliefs depend solely on the evidence for them  5  Justifiers  If a belief is justified  there is something that justifies it  which can be called its  justifier   If a belief is justified  then it has at least one justifier  An example of a justifier would be an item of evidence  For example  if a woman is aware that her husband returned from a business trip smelling like perfume  and that his shirt has smudged lipstick on its collar  the perfume and the lipstick can be evidence for her belief that her husband is having an affair  In that case  the justifiers are the woman s awareness of the perfume and the lipstick  and the belief that is justified is her belief that her husband is having an affair   Not all justifiers have to be what can properly be called  evidence   there may be some substantially different kinds of justifiers available  Regardless  to be justified  a belief has to have a justifier   Three things that have been suggested as justifiers are   Beliefs only   Beliefs together with other conscious mental states   Beliefs  conscious mental states  and other facts about us and our environment  which one may or may not have access to   At least sometimes  the justifier of a belief is another belief  When  to return to the earlier example  the woman believes that her husband is having an affair  she bases that belief on other beliefs—namely  beliefs about the lipstick and perfume  Strictly speaking  her belief isn t based on the evidence itself—after all  what if she did not believe it  What if she thought that all of that evidence were just a hoax  What if her husband commonly wears perfume and lipstick on business trips  For that matter  what if the evidence existed  but she did not know about it  Then  of course  her belief that her husband is having an affair wouldn t be based on that evidence  because she did not know it was there at all  or  if she thought that the evidence were a hoax  then surely her belief couldn t be based on that evidence   Consider a belief P  Either P is justified or P is not justified  If P is justified  then another belief Q may be justified by P  If P is not justified  then P cannot be a justifier for any other belief  neither for Q  nor for Q s negation   For example  suppose someone might believe that there is intelligent life on Mars  and base this belief on a further belief  that there is a feature on the surface of Mars that looks like a face  and that this face could only have been made by intelligent life  So the justifying belief is  that face like feature on Mars could only have been made by intelligent life  And the justified belief is  there is intelligent life on Mars   But suppose further that the justifying belief is itself unjustified  It would in no way be one s intellectual right to suppose that this face like feature on Mars could have only been made by intelligent life  that view would be irresponsible  intellectually speaking  Thus  such a belief is unjustified because the justifier on which it depends is itself not justified   5 1  Commonly used justifiers  Abductive reasoning  Deduction  Empiricism  Induction  Occam s Razor  Pragmatism  Probability theory  Scientific method  Logical positivism  6  Criticisms  The major opposition against the theory of justification  also called ‘justificationism’ in this context  is nonjustificational criticism  a synthesis of skepticism and absolutism  which is most notably held by some of the proponents of critical rationalism  W  W  Bartley  David Miller and Karl Popper   But not all proponents of critical rationalism oppose justificationism  it is supported most prominently by John W  N  Watkins    In justificationism  criticism consists of trying to show that a claim cannot be reduced to the authority or criteria that it appeals to  That is  it regards the justification of a claim as primary  while the claim itself is secondary  By contrast  nonjustificational criticism works towards attacking claims themselves   Bartley also refers to a third position  which he calls critical rationalism in a more specific sense  claimed to have been Popper s view in his Open Society  It has given up justification  but not yet adopted nonjustificational criticism  Instead of appealing to criteria and authorities  it attempts to describe and explicate them   Fogelin claims to detect a suspicious resemblance between the Theories of Justification and Agrippa s five modes leading to the suspension of belief  He concludes that the modern proponents have made no significant progress in responding to the ancient modes of pyrrhonic skepticism   7  Notes  8  References  William W  Bartley    In Mario Bunge  Ed    The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy  The Free Press of Glencoe  1964   David Miller  A critique of good
