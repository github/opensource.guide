Johannes Kepler    December 27  1571 – November 15  1630  was a German mathematician  astronomer  and astrologer  A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution  he is best known for his laws of planetary motion  based on his works Astronomia nova  Harmonices Mundi  and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy  These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton s theory of universal gravitation   During his career  Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz  Austria  where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg  Later he became an assistant to astronomer Tycho Brahe  and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II  He was also a mathematics teacher in Linz  Austria  and an adviser to General Wallenstein  Additionally  he did fundamental work in the field of optics  invented an improved version of the refracting telescope  the Keplerian Telescope   and mentioned the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei   Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology  but there was a strong division between astronomy  a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts  and physics  a branch of natural philosophy   Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work  motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason  Kepler described his new astronomy as  celestial physics   as  an excursion into Aristotle s Metaphysics   and as  a supplement to Aristotle s On the Heavens   transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics   1  Early years  Johannes Kepler was born on December 27  the feast day of St  John the Evangelist  1571  at the Free Imperial City of Weil der Stadt  now part of the Stuttgart Region in the German state of Baden Württemberg  30 km west of Stuttgart s center   His grandfather  Sebald Kepler  had been Lord Mayor of that town but  by the time Johannes was born  he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline  His father  Heinrich Kepler  earned a precarious living as a mercenary  and he left the family when Johannes was five years old  He was believed to have died in the Eighty Years  War in the Netherlands  His mother Katharina Guldenmann  an inn keeper s daughter  was a healer and herbalist  Born prematurely  Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child  Nevertheless  he often impressed travelers at his grandfather s inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty   He was introduced to astronomy at an early age  and developed a love for it that would span his entire life  At age six  he observed the Great Comet of 1577  writing that he  was taken by  his  mother to a high place to look at it   At age nine  he observed another astronomical event  a lunar eclipse in 1580  recording that he remembered being  called outdoors  to see it and that the moon  appeared quite red   However  childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands  limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy   In 1589  after moving through grammar school  Latin school  and seminary at Maulbronn  Kepler attended Tübinger Stift at the University of Tübingen  There  he studied philosophy under Vitus Müller and theology under Jacob Heerbrand  a student of Philipp Melanchthon at Wittenberg   who also taught Michael Maestlin while he was a student  until he became Chancellor at Tübingen in 1590  He proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skillful astrologer  casting horoscopes for fellow students  Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin  Tübingen s professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631  he learned both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system of planetary motion  He became a Copernican at that time  In a student disputation  he defended heliocentrism from both a theoretical and theological perspective  maintaining that the Sun was the principal source of motive power in the universe  Despite his desire to become a minister  near the end of his studies Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz  later the University of Graz   He accepted the position in April 1594  at the age of 23   2  Graz  1594–1600   2 1  Mysterium Cosmographicum  Johannes Kepler s first major astronomical work  Mysterium Cosmographicum  The Cosmographic Mystery   was the first published defense of the Copernican system  Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19  1595  while teaching in Graz  demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac  he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios  which  he reasoned  might be the geometrical basis of the universe  After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations  even with extra planets added to the system   Kepler began experimenting with 3 dimensional polyhedra  He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be uniquely inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs  nesting these solids  each encased in a sphere  within one another would produce six layers  corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  Jupiter  and Saturn  By ordering the solids correctly—octahedron  icosahedron  dodecahedron  tetrahedron  cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding  within the accuracy limits of available astronomical observations  to the relative sizes of each planet’s path  assuming the planets circle the Sun  Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet’s orb to the length of its orbital period  from inner to outer planets  the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius  However  Kepler later rejected this formula  because it was not precise enough   As he indicated in the title  Kepler thought he had revealed God’s geometrical plan for the universe  Much of Kepler’s enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about the connection between the physical and the spiritual  the universe itself was an image of God  with the Sun corresponding to the Father  the stellar sphere to the Son  and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit  His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism   With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin  Kepler received permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript  pending removal of the Bible exegesis and the addition of a simpler  more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler’s new ideas  Mysterium was published late in 1596  and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597  it was not widely read  but it established Kepler’s reputation as a highly skilled astronomer  The effusive dedication  to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz  also provided a crucial doorway into the patronage system   Though the details would be modified in light of his later work  Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum  His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it  concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it  In 1621  Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium  half as long again as the first  detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication   In terms of the impact of Mysterium  it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in his  De Revolutionibus   Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a helio centric system in this book  he resorted to Ptolemaic devices  viz   epicycles and eccentric circles  in order to explain the change in planets  orbital speed  and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the earth s orbit rather than that of the sun  as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy   Modern astronomy owes much to  Mysterium Cosmographicum   despite flaws in its main thesis   since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it    2 2  Marriage to Barbara Müller  In December 1595  Kepler was introduced to Barbara Müller  a 23 year old widow  twice over  with a young daughter  Gemma van Dvijneveldt  and he began courting her  Müller  heiress to the estates of her late husbands  was also the daughter of a successful mill owner  Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler s nobility  though he had inherited his grandfather s nobility  Kepler s poverty made him an unacceptable match  Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium  but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication  However  church officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement  Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27  1597   In the first years of their marriage  the Keplers had two children  Heinrich and Susanna   both of whom died in infancy  In 1602  they had a daughter  Susanna   in 1604  a son  Friedrich   and in 1607  another son  Ludwig    2 3  Other research  Following the publication of Mysterium and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors  Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work  He planned four additional books  one on the stationary aspects of the universe  the Sun and the fixed stars   one on the planets and their motions  one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features  focused especially on Earth   and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth  to include atmospheric optics  meteorology  and astrology   He also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium  among them Reimarus Ursus  Nicolaus Reimers Bär —the imperial mathematician to Rudolph II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe  Ursus did not reply directly  but republished Kepler s flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over  what is now called  the Tychonic system with Tycho  Despite this black mark  Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler  starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler s system  among a host of objections  Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus  Through their letters  Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems  dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory  particularly its theological viability   But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho s observatory  Kepler had no way to address many of these issues   Instead  he turned his attention to chronology and  harmony   the numerological relationships among music  mathematics and the physical world  and their astrological consequences  By assuming the Earth to possess a soul  a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets   he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena  By 1599  however  he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data—just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz  In December of that year  Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in Prague  on January 1  1600  before he even received the invitation   Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho s patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones   3  Prague  1600–1612   3 1  Work for Tycho Brahe  On February 4  1600  Kepler met Tycho Brahe and his assistants Franz Tengnagel and Longomontanus at Benátky nad Jizerou  35 km from Prague   the site where Tycho s new observatory was being constructed  Over the next two months he stayed as a guest  analyzing some of Tycho s observations of Mars  Tycho guarded his data closely  but was impressed by Kepler s theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access  Kepler planned to test his theory from Mysterium Cosmographicum based on the Mars data  but he estimated that the work would take up to two years  since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use   With the help of Johannes Jessenius  Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho  but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6  Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements  and in June  Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family   Political and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe  in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies  Kepler sought an appointment as mathematician to Archduke Ferdinand  To that end  Kepler composed an essay—dedicated to Ferdinand—in which he proposed a force based theory of lunar motion   In Terra inest virtus  quae Lunam ciet    There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move    Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand s court  it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses  which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz  These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in Astronomiae Pars Optica   On August 2  1600  after refusing to convert to Catholicism  Kepler and his family were banished from Graz  Several months later  Kepler returned  now with the rest of his household  to Prague  Through most of 1601  he was supported directly by Tycho  who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho s  by then deceased  rival  Ursus  In September  Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor  the Rudolphine Tables that should replace the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold  Two days after Tycho s unexpected death on October 24  1601  Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work  The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life   3 2  Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II  Kepler s primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor  Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events  he had been casting well received detailed horoscopes for friends  family  and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen  In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders  the emperor sought Kepler s advice in times of political trouble  Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars  including numerous alchemists  and kept up with Kepler s work in physical astronomy as well   Officially  the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist  but Kepler s position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered  The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family  but the difficulties of the over extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle  Partly because of financial troubles  his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant  marred with bickering and bouts of sickness  Court life  however  brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars  Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels  Jost Bürgi  David Fabricius  Martin Bachazek  and Johannes Brengger  among others  and astronomical work proceeded rapidly   3 3  Astronomiae Pars Optica  As he slowly continued analyzing Tycho s Mars observations—now available to him in their entirety—and began the slow process of tabulating the Rudolphine Tables  Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600  Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena  such as unexpected shadow sizes  the red color of a total lunar eclipse  and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse  Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations  Through most of 1603  Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory  the resulting manuscript  presented to the emperor on January 1  1604  was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica  The Optical Part of Astronomy   In it  Kepler described the inverse square law governing the intensity of light  reflection by flat and curved mirrors  and principles of pinhole cameras  as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies  He also extended his study of optics to the human eye  and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye s lens onto the retina  The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics  although he did suggest that the image was later corrected  in the hollows of the brain  due to the  activity of the Soul   Today  Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics  though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent   With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry  Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work  He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci  the geometric form would morph or degenerate  one into another  In this way  an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity  and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another  a circle is formed  As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another  the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines  He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity  thus having the properties of a large circle  This idea was later utilized by Pascal  Leibniz  Monge  and Poncelet  among others  and became known as geometric continuity and as the Law or Principle of Continuity   3 4  The Supernova of 1604  In October 1604  a bright new evening star  SN 1604  appeared  but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself  Kepler began systematically observing the nova  Astrologically  the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon  the start of the ca  800 year cycle of great conjunctions  astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne  ca  800 years earlier  and the birth of Christ  ca  1600 years earlier   and thus expected events of great portent  especially regarding the emperor  It was in this context  as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor  that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova  In it  Kepler addressed the star s astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating  He noted its fading luminosity  speculated about its origin  and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars  further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens  the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging   The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens  In an appendix  Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga  he calculated that  if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind  then the Star of Bethlehem—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800 year cycle   3 5  Astronomia nova  The extended line of research that culminated in Astronomia nova  A New Astronomy —including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis  under Tycho s direction  of Mars  orbit  Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars  orbit using an equant  the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system   eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho s observations to within two arcminutes  the average measurement error   But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result  at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes  The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him  Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data   Within Kepler s religious view of the cosmos  the Sun  a symbol of God the Father  was the source of motive force in the solar system  As a physical basis  Kepler drew by analogy on William Gilbert s theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from De Magnete  1600  and on his own work on optics  Kepler supposed that the motive power  or motive species  radiated by the Sun weakens with distance  causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it  Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order  Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars  he created a formula in which a planet s rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun  Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle  however  required very extensive calculation  to simplify this task  by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry  planets sweep out equal areas in equal times—Kepler s second law of planetary motion   He then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars  using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg shaped ovoid orbit  After approximately 40 failed attempts  in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse  which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked  Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data  he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses  with the sun at one focus—Kepler s first law of planetary motion  Because he employed no calculating assistants  however  he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars  By the end of the year  he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova  though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho s observations  the property of his heirs   3 6  Dioptrice  Somnium manuscript  and other work  In the years following the completion of Astronomia Nova  most of Kepler s research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides  specific predictions of planet and star positions  based on the table  though neither would be completed for many years   He also attempted  unsuccessfully  to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini  Some of his other work dealt with chronology  especially the dating of events in the life of Jesus  and with astrology  especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin   Kepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter attacks  while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether  and Roeslin s work in particular   In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other  Kepler prepared Tertius Interveniens  Third party Interventions   Nominally this work—presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius—was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars  but it also set out Kepler s general views on the value of astrology  including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls  While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the  evil smelling dung  in which  an industrious hen  scrapes  there was an  occasional grain seed  indeed  even a pearl or a gold nugget  to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer  Conversely  Sir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology  as Kepler was  continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology  but it was the only thing for which people would pay him  and on it after a fashion he lived    In the first months of 1610  Galileo Galilei—using his powerful new telescope—discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter  Upon publishing his account as Sidereus Nuncius  Starry Messenger   Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler  in part to bolster the credibility of his observations  Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply  Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo  Conversation with the Starry Messenger   He endorsed Galileo s observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo s discoveries and telescopic methods  for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology  Later that year  Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus  providing further support of Galileo  To Kepler s disappointment  however  Galileo never published his reactions  if any  to Astronomia Nova   After hearing of Galileo s telescopic discoveries  Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne  The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as Dioptrice in 1611  In it  Kepler set out the theoretical basis of double convex converging lenses and double concave diverging lenses—and how they are combined to produce a Galilean telescope—as well as the concepts of real vs  virtual images  upright vs  inverted images  and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction  He also described an improved telescope—now known as the astronomical or Keplerian telescope—in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo s combination of convex and concave lenses   Around 1611  Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published  posthumously  as Somnium  The Dream   Part of the purpose of Somnium was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet  to show the feasibility of a non geocentric system  The manuscript  which disappeared after changing hands several times  described a fantastic trip to the moon  it was part allegory  part autobiography  and part treatise on interplanetary travel  and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction   Years later  a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother  as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel  Following her eventual acquittal  Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story—several times longer than the actual text—which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content  particularly regarding lunar geography  hidden within the text   4  Work in mathematics and physics  As a New Year s gift that year  he also composed for his friend and some time patron  Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels  a short pamphlet entitled Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula  A New Year s Gift of Hexagonal Snow   In this treatise  he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and  extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry  posed what later became known as the Kepler conjecture  a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres  Kepler was one of the pioneers of the mathematical applications of infinitesimals  see Law of Continuity   4 1  Personal and political troubles  In 1611  the growing political religious tension in Prague came to a head  Emperor Rudolph—whose health was failing—was forced to abdicate as King of Bohemia by his brother Matthias  Both sides sought Kepler s astrological advice  an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice  with little reference to the stars  except in general statements to discourage drastic action   However  it was clear that Kepler s future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim   Also in that year  Barbara Kepler contracted Hungarian spotted fever  then began having seizures  As Barbara was recovering  Kepler s three children all fell sick with smallpox  Friedrich  6  died  Following his son s death  Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua  At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg  concerns over Kepler s perceived Calvinist heresies in violation of the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return  The University of Padua—on the recommendation of the departing Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship  but Kepler  preferring to keep his family in German territory  instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz  However  Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler s return   Kepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph s death in early 1612  though between political upheaval  religious tension  and family tragedy  along with the legal dispute over his wife s estate   Kepler could do no research  Instead  he pieced together a chronology manuscript  Eclogae Chronicae  from correspondence and earlier work  Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor  Matthias re affirmed Kepler s position  and salary  as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz   5  Linz and elsewhere  1612–1630   In Linz  Kepler s primary responsibilities  beyond completing the Rudolphine Tables  were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services  In his first years there  he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples  His first publication in Linz was De vero Anno  1613   an expanded treatise on the year of Christ s birth  he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce Pope Gregory s reformed calendar to Protestant German lands  that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum  on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels  published in 1615   5 1  Second marriage  On October 30  1613  Kepler married the 24 year old Susanna Reuttinger  Following the death of his first wife Barbara  Kepler had considered 11 different matches over two years  a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem   He eventually returned to Reuttinger  the fifth match  who  he wrote   won me over with love  humble loyalty  economy of household  diligence  and the love she gave the stepchildren   The first three children of this marriage  Margareta Regina  Katharina  and Sebald  died in childhood  Three more survived into adulthood  Cordula  b  1621   Fridmar  b  1623   and Hildebert  b  1625   According to Kepler s biographers  this was a much happier marriage than his first   5 2  Epitome of Copernican Astronomy  calendars  and the witch trial of his mother  Since completing the Astronomia nova  Kepler had intended to compose an astronomy textbook  In 1615  he completed the first of three volumes of Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae  Epitome of Copernican Astronomy   the first volume  books I III  was printed in 1617  the second  book IV  in 1620  and the third  books V VII  in 1621  Despite the title  which referred simply to heliocentrism  Kepler s textbook culminated in his own ellipse based system  The Epitome became Kepler s most influential work  It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes  Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion  applied to Mars in Astronomia nova  to all the planets as well as the Moon and the Medicean satellites of Jupiter  it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data   As a spin off from the Rudolphine Tables and the related Ephemerides  Kepler published astrological calendars  which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld  In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events  the latter were often cannily accurate  thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions  By 1624  however  the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself  his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz   In 1615  Ursula Reingold  a woman in a financial dispute with Kepler s brother Christoph  claimed Kepler s mother Katharina had made her sick with an evil brew  The dispute escalated  and in 1617 Katharina was accused of witchcraft  witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time  Beginning in August 1620  she was imprisoned for fourteen months  She was released in October 1621  thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler  The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors  Katharina was subjected to territio verbalis  a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch  in a final attempt to make her confess  Throughout the trial  Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his  harmonic theory   The result  published in 1619  was Harmonices Mundi   Harmony of the World     5 3  Harmonices Mundi  Kepler was convinced  that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world   In Harmony  he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world—particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects—in terms of music  The central set of  harmonies  was the musica universalis or  music of the spheres   which had been studied by Pythagoras  Ptolemy and many others before Kepler  in fact  soon after publishing Harmonices Mundi  Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with Robert Fludd  who had recently published his own harmonic theory   Kepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids  including the figures that would come to be known as Kepler s solids  From there  he extended his harmonic analysis to music  meteorology  and astrology  harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology  the interaction between those tones and human souls  In the final portion of the work  Book V   Kepler dealt with planetary motions  especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun  Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers  but Kepler—with Tycho s data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them   Among many other harmonies  Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion  He then tried many combinations until he discovered that  approximately   The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances   Although he gives the date of this epiphany  March 8  1618   he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion  However  the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s  When conjoined with Christiaan Huygens  newly discovered law of centrifugal force  it enabled Isaac Newton  Edmund Halley  and perhaps Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them  This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies  such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated  and also by Galileo s student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics  William Gilbert  after experimenting with magnets  decided that the center of the Earth was a huge magnet  His theory led Kepler to think that a magnetic force from the Sun drove planets in their own orbits  This was an interesting explanation for planetary motion  but unfortunately for Kepler  it was wrong  Before scientists could find the right answer  they needed to know more about motion   5 4  Rudolphine Tables and his last years  In 1623  Kepler at last completed the Rudolphine Tables  which at the time was considered his major work  However  due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe s heir  it would not be printed until 1627  In the meantime  religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years  War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy  In 1625  agents of the Catholic Counter Reformation placed most of Kepler s library under seal  and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged  Kepler moved to Ulm  where he arranged for the printing of the Tables at his own expense   In 1628  following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand s armies under General Wallenstein  Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein  Though not the general s court astrologer per se  Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein s astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself  In his final years  Kepler spent much of his time traveling  from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and Ulm to a temporary home in Sagan  and finally to Regensburg  Soon after arriving in Regensburg  Kepler fell ill  He died on November 15  1630  and was buried there  his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard  Only Kepler s self authored poetic epitaph survived the times   6  Reception of his astronomy  Kepler s laws were not immediately accepted  Several major figures such as Galileo and René Descartes completely ignored Kepler s Astronomia nova  Many astronomers  including Kepler s teacher  Michael Maestlin  objected to Kepler s introduction of physics into his astronomy  Some adopted compromise positions  Ismael Boulliau accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler s area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse  while Seth Ward used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant   Several astronomers tested Kepler s theory  and its various modifications  against astronomical observations  Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory  under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed  In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631  Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury  and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date  Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted  a confirmation of Kepler s prediction  This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury  However  his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables  Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe  including Paris  Jeremiah Horrocks  who observed the 1639 Venus transit  had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model  predicted the transit  and then built apparatus to observe the transit  He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model   Epitome of Copernican Astronomy was read by astronomers throughout Europe  and following Kepler s death it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler s ideas  Between 1630 and 1650  it was the most widely used astronomy textbook  winning many converts to ellipse based astronomy  However  few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions  In the late 17th century  a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler s work—notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke—began to incorporate attractive forces  though not the quasi spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler  and the Cartesian concept of inertia  This culminated in Isaac Newton s Principia Mathematica  1687   in which Newton derived Kepler s laws of planetary motion from a force based theory of universal gravitation   7  Historical and cultural legacy  Beyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy  Kepler has loomed large in the philosophy and historiography of science  Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as Jean Etienne Montucla’s 1758 Histoire des mathématiques and Jean Baptiste Delambre s 1821 Histoire de l’astronomie moderne  These and other histories written from an Enlightenment perspective treated Kepler s metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval  but later Romantic era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success  William Whewell  in his influential History of the Inductive Sciences of 1837  found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius  in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences of 1840  Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of scientific method  Similarly  Ernst Friedrich Apelt—the first to extensively study Kepler s manuscripts  after their purchase by Catherine the Great—identified Kepler as a key to the  Revolution of the sciences   Apelt  who saw Kepler s mathematics  aesthetic sensibility  physical ideas  and theology as part of a unified system of thought  produced the first extended analysis of Kepler s life and work   Modern translations of a number of Kepler s books appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937  and is nearing completion in the early 21st century   and Max Caspar s Kepler biography was published in 1948  However  Alexandre Koyré s work on Kepler was  after Apelt  the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler s cosmology and its influence  In the 1930s and 1940s  Koyré  and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science  described the  Scientific Revolution  as the central event in the history of science  and Kepler as a  perhaps the  central figure in the revolution  Koyré placed Kepler s theorization  rather than his empirical work  at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world views  Since the 1960s  the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly  including studies of his astrology and meteorology  his geometrical methods  the role of his religious views in his work  his literary and rhetorical methods  his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time  and even his role as an historian of science   The debate over Kepler s place in the Scientific Revolution has also produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments  One of the most influential is Arthur Koestler s 1959 The Sleepwalkers  in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero  morally and theologically as well as intellectually  of the revolution  Philosophers of science—such as Charles Sanders Peirce  Norwood Russell Hanson  Stephen Toulmin  and Karl Popper—have repeatedly turned to Kepler  examples of incommensurability  analogical reasoning  falsification  and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler s work  Physicist Wolfgang Pauli even used Kepler s priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of analytical psychology on scientific investigation  A well received  if fanciful  historical novel by John Banville  Kepler  1981   explored many of the themes developed in Koestler s non fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science  Somewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction  Heavenly Intrigue  2004   suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data  Kepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time  science popularizer Carl Sagan described him as  the first astrophysicist and the last scientific astrologer    The German composer Paul Hindemith wrote an opera about Kepler entitled Die Harmonie der Welt  and a symphony of the same name was derived from music for the opera   In Austria  Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector s coin  the 10 euro Johannes Kepler silver coin  minted on September 10  2002  The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler  who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas  Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally  and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle  the motif of the obverse of the coin   In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum   In 2009  NASA named the Kepler Mission for Kepler s contributions to the field of astronomy   In New Zealand s Fiordland National Park there is also a range of mountains named after Kepler  called the Kepler Mountains  and a Three Day Walking Trail known as the Kepler Track through the mountains of the same name   7 1  Veneration  Kepler is honored together

references  The most complete biography of Kepler is Max Caspar s Kepler  Though there are a number of more recent biographies  most are based on Caspar s work with minimal original research  much of the information cited from Caspar can also be found in the books by Arthur Koestler  Kitty Ferguson  and James A  Connor  Owen Gingerich s The Eye of Heaven builds on Caspar s work to place Kepler in the broader intellectual context of early modern astronomy  Many later studies have focused on particular elements of his life and work  Kepler s mathematics  cosmological  philosophical and historical views have been extensively analyzed in books and journal articles  though his astrological work—and its relationship to his astronomy—remains understudied   11  Sources  Andersen  Hanne
