Piscis Austrinus  also known as Piscis Australis  is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere  The name is Latin for  the southern fish   in contrast with the larger constellation Pisces  which represents a pair of fishes  Prior to the 20th century  it was also known as Piscis Notius  Its only star brighter than 4th magnitude is Fomalhaut  which is a first magnitude star and is the 18th brightest star in the night sky   Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy  and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations  The stars of the modern constellation Grus once formed the  tail  of Piscis Austrinus  In 1597  or 1598   Petrus Plancius carved out a separate constellation and named it after the crane  In Greek mythology  this constellation is known as the Great Fish and it is portrayed as swallowing the water being poured out by Aquarius  the water bearer constellation  The two fish of the constellation Pisces are said to be the offspring of the Great Fish  In Egyptian mythology  this fish saved the life of the Egyptian goddess Isis  so she placed this fish and its descendants into the heavens as constellations of stars   1  Origins  Pisces Austrinus originated with the Babylonian constellation simply known as the Fish  MUL KU    2  Characteristics  Piscis Austrinus is a constellation bordered by Capricornus to the northwest  Microscopium to the southwest  Grus to the south  Sculptor to the east  Aquarius to the north  The recommended three letter abbreviation for the constellation  as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922  is  PsA   The official constellation boundaries  as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930  are defined by a polygon of four segments  In the equatorial coordinate system  the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and   while the declination coordinates are between  24 83° and  36 46°   3  Notable features  Fomalhaut traditionally represents the mouth of the fish  Its companion Fomalhaut b was thought to be the first extrasolar planet ever detected by a visible light image  thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope  but infrared observations have since retracted this claim  it is instead a spherical cloud of dust  TW Piscis Austrini can be seen close by and is possibly associated with Fomalhaut as it lies within a light year of it  Of magnitude 6 5  it is a BY Draconis variable   Beta  Delta and Zeta constitute the Tien Kang   heavenly rope   in China  Beta is a white star of apparent magnitude 4 29 and spectral type A0  and lies 130 light years away  Delta Piscis Austrini is a double star with components of magnitude 4 2 and 9 2   S Piscis Austrini is a long period Mira type variable red giant which ranges between magnitude 8 0 and 14 5 over a period of 271 7 days  and V Piscis Austrini is a semi regular variable ranging between magnitudes 8 0 and 9 0 over 148 days   Lacaille 9352 is a faint red dwarf star which is a mere 10 74 light years away  At magnitude 7 34  it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye   NGC 7172  NGC 7174 and NGC 7314 are three galaxies of magnitudes 11 9  12 5 and 10 9 respectively   4  References  Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion  2007   Stars and Planets Guide  Collins  London  ISBN 978 0 00 725120 9  Princeton University Press  Princeton  ISBN 978 0 691 13556 4   5  External links
