Telecommunications in Pakistan describes the overall environment for the growing mobile telecommunications  telephone  and Internet markets in Pakistan   In 2008 Pakistan was the world’s third fastest growing telecommunications market  Pakistan s telecom infrastructure is improving dramatically with foreign and domestic investments into fixed line and mobile networks  fiber systems are being constructed throughout the country to aid in network growth   1  Regulatory environment  The Telecommunications Ordinance of 1994 created the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority  PTA   Pakistan s first independent telecommunications regulator  and the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd  PTCL   a state owned monopoly   Due to a lack of competition  local telephone call rates were high and international call rates were even higher  During the 1990s  a call to United States cost $5 per minute  300PkRs per minute   which was not affordable for most of the population  In addition customer service was poor  fixing a problem might take 10 to 15 days  Despite this  consumers had to stick with PTCL  as they had no other options   This prompted the government to take a series of actions to improve the service by opening the telecommunications market  This was critical  but required a fine balance because opening the market and preserving PTCL were both important for the government   In July 2003 the government introduced a Deregulation Policy for the Telecommunication Sector  which allowed and encouraged foreign companies to invest in the Pakistani telecommunications market  The centerpiece of the deregulation was the establishment of two categories of basic services licenses  Local loop  LL   for fixed line telecommunication within the 14 PTCL regions  and Long distance and International  LDI   for connectivity between regions ” Two sets of criteria set by the regulatory authorities must be met before an operator is allowed to start operation  one for the issuance of a license and another for the maintenance of service quality   In 2006  Etisalat International Pakistan  a wholly owned subsidiary of Emirates Telecommunications Corporation  purchased a 26% stake in PTCL and assumed management control of the company   Pakistan s telecommunications infrastructure includes  Microwave radio relay  coaxial cable  fiber optic cable  cellular  and satellite networks  International links include  landing points for the SEA ME WE 3 and SEA ME WE 4 submarine cable systems  *AMK  that provide links to Asia  the Middle East  and Europe  3 Intelsat satellite earth stations  1 Atlantic Ocean and 2 Indian Ocean   3 operational international gateway exchanges  2 at Karachi and 1 at Islamabad   and microwave radio relay to neighboring countries   *AMK   Now IMEWE of PTCL and TWA 1 of Transworld  Private Operator  also successfully working in Karachi  Pakistan   1 1  Perception survey  LIRNEasia s Telecommunications Regulatory Environment  TRE  index summarizes stakeholders’ perception of the regulatory and policy environment and provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress  The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries  including Pakistan  The tool measured seven dimensions   i  market entry   ii  access to scarce resources   iii  interconnection   iv  tariff regulation   v  anti competitive practices   vi  universal services  and  vii  quality of service  for the fixed  mobile  and broadband sectors   The survey found that in Pakistan the mobile sector was most active  followed by broadband  while the fixed line sector remained somewhat static  The parameters that improved compared to the 2006 survey were  interconnection  tariff regulation  regulation of anti competitive practices  and universal service obligation in the mobile sector  and market entry  interconnection  regulation of anti competitive practices and universal service obligation in the fixed sector  Market entry received a low score in the mobile sector due to the perception that the cost of a new or renewal mobile license was prohibitive  thus posing a serious barrier to entry  However  this conclusion may have been incorrect  as the license fee  at least in the case of renewal by Mobilink GSM  was paid in installments over a period of three years  Thus  lack of complete information on the part of survey participants may have skewed the results   2  Mobile telecommunications  Instaphone and Paktel were the pioneers in mobile communication in Pakistan during the 1990s  They were joined by Mobilink in 1998 which was owned by Motorola until its sale to ORASCOM  The trio offered AMPS services before switching to GSM in the early 2000s  Ufone joined the mix in 2001  The sector was highly regulated which led to high call rates and poor service quality   In January 2004 the Ministry of Information Technology issued its Mobile Cellular Policy with objectives to   Promote efficient use of radio spectrum   Increase choice for customers of cellular mobile services at competitive and affordable prices   Encourage private investment in the cellular mobile sector   Recognize the rights and obligations of mobile cellular operators   Provide for fair competition among mobile and fixed line operators  and  Provide an effective and well defined regulatory regime that is consistent with international best practices  The deregulation bore fruit as international companies Telenor  Norway  and Warid Pakistan set up operations in the country in 2005   2 1  Subscriber base  The mobile telecommunications sector is seeing very large year to year growth in Pakistan  Approximately 90 percent of Pakistanis live within areas that have cell phone coverage and more than half of all Pakistanis have access to a cell phone  With 118 million mobile subscribers in March 2012  Pakistan has the highest mobile penetration rate in the South Asian region   According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority  PTA   Mobilink continues to lead the market with 35 7 million subscribers  followed by Telenor with 29 3 million  Ufone with 23 1 million  Zong with 15 6 million  and Warid Telecom with 14 3 million  All telecom companies are working to broaden their networks in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Areas  which were largely ignored until recently  Five of the seven Agencies of the tribal areas have mobile coverage   2 2  SMS  Pakistanis collectively sent over 151 billion text messages during the year 2009  Nokia has cited Pakistan to be producing the third highest SMS traffic in the world in 2010   3  Fixed line telephones  Fixed line subscriptions declined from a peak of 5 2 million in 2005 06 to 3 4 million in 2009 10   When dialing on landlines  calls made within cities are considered local calls and you just dial the local number  Calls to other cities  e g  Karachi to Lahore  are considered long distance calls  e g   when dialing to Lahore from Karachi you have to dial the code for Lahore then followed by the number of the destination  therefore you dial 042 XXXX XXXX  For international calls  you dial  00  followed by the country code  e g   for calls to the UK from Pakistan you dial 00   44   XXXXXX   The country code for Pakistan is 92   4  See also  Information technology in Pakistan  Internet in
