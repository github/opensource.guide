In mathematical analysis  a measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set  intuitively interpreted as its size  In this sense  a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length  area  and volume  A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space  which assigns the conventional length  area  and volume of Euclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the  dimensional Euclidean space   For instance  the Lebesgue measure of the interval in the real numbers is its length in the everyday sense of the word舁–舁specifically  1   Technically  a measure is a function that assigns a non negative real number or +∞ to  certain  subsets of a set  see Definition below   It must assign 0 to the empty set and be  countably  additive  the measure of a  large  subset that can be decomposed into a finite  or countable  number of  smaller  disjoint subsets  is the sum of the measures of the  smaller  subsets  In general  if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure  one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure  This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub collection of all subsets  the so called measurable subsets  which are required to form a  algebra  This means that countable unions  countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable  Non measurable sets in a Euclidean space  on which the Lebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently  are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement  Indeed  their existence is a non trivial consequence of the axiom of choice   Measure theory was developed in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Émile Borel  Henri Lebesgue  Johann Radon and Maurice Fréchet  among others  The main applications of measures are in the foundations of the Lebesgue integral  in Andrey Kolmogorov s axiomatisation of probability theory and in ergodic theory  In integration theory  specifying a measure allows one to define integrals on spaces more general than subsets of Euclidean space  moreover  the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaces is more general and has a richer theory than its predecessor  the Riemann integral  Probability theory considers measures that assign to the whole set the size 1  and considers measurable subsets to be events whose probability is given by the measure  Ergodic theory considers measures that are invariant under  or arise naturally from  a dynamical system   1  Definition  Let be a set and a  algebra over   A function from to the extended real number line is called a measure if it satisfies the following properties   Non negativity  For all in      Null empty set     Countable additivity  or  additivity   For all countable collections of pairwise disjoint sets in   One may require that at least one set has finite measure  Then the null set automatically has measure zero because of countable additivity  because   so    If only the second and third conditions of the definition of measure above are met  and takes on at most one of the values   then is called a signed measure   The pair is called a measurable space  the members of are called measurable sets  If and are two measurable spaces  then a function is called measurable if for every  measurable set   the inverse image is  measurable舁–舁i e     The composition of measurable functions is measurable  making the measurable spaces and measurable functions a category  with the measurable spaces as objects and the set of measurable functions as arrows   A triple is called a   A probability measure is a measure with total measure one舁–舁i e    A probability space is a measure space with a probability measure   For measure spaces that are also topological spaces various compatibility conditions can be placed for the measure and the topology  Most measures met in practice in analysis  and in many cases also in probability theory  are Radon measures  Radon measures have an alternative definition in terms of linear functionals on the locally convex space of continuous functions with compact support  This approach is taken by Bourbaki  2004  and a number of other sources  For more details  see the article on Radon measures   2  Examples  Some important measures are listed here   The counting measure is defined by   number of elements in    The Lebesgue measure on is a complete translation invariant measure on a σ algebra containing the intervals in such that   and every other measure with these properties extends Lebesgue measure   Circular angle measure is invariant under rotation  and hyperbolic angle measure is invariant under squeeze mapping   The Haar measure for a locally compact topological group is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure  and also of counting measure and circular angle measure  and has similar uniqueness properties   The Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure to sets with non integer dimension  in particular  fractal sets   Every probability space gives rise to a measure which takes the value 1 on the whole space  and therefore takes all its values in the unit interval  0  1    Such a measure is called a probability measure  See probability axioms   The Dirac measure δa  cf  Dirac delta function  is given by δa S    χS a   where χS is the characteristic function of   The measure of a set is 1 if it contains the point and 0 otherwise  Other  named  measures used in various theories include  Borel measure  Jordan measure  ergodic measure  Euler measure  Gaussian measure  Baire measure  Radon measure  Young measure  and strong measure zero   In physics an example of a measure is spatial distribution of mass  see e g   gravity potential   or another non negative extensive property  conserved  see conservation law for a list of these  or not  Negative values lead to signed measures  see  generalizations  below   Liouville measure  known also as the natural volume form on a symplectic manifold  is useful in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics   Gibbs measure is widely used in statistical mechanics  often under the name canonical ensemble   3  Properties  Several further properties can be derived from the definition of a countably additive measure   3 1  Monotonicity  A measure is monotonic  If and are measurable sets with then  3 2  Measures of infinite unions of measurable sets  A measure is countably subadditive  For any countable sequence of sets in  not necessarily disjoint    A measure μ is continuous from below  If are measurable sets and is a subset of for all   then the union of the sets is measurable  and  3 3  Measures of infinite intersections of measurable sets  A measure is continuous from above  If   are measurable sets and for all   then the intersection of the sets is measurable  furthermore  if at least one of the has finite measure  then  This property is false without the assumption that at least one of the has finite measure  For instance  for each   let   which all have infinite Lebesgue measure  but the intersection is empty   4  Sigma finite measures  A measure space is called finite if is a finite real number  rather than ∞   Nonzero finite measures are analogous to probability measures in the sense that any finite measure is proportional to the probability measure   A measure is called σ finite if can be decomposed into a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure  Analogously  a set in a measure space is said to have a σ finite measure if it is a countable union of sets with finite measure   For example  the real numbers with the standard Lebesgue measure are σ finite but not finite  Consider the closed intervals for all integers   there are countably many such intervals  each has measure 1  and their union is the entire real line  Alternatively  consider the real numbers with the counting measure  which assigns to each finite set of reals the number of points in the set  This measure space is not σ finite  because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many points  and it would take uncountably many such sets to cover the entire real line  The σ finite measure spaces have some very convenient properties  σ finiteness can be compared in this respect to the Lindelöf property of topological spaces  They can be also thought of as a vague generalization of the idea that a measure space may have  uncountable measure    5  Completeness  A measurable set is called a null set if   A subset of a null set is called a negligible set  A negligible set need not be measurable  but every measurable negligible set is automatically a null set  A measure is called complete if every negligible set is measurable   A measure can be extended to a complete one by considering the σ algebra of subsets which differ by a negligible set from a measurable set   that is  such that the symmetric difference of and is contained in a null set  One defines to equal    6  Additivity  Measures are required to be countably additive  However  the condition can be strengthened as follows  For any set and any set of nonnegative   define   That is  we define the sum of the to be the supremum of all the sums of finitely many of them   A measure on is  additive if for any and any family   the following hold   Note that the second condition is equivalent to the statement that the ideal of null sets is  complete   7  Non measurable sets  If the axiom of choice is assumed to be true  not all subsets of Euclidean space are Lebesgue measurable  examples of such sets include the Vitali set  and the non measurable sets postulated by the Hausdorff paradox and the Banach–Tarski paradox   8  Generalizations  For certain purposes  it is useful to have a  measure  whose values are not restricted to the non negative reals or infinity  For instance  a countably additive set function with values in the  signed  real numbers is called a signed measure  while such a function with values in the complex numbers is called a complex measure  Measures that take values in Banach spaces have been studied extensively  A measure that takes values in the set of self adjoint projections on a Hilbert space is called a projection valued measure  these are used in functional analysis for the spectral theorem  When it is necessary to distinguish the usual measures which take non negative values from generalizations  the term positive measure is used  Positive measures are closed under conical combination but not general linear combination  while signed measures are the linear closure of positive measures   Another generalization is the finitely additive measure  which are sometimes called contents  This is the same as a measure except that instead of requiring countable additivity we require only finite additivity  Historically  this definition was used first  It turns out that in general  finitely additive measures are connected with notions such as Banach limits  the dual of L∞ and the Stone–Čech compactification  All these are linked in one way or another to the axiom of choice   A charge is a generalization in both directions  it is a finitely additive  signed measure   9  See also  Abelian von Neumann algebra  Almost everywhere  Carathéodory s extension theorem  Fubini s theorem  Fatou s lemma  Fuzzy measure theory  Geometric
