Lake Erie      is the fourth largest lake  by surface area  of the five Great Lakes in North America  and the tenth largest globally or twelfth largest globally if measured in terms of surface area  It is the southernmost  shallowest  and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time  Lake Erie s northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario  with US states of Ohio  Pennsylvania and New York on its the southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west  The lake was named by the Erie tribe of Native Americans who lived along its southern shore  That Iroquoian tribe called it  Erige    cat   because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature  It is a matter of conjecture whether the Lake was named after the tribe  or if the tribe was called  Erie  because of its proximity to the Lake   The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River  which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U S  as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston  New York and Queenston  Ontario  Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne  Ontario on Lake Erie  to St  Catharines on Lake Ontario  an elevation difference of   Lake Erie s environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades  with issues such as overfishing  pollution and algal blooms and eutrophication generating headlines   1  Geography  1 1  Geographic features  Lake Erie  42 2° N  81 2W  has a mean elevation of 571 feet  174 m  above sea level  It has a surface area of with a length of and breadth of at its widest points   It is the shallowest of the Great Lakes with an average depth of 10 fathoms 3 feet  62 ft  19 m  and a maximum depth of For comparison  Lake Superior has an average depth of 80 fathoms 3 feet  483 ft  147 m   a volume of 2 900 cubic miles  12 100 km3  and shoreline of 2 726 statute miles  4 385 km   Because it is the shallowest  it is also the warmest of the Great Lakes  and in 1999 this almost became a problem for two nuclear power plants which require cool lake water to keep their reactors cool  The warm summer of 1999 caused lake temperatures to come close to the 85 °F  29 °C  limit necessary to keep the plants cool  Also because of its shallowness  and in spite of being the warmest lake in the summer  it is also the first to freeze in the winter  The shallowest section of Lake Erie is the western basin where depths average only   as a result   the slightest breeze can kick up lively waves   according to a New York Times reporter in 2004  The  waves build very quickly   according to other accounts  Sometimes fierce waves springing up unexpectedly have led to dramatic rescues  in one instance  a Cleveland resident trying to measure the dock near his house became trapped but was rescued by a fire department diver from Avon Lake  Ohio   This area is also known as the  thunderstorm capital of Canada  with  breathtaking  lightning displays  Lake Erie is primarily fed by the Detroit River  from Lake Huron and Lake St  Clair  and drains via the Niagara River and Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario  Navigation downstream is provided by the Welland Canal  part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway  Other major contributors to Lake Erie include the Grand River  the Huron River  the Maumee River  the Sandusky River  the Buffalo River  and the Cuyahoga River  The drainage basin covers 30 140 square miles  78 000 km2    Point Pelee National Park  the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland  is located on a peninsula extending into the lake  Several islands are found in the western end of the lake  these belong to Ohio except for Pelee Island and eight neighboring islands  which are part of Ontario   Major cities along the Lake Erie include Buffalo  Erie  Pennsylvania  Toledo  Ohio  Port Stanley  Ontario  Monroe  Michigan  Sandusky  Ohio  and Cleveland  Ohio   1 2  Islands  Islands tend to be located in the western side of the lake and total 31 in number  13 in Canada  18 in the U S    The island village of Put in Bay on South Bass Island attracts young crowds who sometimes wear  red bucket hats  and are prone to  break off cartwheels in the park  and general merriment  Kelleys Island was depicted by the Chicago Tribune as having charms that were  more subtle  than Put in Bay  and offers amenities such as beach lounging  hiking  biking  and  marveling at deep glacial grooves left in limestone   Pelee Island is the largest of Erie s islands  accessible by ferry from Leamington  Ontario and Sandusky  Ohio  The island has a  fragile and unique ecosystem  with plants rarely found in Canada  such as wild hyacinth  yellow horse gentian  Triosteum angustifolium   and prickly pear cactus  as well as two endangered snakes  the blue racer and the Lake Erie water snake  Songbirds migrate to Pelee in spring  and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall   1 3  Water levels  Lake Erie has a lake retention time of 2 6 years  the shortest of all the Great Lakes  This follows behind the other four  This means that the lake water is renewed from upstream sources every three years  The lake s surface area is   Lake Erie s water level fluctuates with the seasons as in the other Great Lakes  Generally  the lowest levels are in January and February  and the highest in June or July  although there have been exceptions  The average yearly level varies depending on long term precipitation  Short term level changes are often caused by seiches that are particularly high when southwesterly winds blow across the length of the lake during storms  These cause water to pile up at the eastern end of the lake  Storm driven seiches can cause damage onshore  During one storm in November 2003  the water level at Buffalo rose by 7 feet  2 1 m  with waves of 10–15 feet  3–4 5 m  for a rise of 22 feet  6 7 m   Meanwhile  at the western end of the lake  Toledo experienced a similar drop in water level  Lake water is used for drinking purposes   Historic High Water  The lake fluctuates from month to month with the highest lake levels in October and November  The normal high water mark is above datum  569 2 ft or 173 5 m   In the summer of 1986  Lake Erie reached its highest level at above datum  The high water records were set from 1986  April  through January 1987  Levels ranged from above Chart Datum   Historic Low Water  Lake Erie experiences its lowest levels in the winter  The normal low water mark is below datum  569 2 ft or 173 5 m   In the winter of 1934  Lake Erie reached its lowest level at below datum  Monthly low water records were set from July 1934 through June 1935  During this twelve month period water levels ranged from to the Chart Datum   2  Geology  Lake Erie was carved out by glacier ice  and in its current form is less than 4 000 years old  which is a short span in geological terms  Before this  the land on which the lake now sits went through several complex stages  A large lowland basin formed over two million years ago as a result of an eastern flowing river that existed well before the Pleistocene ice ages  This ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major glacier in the area  while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas  allowing water to settle and form a lake  The glaciers were able to carve away more land on the eastern side of the lowland because the bedrock is made of shale which is softer than the carbonate rocks of dolomite and limestone on the western side  Thus  the eastern and central basins of the modern lake are much deeper than the western basin  which averages only deep and is rich in nutrients and fish  Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes because the ice was relatively thin and lacked erosion power when it reached that far south  according to one view   As many as three glaciers advanced and retreated over the land causing temporary lakes to form in the time periods in between each of them  Because each lake had a different volume of water their shorelines rested at differing elevations  The last of these lakes to form  Lake Warren  existed between about 13 000 and 12 000 years ago  It was deeper than the current Lake Erie  so its shoreline existed about eight miles  13 km  inland from the modern one  The shorelines of these lakes left behind high ground sand ridges that cut through swamps and were used as trails for Indians and later  pioneers  These trails became primitive roads which were eventually paved  U S  Route 30 west of Delphos and U S  Route 20 west of Norwalk and east of Cleveland were formed in this manner  One can still see some of these ancient sand dunes that formed in the Oak Openings Region in Northwestern Ohio  There  the sandy dry lake bed soil was not enough to support large trees with the exception of a few species of oaks  forming a rare oak savanna   3  History  3 1  Native Americans  At the time of European contact  there were several groups of Iroquoian cultures living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake  The Erie tribe  from whom the lake takes its name  lived along the southern edge  while the Neutrals  also known as Attawandaron  lived along the northern shore  Near Port Stanley  there is an Indian village dating from the 16th century known as the Southwold Earthworks where as many as 800 Neutral Indians once lived  the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass–covered perimeter  Europeans named the tribe the Neutral Indians since these people refused to fight with other tribes  Both tribes were conquered and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors  the Iroquois Confederacy between A D  1651 and 1657  in what is referred to as part of the Beaver Wars   For decades after those wars  the land around eastern Lake Erie was claimed and utilized by the Iroquois as a hunting ground  As the power of the Iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century  several other  mainly Anishinaabe Native American tribes  displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake  There was a legend of an Indian woman named Huldah who  despairing over her lost British lover  hurled herself from a high rock from Pelee Island   3 2  European exploration and settlement  In 1669  the Frenchman Louis Jolliet was the first documented European to sight Lake Erie  although there is speculation that Étienne Brûlé may have come across it in 1615  Lake Erie was the last of the Great Lakes to be explored by Europeans  since the Iroquois who occupied the Niagara River area were in conflict with the French  and they did not allow explorers or traders to pass through  Explorers followed rivers out of Lake Ontario and portaged directly into Lake Huron  British authorities in Canada were nervous about possible expansion by American settlers across Lake Erie  so Colonel Talbot developed the Talbot Trail in 1809 as a way to stimulate settlement to the area  Talbot recruited settlers from Ireland and Scotland and there are numerous places named after him  such as Port Talbot and the Talbot River and Talbotville in southern Ontario   During the War of 1812  Oliver Hazard Perry captured an entire British fleet in 1813 near Put in Bay  Ohio  despite having inferior numbers  American soldiers swept through the Ontario area around Port Rowan burning towns and villages  but spared a gristmill owned by a Canadian mason named John Backhouse  according to one report  Generally  however  despite the two exceptions being the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 which involved conflicts between the U S  and Great Britain  relations between the U S  and Canada have been remarkably friendly with an  unfortified boundary  and an agreement  that has kept all fleets of war off the Great Lakes    In 1837  rebellions broke about between Canadian settlers and the British Colonial government  primarily over political reforms and land allocation issues  Some of the rebels stationed themselves in the U S  and crossed the ice from Sandusky Bay to Pelee Island wearing  tattered overcoats and worn out boots   and carrying muskets  pitchforks  and swords  but the islanders had already fled  Later  there was a battle on the ice with the Royal 32nd regiment  with the rebels being driven to retreat   Settlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s  An important business was fishing  In the pre Civil War years  railways sprouted everywhere  and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake  Maritime traffic picked up  although the lake was usually closed because of ice from December to early April  and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding  Since slavery had been abolished in Canada in 1833  but was still legal in southern states of the U S   a Lake Erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom   Merchant shippers lacked modern radar and weather forecasting  so vessels were often caught up in intense gales   There were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters  in 1868  the captain of the Grace Whitney saw a sunken vessel  three men clinging to the masthead  but he could not help because of the gale and high seas   A balloonist named John Steiner of Philadelphia made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857  He was described in the New York Times as an eronaut or aeronaut  powered boats were called propellers  and fast was deemed railroad speed  Here s an account of the day long voyage over the lake   In 1885  lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially  sometimes by as much as two feet  so that at ports such as Toledo  watercraft could not load coal or depart the port   During the history of the lake as a fishery  there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups  Here s an 1895 newspaper account in which critics of commercial fishing issued dire predictions and calling for government action to solve the problem   Predictions of the lake being over fished in 1895 were premature  since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing  pollution in the middle of the 20th century  invasive species and other ailments  but state and provincial governments  as well as national governments  have played a greater role as time went by  Business boomed  in 1901  the Carnegie Company proposed building a new harbor near Erie in Elk Creek to accommodate shipments from its tube plant site nearby  In 1913  a memorial to Commodore Perry was built on Put in Bay island featuring a Doric column   During the Prohibition years from 1919 to 1933  a  great deal of alcohol crossed Erie  along with  mobster corpses  dumped into the Detroit River which sometimes washed up on the beaches of Pelee Island  According to one account  Al Capone hid a  fortune  in the walls of the Middle Island luxury club  but no money was found in it as of 2007 when the building no longer stood  The club had a basement casino with poker tables and slot machines   During the 20th century  commercial fishing was prevalent  but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake  and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake  Sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old mains broke  raw sewage would spill directly into the Cuyahoga and into the lake  A report in Time Magazine in 1969 described the lake as a  gigantic cesspool  since only 3 of 62 beaches were rated  completely safe for swimming    By 1975 the popular commercial fish blue pike had been declared extinct  although the declaration may have been premature  By the 1980s  there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3 000 workers  but commercial fishing was declining rapidly  particularly from the American side   3 3  Great Lakes Compact  In 2005  the Great Lakes States of Ohio  Michigan  New York  Pennsylvania  Illinois  Indiana  Wisconsin  Minnesota and the Canadian Province of Ontario endorsed the Great Lakes St  Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Compact  Compact   The Compact was signed into law by President George W  Bush in September 2008  An international water rights policy overseen by the Great Lakes Commission  the Compact aims to prevent diversion of water from Great Lakes to distant states  as well as to set standards for use and conservation  It had support from both political parties  including former United States Senator George Voinovich  R OH  and former Governor Jennifer Granholm  D MI   but is not popular in the southwestern states due to frequent drought conditions and water scarcity   4  Lake environment  4 1  Weather  4 1 1  Lake Erie in winter  Like the other Great Lakes  Erie produces lake effect snow when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters  When the difference in temperature between the relatively warm surface water and the colder air reaches a threshold value of 18 to 23 degrees Fahrenheit  10 to 13 degrees Celsius   then  lake effect snow becomes possible    Heavy lake effect snowfalls can occur when cold air travels or longer over a large unfrozen lake  Lake effect snow makes Buffalo and Erie the eleventh and thirteenth snowiest places in the entire United States respectively  according to data collected from the National Climatic Data Center  Since winds blow primarily west–to–east along the main axis of the lake  lake effect snow effects are more pronounced on the eastern parts of the lake such as cities such as Buffalo and Erie  Buffalo typically gets of snow each winter  and sometimes ten feet  3 m  of snow  the snowiest city is Syracuse  New York  which gets lake effect precipitation from Lake Ontario as well as Lake Erie  A storm around Christmas in 2001 pounded Buffalo with seven feet of snow   The lake effect ends or its effect is reduced  however  when the lake freezes over  In January 2011  for example  residents of Cleveland were glad when Lake Erie was  90 percent frozen  since it meant that the area had  made it over the hump  in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling  Being the shallowest of the Great Lakes  it is the most likely to freeze and frequently does  On February 16  2010  meteorologists reported that the lake had frozen over marking the first time the lake had completely frozen over since the winter of 1995–1996  In contrast  Lake Michigan has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south  although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century  When the lake freezes over  this usually shuts down the lake effect snowfall  In past years  lake ice was so thick that it was possible to drive over it or go sailing on iceboats  but in the first decade of the 21st century  the ice has not been thick enough for such activities  Many lake residents take advantage of the ice and travel  some drive to Canada and back  Here s one account of ice life around Put in Bay   4 1 2  Windy conditions  Strong winds have caused lake currents to shift sediment on the bottom  leading to  wickedly shifting sandbars  which have been a source of shipwrecks  But winds can have a peaceful purpose as well  there have been proposals to place electricity–producing wind turbines in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast  both in the United States and Canada  In 2010  there were plans for GE to develop five wind turbines to generate 20 megawatts of power by 2012 with plans to generate 1 000 megawatts by 2020  one proposal called for  gearless turbines  with 176 foot long blades helped along with magnets  A nonprofit development group near Cleveland was developing plans to construct hundreds of turbines in the lake  A former steel mill site on the eastern edge of the lake in Buffalo  NY has been redeveloped as an urban wind farm in 2007  Known as Steel Winds  the project currently houses 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity  A plan by Samsung to build an offshore wind farm on the north shore of the lake  from Port Maitland to Nanticoke for a distance of   but the plan has been met with opposition from residents for a number of reasons  Canadians near Leamington and Kingsville have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake  reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views as well as possible adverse effects regarding drinking water and commercial fishing  Plans to install turbines in Pigeon Bay  south of Leamington were met with opposition as well  The notion that bird and bat migration may be hurt by the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines  a reporter in The Globe and Mail wrote  Given the tendency of turbines to make mincemeat of things airborne  it doesn’t require great imagination to figure out what would happen    4 1 3  Microclimates  The lake is also responsible for microclimates that are important to agriculture  Along its north shore is one of the richest areas of Canada s fruit and vegetable production  this southernmost tip  particularly in the area around Leamington  is known as Canada s  tomato capital   The area around Port Rowan in Ontario has special trees which grow because of the  tempering effect of the lake   and species include tulip trees  flowering dogwood  sassafras and sour gum  In this area there are many greenhouses which produce a  variety of tropical plants rarely cultivated so far north   including some species of cacti  because of the lake s tempering effect  Along the southeastern shore in Ohio  Pennsylvania  and New York is an important grape growing region  as are the islands in the lake  Apple orchards are abundant in northeast Ohio to western New York   4 1 4  Long term weather patterns  According to one estimate  34 to 36 inches of water evaporates each year from the surface of the lake  which allows for rainfall and other precipitation in surrounding areas  There are conflicting reports about the overall effect of global warming on the Great Lakes region  including Lake Erie  One account suggests that climate change is causing greater evaporation of lake water  leading to warmer temperatures as well as ice in winter which is less thick or nonexistent  fueling concerns that  Erie appears to be shrinking  and is the most likely candidate among the five Great Lakes to  turn into a festering mud puddle   In 2010  the Windsor Star reported that the lake experienced  record breaking temperatures  reaching 81 °F  27 °C  in mid August and compared the lake to a  bath tub   But the long term weather patterns are subject to controversy   4 2  Ecosystems  Lake Erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in constant interaction  Human activity  such as pollution and maritime ship traffic  can affect this environment in numerous ways  The interactions between the new species can sometimes have beneficial effects  as well as harmful effects  Some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of Pacific salmon  Occasionally there have been mass die offs of certain species of fish  sometimes for reasons unknown  such as many numbers of rainbow smelt in May 2010   4 2 1  Invasive species  The lake has been plagued with a number of invasive species  including Zebra and quagga mussels  the goby and the grass carp  One estimate was that there have been 180 invasive species in the Great Lakes  some having traveled in ballast water in international ships  Zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in Lake Erie  In 2008 there were concerns that the  newest invader swarming in the Great Lakes   which was the  bloody red shrimp   might harm fish populations and promote algae blooms   Environmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the Franz Theodore Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island  The lab  which was established in 1895  is the oldest biological field station in the United States  Stone Laboratory was donated to the Ohio State University by Julius Stone in 1925 as part of the university s Ohio Sea Grant College Program  In addition  the Great Lakes Institute of the University of Windsor has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as phosphorus   4 2 2  Eutrophication and the infamous dead zone  An ongoing concern is that  nutrient overloading from fertilizers  human and animal waste   known as eutrophication  in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake  will cause plant life to  run wild and multiply like crazy   Since there are fewer wetlands  which are like  Nature s kidneys  by filtering nutrients  as well as greater  channelization of waterways   nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout as well as  low oxygen dead zones  in a complex interaction of natural forces  As of the 2010s much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to no till soybean and corn fields but washed into streams by heavy rains  The algal blooms result from growth of Microcystis  a toxic blue green algae that the Zebra mussels which infest the lake don t eat   There periodically is a dead zone  or region of low oxygen  in the lake whose exact location varies  Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been studying the lake s blue green algae blooms  and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might hit landfall  typically the blooms arrive late each summer  This problem was extreme in the mid and late 1960 s and the Lake Erie Wastewater Management Study  LEWMS  conducted by the Buffalo District of the US Army Corps of Engineers determined that the eutrophication was due to  point sources  such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls  as well as  diffuse sources   such as overland runoff from farm and forest land  All these sources contribute nutrients  primarily phosphorus  to the Lake  Growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted  LEWMS made recommendations for reducing point source outflows  as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage  employing  no till  farming and other conservative practices  Many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced  The improved farming practices  which were voluntary  were followed for a while  resulting in remarkable recovery of the Lake in the 1970s   Unfortunately  the conservative practices are not monitored  and have not been kept up  One recent account suggests that the seasonal algae blooms in Lake Erie were possibly caused by  runoff from cities  fertilizers  zebra mussels  and livestock near water   A second report focuses on the zebra mussels as being the cause of  big oxygen poor dead zones  since they filter so much sediment that they have resulted in the growth of algae  One report suggests the oxygen poor zone began about 1993 in the lake s central basin and becomes more pronounced during summer months  but it is somewhat of a mystery why this happens  Some scientists speculate that the dead zone is a naturally occurring phenomenon  Another report cited Ohio s Maumee River as the main source of polluted runoff of phosphorus from industries  municipalities  tributaries and agriculture  and in 2008  satellite images showed the algal bloom heading toward Pelee Island  and possibly heading to Lake Erie s central basin  There have been two year $2 million studies trying to understand the  growing zone  which was described as a  10 foot thick layer of cold water at the bottom   in one area  which stretches  100 miles across the lake s center   It kills fish and microscopic creatures of the lake s food chain and fouls the water  and may cause further problems in later years for sport and commercial fishing   Algae blooms continued in early 2013 but new farming techniques  climate change and even a change in Lake Erie’s ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable   4 2 3  Snakes  The Lake Erie water snake  a subspecies of the northern water snake  Nerodia sipedon   lives in the vicinity of Ohio s Put in Bay Harbor  and had been put on the threatened species list  A threatened species is one which may soon become an endangered species  By 2010  the water snake population was over 12 000 snakes  While they have a non venomous bite  they are a key predator in the lake s aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies and walleye and smallmouth bass  The snake was helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check  They mate from late May through early June and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched with several males   4 2 4  Asian carp  There is a concern that Asian carp might enter the Great Lakes region and alter the ecosystem negatively  They have been described as  greedy giants that suck plankton from the water with the brutal efficiency of vacuum cleaners  and scientists worry that they may unravel the  aquatic food web  by crowding out other species   4 2 5  Snakehead fish  There was concern in 2007 that Snakehead fish could get into the Great Lakes area  Officials warn that if the fish invades  it could  decimate the aquatic food chain   A YouTube video mentioned in a newspaper account has a man claiming that the fish could  bite your entire hand off   The fish can reach 5 feet 11 inches  1 8 m  in length and  survive out of water for four days  and  has a mouth full of teeth that can shear fish in half  and can  eat ducks and small mammals   It should be noted however the snakehead fish can not live in a lake that has completely frozen over  They must come to the surface to breathe via their swim bladder   4 2 6  Agriculture and life around the lake  In 1999  Doppler radar weather sensors detected millions of mayflies heading for Presque Isle in blue and green splotches on the radar in clouds measuring ten miles  16 km  long  These insects were a sign of Lake Erie s move back to health  since the mayflies require clean water to thrive  Biologist Masteller of Penn State Erie declared the bugs to be a  nice nuisance  since they signified the lake s return to health after forty years of absence  Each is an inch and a half long  the three main species of mayflies are Ephemera simulans  Hexagenia rigida and Hexagenia limbata  The insects mate over a 72 hour period from June through September  they fly in masses up to the shore  mate in the air  then females lay up to 8 000 eggs each over the water  the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats  Sometimes the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages as well as causing roads to become slippery with squashed insects  Since zebra mussels filter extra nutrients from the lake  it allows the mayfly larvae to thrive   There have been incidents of birds dying from botulism  in 2000  and in 2002  Birds affected included grebes  common and red breasted mergansers  loons  diving ducks  ring billed gulls and herring gulls  One account suggests that bird populations are in trouble  notably the woodland warbler  which had population declines around 60 percent in 2008  Possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices  loss of habitats  soil depletion and erosion  and toxic chemicals  In 2006  there were concerns of possible bird flu after two wild swans on the lake were found diseased  but it was learned that they did not contain the deadly H5N1 virus  There were sightings of a magnificent frigatebird  a tropical bird with a two metre wingspan  over the lake in 2008   4 2 7  Water quality issues and restoration  Lake Erie infamously became very polluted in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the quantity of heavy industry situated in cities on its shores  with reports of bacteria laden beaches and fish contaminated by industrial waste  In the 1970s  patches of the lake were declared dead because of industrial waste as well as sewage from runoffs  as New York Times reporter Denny Lee wrote in 2004   The lake  after all  is where the Rust Belt meets the water    The water quality deteriorated partially due to increasing levels of the nutrient phosphorus in both the water and lake bottom sediments  The resultant high nitrogen levels in the water caused eutrophication  which resulted in algal blooms and Algae masses and fish kills increasingly fouled the shoreline during this period  There were incidents of the oily surfaces of tributary rivers emptying into Lake Erie catching fire  in 1969  Cleveland s Cuyahoga River erupted in flames  chronicled in a Time Magazine article which lamented a tendency to use rivers flowing through major cities as  convenient  free sewers   the Detroit River caught fire on another occasion  The outlook was gloomy   These events embarrassed officials and spurred local officials  including Cleveland s director of public utilities  Ben Stefanski  to pursue a massive effort to  scrub the Cuyahoga   the effort cost $100 million in bonds  according to one estimate  New sewer lines were built  Clevelanders approved a bond issue by 2 to 1 to seriously upgrade Cleveland s sewage system  Federal officials acted as well  the United States Congress passed the Clean Water Act of 1972  In that year  the United States and Canada established water pollution limits in an International Water Quality Agreement  The Cotps  LEWMS mentioned above  was also instituted at that time  The controls were effective  but it took several decades to take effect  by 1999  there were signs that large numbers of mayflies were spotted on the lake after a forty year absence signalling a return to health  The clearing of the water column is also partly due to the introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from Europe  which had the effect of covering  the basin floor like shag carpeting  with each creature filtering  a liter of fresh water a day   helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state  The 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement also significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake  The lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and sea weed  but a dead zone persists in the central Lake Erie Basin during the late summer  The United States Environmental Protection Agency has studied this cyclic phenomenon since 2005  There have been instances of beach closings at Presque Isle off the coast of northwestern Pennsylvania because of unexplained E  Coli contaminations  possibly caused by storm water overflows after heavy downpours  Since the 1970s environmental regulation has led to a great increase in water quality and the return of economically important fish species such as walleye and other biological life  There was substantial evidence that the new controls had substantially reduced levels of DDT in the water by 1979  Cleanup efforts were described in 1979 as a notable environmental success story  suggesting that the cumulative effect of legislation  studies  and bans had reversed the effects of pollution   Joint U S –Canadian agreements pushed 600 of 864 major industrial dischargers to meet requirements for keeping the water clean  One estimate was that $5 billion was spent to upgrade plants to treat sewage  The change toward cleaner water has been in a positive direction since the 1970s   4 2 8  Other ecosystem related issues  There was a tentative exploratory plan to capture CO2  compress it to a liquid form  and pump it a half mile  800 m  beneath Lake Erie s surface underneath the porous rock structure  According to chemical engineer Peter Douglas  there is sufficient storage space beneath Lake Erie to hold between 15 to 50 years of liquid CO2 emissions from the 4 000 megawatt Nanticoke coal plant  But there has been no substantial progress on this issue since 2007   5  Economy  5 1  Fishing  5 1 1  Species of fish  Lake Erie is home to one of the world s largest freshwater commercial fisheries  Lake Erie s fish populations are the most abundant of the Great Lakes  partially because of the lake s relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton  which is the basic building block of the food chain  The lake s fish population accounts for an estimated 50% of all fish inhabiting the Great Lakes  The lake is  loaded with superstars  such as steelhead  walleye  American usage  or pickerel  Canadian usage   smallmouth bass  perch  as well as bass  trout  salmon  whitefesh  smelt  and many others  The lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species  Common non indigenous fish species include the rainbow smelt  alewife  white perch and common carp  Non native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch  Attempts failed to stock coho salmon and its numbers are once again dwindling  Commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye  with substantial quantities of rainbow smelt and white bass also taken  Anglers target walleye and yellow perch  with some effort directed at rainbow trout  A variety of other species are taken in smaller quantities by both commercial and sport fleets   Up until the end of the 1950s  the most commonly caught commercial fish  more than 50% of the commercial catch  was a subspecies of the walleye known as the Blue Walleye  sander vitreus glaucus  sometimes erroneously called  blue pike   In the 1970s and 1980s  as pollution in the lake declined  counts of Walleyes which were caught grew from 112 000 in 1975 to 4 1 million in 1985  with estimates of the numbers of Walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin  with many of 8 pounds or more  Not all Walleyes thrived  The combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse  and in the mid 1980s  one species of Walleye called the Blue Walleye was declared extinct  But the Lake Erie Walleye was reportedly having record numbers  even in 1989  according to one report  There have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in Walleye fish  a study by the Canadian Ministry of the Environment noted an  increasing concentration trend  but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in Pennsylvania  It was recommended  because of PCBs  that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month  Because of these and other concerns  in 1990  the National Wildlife Federation was on the verge of having a  negative fish consumption advisory  for walleyes and smallmouth bass  which had been the bread and butter catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry   The longest fish in Lake Erie is reportedly the sturgeon which can grow to ten feet long and weight 300 pounds  but it is an endangered species and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake  In 2009  there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught  which was returned to the lake alive  and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging   5 1 2  Commercial fishing  Estimates vary about the fishing market for the Great Lakes region  One estimate of the total market for fishing  including commercial as well as sport or recreational fishing  for all of the Great Lakes  was $4 billion annually  in 2007  A second estimate was that the fishing industry was valued at more than $7 billion   But since high levels of pollution were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s  there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing  Commercial fishing in Lake Erie has been hurt by the bad economy as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch  one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two thirds in recent decades  Another concern had been that pollution in the lake  as well as toxins found inside fish  were working against commercial fishing interests  U S  fishermen based along Lake Erie  lost their livelihood  over the past few decades described as being  caught in a net of laws and bans   according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette  and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in New York  Pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help  compensate commercial fishermen for their losses   but this program ended after five years turning Erie s commercial fishing industry into an  artifact   One blamed the commercial fishing ban after a  test of wills  between commercial and recreational fishermen   One side needed large hauls  The other feared the lake was being emptied    Commercial fishing is now predominantly based in Canadian communities  with a much smaller fishery—largely restricted to yellow perch—in Ohio  One account suggested that Canadian fishermen are  still at it and making money  and they  know how to fish  by  using the old nets   The Ontario fishery is one of the most intensively managed in the world  However  there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas  and have sued their government about this matter  and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is  dominated by the U S   and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests  Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007  The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system  Still  the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery  In November 2010  Ontario s oldest and largest fish processor known as Great Lakes Fish Corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years  130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared  such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops  According to one report  the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake s largest fishing fleet  and the town features miniature golf  dairy bars  French fry stands  and restaurants serving perch   5 1 3  Government regulation of fishing  The lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes including being a fishery  There was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen  including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses  throughout the lake s history  with both sides seeking government assistance from either Washington or Ottawa  and trying to make their case in the  court  of public opinion through newspaper reporting  But other groups have entered the political process as well  including environmentalists  lakefront property owners  industry owners and workers seeking cost effective solutions for sewage  ferry boat operators  even corporations making electric generating wind turbines   Management of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and include the states of New York  Pennsylvania  Ohio  Michigan and the province of Ontario  and work under the mandate of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission  The commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems  The Commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination  primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the U S  which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests  This conflict is complex  dating from the 1960s and earlier  with the result in the United States that  in 2011  commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from Great Lakes states  One report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around Lake Michigan and evolved to cover the entire Great Lakes region  The analysis suggests that in the Lake Erie context  the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural  not scientific  and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data   5 1 4  Sport fishing  The lake also supports a strong sport fishery  While commercial fishing declined  sport fishing has remained  The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the Canadian side of the lake  As a result  a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport  If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake  upon returning to the American shore  passengers will have to  drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures  to Customs officers by videophone  There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well  who will have to fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving  officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft   Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what s called a put grow and take fishery  There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side  from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone  during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined  and after populations of Walleye increased substantially in the lake  In 1984  Ohio sold 27 000 nonresident fishing permits  and sport fishing was described as big business  In 1992  there were accounts of fishermen catching 8  10  and 12 pound Walleyes  and that the  runt of a five man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds   It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot  also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout  mudblow  lawyer fish  cusk  or freshwater cod which looks  ugly  but tastes great  the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of  Erie s glacial relics    5 1 5  Ice fishing  In winter when the lake freezes  many fisherman go out on the ice  cut holes  and fish  It is possible to even build bonfires on the ice  But venturing on Lake Erie ice can be dangerous  In a freak incident in 2009  warming temperatures and winds of 35 miles per hour and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles wide ice floe which broke away from the shore  trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore  one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats   5 2  Agriculture  The lake s formerly more extensive lakebed creates a favorable environment for agriculture in the bordering areas of Ontario  Ohio  Michigan  Pennsylvania  and New York  The Lake Erie sections of western New York State have a suitable climate for growing grapes  and in Chautauqua County there have been many vineyards and wineries in the area as well as in Erie County in northwestern Pennsylvania  Much grape juice is produced in this region  The Canadian region of Lake Erie s north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well  it has been dubbed the Lake Erie North Shore  or LENS region  and includes Pelee Island  and since it is farther north than comparable wine growing areas in the world  the season is longer in terms of light  A longer growing season due to the lake moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely   The drainage basin has led to well fertilized soil  The north coast of Ohio is widely referred to as its nursery capital   5 3  Tourism  5 3 1  Diving for shipwrecks  Lake Erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks  perhaps 1 400 to 8 000 according to one estimate  of which about 270 are  confirmed shipwreck locations   Most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and in good condition and at most only below the water surface  One report suggests there are more  wrecks per square mile  than any other freshwater location  including wrecks from Native American watercraft  There are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites  possibly for further study or exploration  While the lake is relatively warmer than the other Great Lakes  there is a thermocline  meaning that as a diver descends  the water temperature drops about   requiring a wetsuit  One estimate is that Lake Erie has a quarter of all 8 000 estimated shipwrecks in the Great Lakes  They are preserved because the water is cold and salt free creating  intact time capsules down there   Divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck else the  next person won t be able to see it   when artifacts were removed on occasion  it was met by  outrage  by the diving community  The cold conditions make diving difficult and  strenuous  requiring divers with skill and experience  One charter firm from western New York State takes about 1 500 divers to Lake Erie shipwrecks in a typical season from April through October   In 1991  the 19th century sidewheeler Atlantic was discovered  It had sunk in a collision with the Ogdensburg  a steamship sometimes referred to as a propeller according to 19th century parlance  in 1852 six miles  10 km  west of Long Point  Ontario and survivors from the Atlantic were saved by the Ogdensburg  One account suggests 130 people drowned while another suggests about 20 drowned  The aftermath of the disaster led to calls for authorities to seize captains of both ships so  that the cause of the collision may be correctly ascertained  as well as calls for more lifeboats and improved life preservers since the earlier ones proved to be  totally useless   There was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship  and therefore there might have been money aboard  but most historians were skeptical  In 1998  the shipwreck of the vessel Adventure was the first shipwreck registered with the state of Ohio as an  underwater archaeological site   when it was discovered that the Adventure s propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard  the propeller was rescued days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site and back to its underwater home  In 2003  divers discovered the steamer Canobie near Presque Isle  which sunk in 1921  Other wrecks include the fish tub Neal H  Dow  1910   the Elderado  steamer cum barge   1880   the W  R  Hanna  the Dundee which sank north of Cleveland in 1900  the F  H  Prince  and The Craftsman  In 2007  the wreck of the steamship named after Mad Anthony Wayne was found near Vermilion  Ohio in 50 feet  15 m  of water  the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded  and 38 people died  The wreck belongs to the state of Ohio and  salvaging it is illegal  but divers can visit it after it is surveyed  In addition  there are wrecks of smaller vessels  with occasional drownings of fishermen   The finding of the well preserved wreck of the Canadian built British troop transport warship Caledonia  sunk during the War of 1812  has led to accusations about plundering of the site and legal wrangling about whether the vessel should be resurfaced in time for the 2013 war s bicentennial   Research into shipwrecks has been organized by the Peachman Lake Erie Shipwreck Research Center  or PLESRC  located on the grounds of the Great Lakes Historical Society  In 2008  the Great Lakes Historical Society announced plans to survey the underwater battle site of the Battle of Lake Erie in preparation for the bicentennial celebration of the battle in 2013   5 3 2  Public parks  There are numerous public parks around the lake  In western Pennsylvania  a wildlife reserve was established in 1991 in Springfield Township for hiking  fishing  cross country skiing and walking along the beach  In Ontario  Long Point is a peninsula on the northwest shore near Port Rowan that extends into Lake Erie which is a stopover for birds migrating as well as turtles  one reporter found a  turtle crossing  sign along the road  Long Point Provincial Park is located there and has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve  In Ontario s Sand Hill Park  east of Port Burwell  there is a high dune which is so steep it requires people to  crawl like crabs to the summit  but they are rewarded with spectacular lake views   Crystal Beach  in the Village of Crystal Beach  Ontario  at the Eastern end of the Lake  is one of many South facing beaches on the Canadian side  As such  it is perfectly situated for sun lovers and bathers  facing the sun from sunrise to spectacular sunset  The beach is gently sloping with no sharp drop offs or rip currents  and is usually cooled by southwest breezes  even on the hottest days   In southern Michigan  Sterling State Park offers campgrounds  for hiking  biking  fishing  boating  with a sand beach for sunbathing  swimming  and picnicking   5 3 3  Biking  The New York Times reporter Donna Marchetti took a bike tour around the Lake Erie perimeter in 1997  traveling per day and staying at bed and breakfasts  They went through the cities of Cleveland  Erie  Windsor  Detroit and Toledo as well as resort towns  vineyards  and cornfields  The trip highlights were the  small port towns and rural farmlands of southern Ontario   There are few bike repair shops in Ontario on the route   5 3 4  Islands  Lake Erie islands tend to be in the westernmost part of the lake and have different characters  Some of them include   Kelleys Island has activities such as beach lounging  hiking  biking  and viewing the deep glacial grooves in the bedrock limestone   Pelee Island is reached by ferry from Leamington  Ontario or by plane or ferry in Sandusky  Ohio and is the largest of the Lake Erie islands  The island has a unique ecosystem with plants rarely found in Canada such as wild hyacinth  yellow horse gentian  and prickly pear cactus  There are two endangered snakes including the blue racer and the Lake Erie water snake  Songbirds migrate there in spring  and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall   South Bass Island has the island village of Put in Bay  Ohio which attracts young crowds who sometimes are prone to general merriment  It has been described as a party island with scenic rocky cliffs with a year round population in the hundreds that grows during summer   5 3 5  Water sports  Kayaking has become more popular along the lake  particularly in places such as Put in Bay  Ohio  There are spectacular views with steep cliffs with exotic wildlife and  100 miles of paddle friendly shoreline   Long distance swimmers have swum across the lake to set records  for example  a 15 year old amputee swam the stretch across the lake in 2001  In 2008  14 year old Jade Scognamillo swam from New York s Sturgeon Point to Ontario s Crystal Beach and completed the 11 9 mile  19 2 km  swim in five hours  40 minutes and 35 seconds  and also became the youngest swimmer to make the crossing  It is illegal for swimmers younger than 14 to attempt such a crossing  In Port Dover  Ontario  brave swimmers do high dives at the annual Polar Bear Swim on the beach  in 2011  the water was   although the air was warmer  which did not deter 14 year old youth Austin Merrell  Currents can pose a problem  and there have been occasional incidents of drownings   5 3 6  Lighthouses  The lake is dotted by distinct lighthouses  A lighthouse off the coast of Cleveland  beset with cold lake winter spray  has an unusual artistic icy shape  although sometimes ice prevents the light from being seen by maritime vessels   5 3 7  Towns along the lake  A New York Times reporter  biking through the region in 1997  found the Ontario town of Port Stanley to be the  prettiest of the port towns  with a lively  holiday air  but no  ticky tacky commercialism    5 3 8  Vineyards  There are numerous vineyards around the lake  including ones on Pelee Island which makes wines including pinot noir  riesling and chardonnay   5 3 9  Summer rentals  People can rent summer houses and cabins near the lake to enjoy the beaches  swimming  as well as be close to activities such as wine tours and fishing and water parks  Presque Isle is a peninsula jutting out into the lake in northwestern Pennsylvania which has nice beaches  although there were incidents in 2006 when beaches had to be closed because of unexplained unhealthy water conditions with E  Coli bacteria  It was described as a  spit of sand  trees and swamp that arcs off the shore  with seafood restaurants and beautiful sunsets  Pelee Island  Canada s southernmost point and only three miles away from Ohio  is a place that  forces you to do nothing    5 3 10  Pleasure cruises  Pleasure boat operators offer dinner cruises in the Cleveland area on the Cuyahoga River as well as Lake Erie   5 3 11  Folklore  Lake Erie Monster  There have been reports of persons spotting a creature akin to the Loch Ness Monster  but there have been no confirmed reports  There were reports in 1990 of people seeing a  large creature moving in the water about from their boat  described as black in color  about long  with a  snakelike head   and moved as fast as a boat  Five other people reported seeing something similar on three separate occasions but there is no scientific evidence of such a creature  There is a beer named after the Lake Erie Monster as well as a hockey team  There were reports of people spotting a sea creature in the 19th century which was sometimes called Bessie or South Bay Bessie   Lake Erie Mirage Effect  There have been sporadic reports of people in Cleveland being able to see the Canadian shoreline as if it were immediately offshore  even though Canada is from Cleveland  It has been speculated that this is a weather related phenomenon  working on similar principles to a mirage   5 4  Shipping traffic  The lake has been a  bustling thoroughfare  for maritime vessels for centuries  Ships headed eastward can take the Welland Canal and a series of eight locks descending to Lake Ontario which takes about 12 hours  according to one source  Thousands of ships make this journey each year  During the 19th century  ships could enter the Buffalo River and travel the Erie Canal eastward to Albany then south to New York City along the Hudson River  Generally there is heavy traffic on the lake except during the winter months from January through March when ice prevents vessels from traveling safely  In 2007  there was a protest against Ontario s energy policy which allows the shipping of coal in the lake  GreenPeace activists climbed a ladder on a freighter and  locked themselves to the conveyor belt device that helps to unload the ship s cargo   three activists were arrested and the ship was delayed for more than four hours  and anti coal messages were painted on the ship   The ship traffic in Lake Erie being the highest among the Great Lakes and roughest of the lakes has led to it having the highest number of known shipwrecks in the Great Lakes  There have been other accidents as well  for example  in 2010 according to The Star  crewmen from the freighter Hermann Schoening were sickened by phosphine gas which had been used to fumigate or control pests  rescuers took them by tugboat to receive medical attention   5 5  Ports  The Port of Cleveland generated over $350 million and over 15 million tons of cargo in a recent year  The port will begin work on a new set of docks with more efficient railway  road  and crane access  The current port facility is unable to handle larger cargo ships  and the cranes needed to lift goods such as steel to truck trailers are insufficient to meet current shipping standards  This project is planned to start in 2010 and will be completed by 2020   5 6  Ferryboats  Ferryboats operate in numerous places  But plans to operate a ferryboat between the U S  port of Erie and the Ontario port of Port Dover ran into a slew of political problems  including security restrictions on both sides as well as additional fees required to hire border inspectors  In particular  Canada was described as having a  sticky set of laws   the project was abandoned   The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St  Lawrence River  One reporter thought the roads on the Canadian side were narrower  sometimes without shoulders  but were less trafficked except for the roads around the Ontario towns of Fort Erie and Port Colborne  Drivers can cross from the United States to the Canadian town of Fort Erie by going over the Peace Bridge   5 7  Lake Erie airspace  In 2004  debris from a plane carrying 9 people was found off Lake Erie isle   5 8  Border crossings  Since the border between the two nations is largely unpatrolled  it is possible for people to cross undetected from one country to the other  in either direction  by boat  In 2010  Canadian police arrested persons crossing the border illegally from the United States to Canada  near the Ontario town of Amherstburg   6  See also  Bass Islands  Battle of Lake Erie  Bessie  Cedar Point  Erie Canal  Lake Erie AVA  List of lakes by area  List of lakes in Ohio  Maumee Bay  6 1  Great Lakes in general
