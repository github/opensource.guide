Although she was born in New York City  her parents divorced and she grew up in Maryland  living with an aunt and uncle for some years  As Nancy Davis  she was an actress in Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s  starring in films such as Donovan s Brain  Night Into Morning  and Hellcats of the Navy  the latter opposite Ronald Reagan   In 1952  she married Ronald  who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild  and they had two children  Reagan was the First Lady of California when her husband was Governor from 1967 to 1975  and she began to work with the Foster Grandparents Program   Nancy Reagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981 following her husband s election  She was criticized early in his first term largely due to her decision to replace the White House china  despite its being paid for by private donations  Nancy restored a Kennedy esque glamour to the White House following years of lax formality  and her interest in high end fashion garnered much attention  as well as criticism  She championed recreational drug prevention causes by founding the  Just Say No  drug awareness campaign  which was considered her major initiative as First Lady  More controversy ensued when it was revealed in 1988 that she  always protective of her husband  had consulted an astrologer to assist in planning the president s schedule after the 1981 assassination attempt on her husband  She had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions   The Reagans retired to their home in Bel Air  Los Angeles  California in 1989  Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her ailing husband  diagnosed in 1994 with Alzheimer s disease  until his death in 2004  Nancy Reagan has remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics  particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research   1  Early life and education  Anne Frances Robbins was born on July 6  1921  at Manhattan s Sloane Hospital for Women in New York  as the only child of car salesman Kenneth Seymour Robbins  1894–1972  and his actress wife  Edith Luckett  1888–1987   Her godmother was silent film star Alla Nazimova  From birth  she was commonly called Nancy   She lived her first two years in Flushing  Queens  in New York  While her parents divorced soon after her birth  they had already been separated for some time  As her mother traveled the country to pursue acting jobs  Nancy was raised in Bethesda  Maryland for the next six years by her aunt Virginia and uncle Audley Gailbraith  Nancy describes longing for her mother during those years   My favorite times were when Mother had a job in New York  and Aunt Virgie would take me by train to stay with her    In 1929  her mother married Loyal Davis  1896–1982   a prominent  politically conservative neurosurgeon who moved the family to Chicago  Nancy and her stepfather got along very well  Nancy would later write that he was  a man of great integrity who exemplified old fashioned values   He formally adopted her in 1935  and she would always refer to him as her father  At the time of the adoption  her name was legally changed to Nancy Davis  She attended the Girls  Latin School of Chicago  describing herself as an average student   graduated in 1939  and later attended Smith College in Massachusetts  where she majored in English and Drama and graduated in 1943   2  Acting career  In 1940  a young Davis had appeared as a National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio  The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms  laughing over its victims  until finally dispelled by the volunteer  It was very effective in raising contributions   Following her graduation from college  Davis held jobs in Chicago as a sales clerk in Marshall Field s department store and as a nurse s aide  With the help of her mother s colleagues in theatre  including Zasu Pitts  Walter Huston  and Spencer Tracy  she pursued a career as a professional actress  She first gained a part in Pitts  1945 road tour of Ramshackle Inn  moving to New York City  She landed the role of Si Tchun  a lady in waiting  in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient  Lute Song  starring Mary Martin and a pre stardom Yul Brynner  The show s producer told her   You look like you could be Chinese    After passing a screen test  she moved to California and signed a seven year contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios  MGM  in 1949  she later remarked   Joining Metro was like walking into a dream world   Her combination of attractive appearance – centered around her large eyes – and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for MGM to cast and publicize  Davis appeared in eleven feature films  usually typecast as a  loyal housewife    responsible young mother   or  the steady woman   Jane Powell  Debbie Reynolds  Leslie Caron  and Janet Leigh were among those that she competed with for roles at MGM   Davis  film career began with small supporting roles in two films of 1949  The Doctor and the Girl with Glenn Ford and East Side  West Side starring Barbara Stanwyck  She played a child psychiatrist in the film noir Shadow on the Wall  1950  with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott  her performance was called  beautiful and convincing  by New York Times critic A  H  Weiler  She co starred in 1950 s The Next Voice You Hear     playing a pregnant housewife who hears the voice of God from her radio  Influential reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that  Nancy Davis  is  delightful as  a  gentle  plain  and understanding wife   In 1951  Davis appeared in her favorite screen role  Night Into Morning  a study of bereavement starring Ray Milland  Crowther said that Davis  does nicely as the fiancée who is widowed herself and knows the loneliness of grief   while another noted critic  The Washington Posts Richard L  Coe  said Davis  is splendid as the understanding widow   MGM released Davis from her contract in 1952  she sought a broader range of parts  but also married Reagan  keeping her professional name as Davis  and had her first child that year  She soon starred in the 1953 science fiction film Donovan s Brain  Crowther said that Davis  playing the role of a possessed scientist s  sadly baffled wife    walked through it all in stark confusion  in an  utterly silly  film  In her next to last movie  Hellcats of the Navy  1957   she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband  playing what one critic called  a housewife who came along for the ride   Another reviewer  however  stated that Davis plays her part well  and  does well with what she has to work with    Author Garry Wills believes that Davis was underrated as an actress overall because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance  In addition  Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals  MGM promotional material in 1949 said that her  greatest ambition  was to have a  successful happy marriage   decades later  in 1975  she would say   I was never really a career woman but  became one  only because I hadn t found the man I wanted to marry  I couldn t sit around and do nothing  so I became an actress   Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a  reliable  and  solid  performer who held her own in performances with better known actors  After her final film  Crash Landing  1958   Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas such as Wagon Train and The Tall Man until 1962  when she retired as an actress  During her career  Davis served on the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild for nearly ten years  Decades later  Albert Brooks attempted to coax her out of acting retirement by offering her the title role opposite himself in his 1996 film Mother  She declined in order to care for her husband  and Debbie Reynolds played the part   3  Marriage and family  During her Hollywood career  Davis dated many actors  including Clark Gable  Robert Stack  and Peter Lawford  she later called Gable the nicest of the stars she had met  On November 15  1949  she met Ronald Reagan  who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild  Nancy had noticed that her name had appeared on the Hollywood blacklist and sought Reagan s help to maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood  and for assistance in having her name removed from the list  Reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name  The two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns  one Hollywood press account described their nightclub free times together as  the romance of a couple who have no vices   Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage  however  following his painful 1948 divorce from Jane Wyman  and he still saw other women  After three years of dating  he eventually proposed to Davis in the couple s favorite booth at the Beverly Hills restaurant Chasen s  They married on March 4  1952 in a simple ceremony designed to avoid the press at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  The only people in attendance were actor William Holden  the best man  and his wife  actress Brenda Marshall  the matron of honor  The couple s first child  Patricia Ann Reagan  better known by her professional name  Patti Davis   was born on October 21  1952  Their son  Ronald Prescott Reagan  was born six years later on May 20  1958  Nancy Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan  1941–2001  and Michael Reagan  born 1945   the children of her husband s first marriage to Jane Wyman   Observers described Ronald and Nancy Reagan s relationship as intimate  As President and First Lady  the Reagans were reported to display their affection frequently  with one press secretary noting   They never took each other for granted  They never stopped courting   Ronald often called Nancy  Mommy   she called him  Ronnie   While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt  Nancy Reagan wrote in her diary   Nothing can happen to my Ronnie  My life would be over   In a letter to Nancy  Ronald wrote   whatever I treasure and enjoy     all would be without meaning if I didn t have you   In 1998  while her husband was afflicted with Alzheimer s disease  Nancy told Vanity Fair   Our relationship is very special  We were very much in love and still are  When I say my life began with Ronnie  well  it s true  It did  I can t imagine life without him   Nancy was known for the focused and attentive look  termed  the Gaze   that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances  President Reagan s death in June 2004 ended what Charlton Heston called  the greatest love affair in the history of the American Presidency    Nancy s relationship with her children was not always as close as that with her husband  She frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren  Her relationship with Patti was the most contentious  Patti flouted American conservatism and rebelled against her parents by joining the nuclear freeze movement and authoring many anti Reagan books  The nearly 20 years of family feuding left her very much estranged from both her mother and father  Soon after her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease  Patti and her mother reconciled and began to speak on a daily basis  Nancy s disagreements with Michael were also public matters  in 1984  she was quoted as saying that the two were in an  estrangement right now   Michael responded that Nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter  Ashley  who had been born nearly a year earlier  They too eventually made peace  Nancy was thought to be closest to her stepdaughter Maureen during the White House years  but each of the Reagan children experienced periods of estrangement from their parents   4  First Lady of California  1967–1975  Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband s two terms as governor  She disliked living in Sacramento  which lacked the excitement  social life  and mild climate to which she was accustomed in Los Angeles  She first attracted controversy early in 1967  when  after four months  residence in the California Governor s Mansion in Sacramento  she moved her family into a wealthy suburb because fire officials had labeled the mansion as a  firetrap   Though the Reagans leased the new house at their expense  the move was viewed as snobbish  Nancy defended her actions as being for the good of her family  a judgment with which her husband readily agreed  Friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house  while Nancy Reagan supervised construction of a new ranch style governor s residence in nearby Carmichael  The new residence was finished just as Ronald Reagan left office in 1975  but his successor  Jerry Brown  refused to live there  It was sold in 1982  and California governors have been living in improvised arrangements ever since   In 1967  Nancy Reagan was appointed by her husband to the California Arts Commission  and a year later was named Los Angeles Times  Woman of the Year  in its profile  the Times labeled her  A Model First Lady   Her glamour  style  and youthfulness made her a frequent subject for press photographers  As first lady  Reagan visited veterans  the elderly  and the handicapped  and worked with a number of charities  She became involved with the Foster Grandparents Program  helping to popularize it in the United States and Australia  She later expanded her work with the organization after arriving in Washington  and wrote about her experiences in her 1982 book To Love a Child  The Reagans held dinners for former POWs and Vietnam War veterans while governor and first lady   5  Role in 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns  Governor Reagan s term ended in 1975  and he did not run for a third  instead  he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the presidency in 1976  challenging incumbent President Gerald Ford  Reagan still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running  however  She feared for her husband s health and his career as a whole  though she felt that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved  Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign  holding coffees  luncheons  and talks with senior citizens  With that  she oversaw personnel  monitored her husband s schedule  and occasionally provided press conferences  The 1976 campaign included the so called  battle of the queens   contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford  They both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues  but with different approaches  Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband   Though he lost the 1976 Republican nomination  Reagan ran again for the presidency in 1980 and succeeded in winning the nomination and election  During this second campaign  Nancy played a very prominent role and her management of staff became more apparent  She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver and her husband  which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control  After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls  Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates  she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal  Her influence on her husband became particularly notable  her presence at rallies  luncheons  and receptions increased his confidence   6  First Lady of the United States  1981–1989  6 1  White House glamour  6 1 1  Renovation  Nancy Reagan became the First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president in January 1981  Early in her husband s presidency  Reagan stated her desire to create a more suitable  first home  in the White House  as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect  White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having  cracked plaster walls  chipped paint  and  beaten up floors   rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate  she sought private donations  In 1981  Nancy directed a major renovation of several White House rooms  including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office  including the press briefing room  The renovation included repainting walls  refinishing floors  repairing fireplaces  and replacing antique pipes  windows  and wires  The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room  and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium   The first lady secured the assistance of renowned interior designer Ted Graber  popular with affluent West Coast social figures  to redecorate the family living quarters  A Chinese pattern  handpainted wallpaper was added to the master bedroom  Family furniture was placed in the president s private study  The first lady and her designer retrieved a number of White House antiques  which had been in storage  and placed them throughout the mansion   The extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations  Many significant and long lasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment  of which Nancy Reagan said   This house belongs to all Americans  and I want it to be something of which they can be proud   The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax deductible donations  meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax paying public   6 1 2  Fashion  Another of Nancy Reagan s trademarks was her interest in fashion  While her husband was still president elect  press reports speculated about Nancy s social life and interest in fashion  In many press accounts  Nancy s sense of style was favorably compared to that of previous First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy  Friends and those close to her remarked that  while fashionable like Kennedy  she would be different from other first ladies  close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying   Nancy has her own imprint    Nancy Reagan s wardrobe consisted of dresses  gowns  and suits made by luxury designers  including James Galanos  Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta  Her white  hand beaded  one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10 000  while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25 000  She favored the color red  calling it  a picker upper   and wore it accordingly  Her wardrobe included red so often that the fire engine shade became known as  Reagan red   She employed two private hairdressers who would style her hair on a regular basis in the White House   Fashion designers were pleased with the emphasis Nancy Reagan placed on clothing  Adolfo said the first lady embodied an  elegant  affluent  well bred  chic American look   while Bill Blass commented   I don t think there s been anyone in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who has her flair   William Fine  president of cosmetic company Frances Denney  noted that she  stays in style  but she doesn t become trendy    Though her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a  glamorous paragon of chic   they were also controversial subjects  In 1982  she revealed that she had accepted thousands of dollars in clothing  jewelry  and other gifts  but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes and that they would either be returned or donated to museums  and that she was promoting the American fashion industry  Facing criticism  she soon said she would no longer accept such loans  While often buying her clothes  she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady  which came to light in 1988  None of this had been included on financial disclosure forms  the non reporting of loans under $10 000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the White House had made in 1982  while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the Ethics in Government Act  Nancy expressed through her press secretary  regrets that she failed to heed counsel s advice  on disclosing them   Despite the controversy  many designers who allowed her to borrow clothing noted that the arrangement was good for their businesses as well as for the American fashion industry overall  In 1989  Nancy was honored at the annual gala awards dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America  during which she received the council s lifetime achievement award  Barbara Walters said of her   She has served every day for eight long years the word  style     6 1 3  Elegance and formality  Approximately a year into her husband s first term  Nancy Reagan explored the idea of ordering new state china service for the White House  A full china service had not been purchased since the Truman administration in the 1940s  as only a partial service was ordered in the Johnson administration  She was quoted as saying   The White House really badly  badly needs china   Working with Lenox  the primary porcelain manufacturer in America  the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band  bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center  The full service comprised 4 370 pieces  with 19 pieces per individual set  The service totaled $209 508  Although it was paid for by private donations  some from the private Knapp Foundation  the purchase generated quite a controversy  for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an economic recession   The new china  White House renovations  expensive clothing  and her attendance at the wedding of Charles and Diana  Prince and Princess of Wales  gave her an aura of being  out of touch  with the American people during an economic recession  This and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname  Queen Nancy   While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits  Reagan s treatment was much more consistent and negative  In an attempt to deflect the criticism  she self deprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 Gridiron Dinner and sang  Second Hand Clothes   mimicking the song  Second Hand Rose   The skit helped to restore her reputation   Nancy Reagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography  My Turn  Reagan describes lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert Strauss  wherein Strauss said to her   When you first came to town  Nancy  I didn t like you at all  But after I got to know you  I changed my mind and said   She s some broad    Nancy responded   Bob  based on the press reports I read then  I wouldn t have liked me either    After the presidencies of Gerald Ford  who favored the Michigan fight song over  Hail to the Chief   and Jimmy Carter  who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions   Nancy brought a Kennedy esque glamour back into the White House  She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years  compared to six by George and Laura Bush  She remarked that hosting the dinners is  the easiest thing in the world  You don t have to do anything  Just have a good time and do a little business  And that s the way Washington works   In 1987  Mikhail Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader to visit Washington  D C  since Nikita Khrushchev in 1959  and Nancy Reagan was in charge of planning and hosting the important and highly anticipated state dinner  After the meal  Nancy recruited pianist Van Cliburn to sing a rendition of  Moscow Nights  for the Soviet delegation  to which Mikhail and Raisa broke out into song  Former Secretary of State George Shultz commented on the evening  saying  We felt the ice of the Cold War crumbling   Nancy concluded   It was a perfect ending for one of the great evenings of my husband s presidency    6 2  Just Say No  Nancy Reagan launched the  Just Say No  drug awareness campaign in 1982  which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady  Nancy first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop Village  New York  She remarked in 1981 that  Understanding what drugs can do to your children  understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is     the first step in solving the problem   Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse   In 1982  Nancy Reagan was asked by a schoolgirl what to do when offered drugs  Nancy responded  Just say no   The phrase proliferated in the popular culture of the 1980s and was eventually adopted as the name of club organizations and school anti drug programs  Reagan became actively involved by traveling more than throughout the United States and several nations  visiting drug abuse prevention programs and drug rehabilitation centers  She also appeared on television talk shows  recorded public service announcements  and wrote guest articles  She appeared in an episode of the hit television drama Dynasty to underscore support for the anti drug campaign  As she continued to promote  Just Say No   she appeared in an episode of the popular 1980s sitcom Diff rent Strokes and in a 1985 rock music video   Stop the Madness   When asked about her campaign  the first lady remarked   If you can save just one child  it s worth it    In 1985  Nancy expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the First Ladies of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse  On October 27  1986  President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law  which granted $1 7 billion in funding to fight the crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses  Although the bill was criticized by some  Nancy Reagan considered it a personal victory  In 1988  she became the first First Lady invited to address the United Nations General Assembly  where she spoke on international drug interdiction and trafficking laws   Critics of Reagan s efforts questioned their purpose and argued that the program did not go far enough in addressing many social issues  including unemployment  poverty  and family dissolution  Nancy s approach to promoting drug awareness was labeled as simplistic by liberal critics  Nonetheless  a number of  Just Say No  clubs and organizations remain in operation around the country  and they aim to educate children and teenagers about the effects of drugs   6 3  Her husband s protector  Nancy Reagan assumed the role of unofficial  protector  for her husband after the attempted assassination on his life in 1981  On March 30 of that year  President Reagan and three others were shot as they left the Washington Hilton Hotel  Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital  where the President was hospitalized  She recalled having seen  emergency rooms before  but I had never seen one like this—with my husband in it   She was escorted into a waiting room  and when granted access to see her husband  he quipped to her   Honey  I forgot to duck   borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey s jest to his wife   An early example of her protective nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the President s hospital room that day in March  passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President s  close friend   presumably to acquire media attention  Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave  While the president recuperated in the hospital  the first lady slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by the scent  When Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12  she escorted him back to the White House   Press accounts framed Nancy as her husband s  chief protector   an extension of their general initial framing of her as a helpmate and a Cold War domestic ideal   6 4  Influence in the White House  Nancy stated in her memoirs   I felt panicky every time  Ronald  left the White House  following the assassination attempt  and made it her concern to know her husband s schedule  the events he would be attending  and with whom  Eventually  this protectiveness led to her consulting an astrologer  Joan Quigley  who offered insight on which days were  good    neutral   or should be avoided  which influenced her husband s White House schedule  Days were color coded according to the astrologer s advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the president s safety and success  The White House Chief of Staff  Donald Regan  grew frustrated with this regimen  which created friction between him and the First Lady  This escalated with the revelation of the Iran Contra affair  an administration scandal  in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president  She thought he should resign  and expressed this to her husband although he did not share her view  Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference  though Nancy refused to allow Reagan to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings  Regan became so angry with Nancy that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation  According to former ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson  when the President heard of this treatment  he demanded—and eventually received—Regan s resignation  In his 1988 memoirs  Regan wrote about Nancy s consultations with the astrologer  the first public mention of them  which resulted in embarrassment for the First Lady  Nancy later wrote   Astrology was simply one of the ways I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died    Was astrology one of the reasons  further attempts did not occur   I don t really believe it was  but I don t really believe it wasn t    Nancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan  Again stemming from the assassination attempt  she strictly controlled access to the president and even occasionally attempted to influence her husband s decision making   Beginning in 1985  Nancy strongly encouraged her husband to hold  summit  conferences with Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev  and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand  Both Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations  The relationship between Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev was anything but the friendly  diplomatic one between their husbands  Nancy found Raisa hard to converse with and their relationship was described as  frosty   The two women usually had tea  and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States  Visiting the U S  for the first time in 1987  Raisa irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism  reportedly prompting the American President s wife to quip   Who does that dame think she is    Press framing of Nancy changed from that of just helpmate and protector to someone with hidden power  As the image of her as a political interloper grew  she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne  At the end of her time as First Lady  however  she said that her husband had not been well served by his staff  She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions  saying  In no way do I apologize for it   She wrote in her memoirs   I don t think I was as bad  or as extreme in my power or my weakness  as I was depicted   but went on    H owever the first lady fits in  she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband  And it s only natural that she ll let him know what she thinks  I always did that for Ronnie  and I always will    6 5  Breast cancer  In October 1987  a mammogram detected a lesion in Nancy Reagan s left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer  She chose to undergo a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy and the breast was removed on October 17  1987  Ten days after the operation  her mother  Edith Luckett Davis  died in Phoenix  Arizona  leading Nancy to dub the period  a terrible month    After the surgery  more women across the country had mammograms  an example of the influence the First Lady possessed   7  Subsequent life  Though Nancy was a controversial First Lady  56 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on January 20  1989  with 18 percent having an unfavorable opinion and the balance not giving an opinion  Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands left office  Reagan s approval was higher than those of Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Rodham Clinton  however she was less popular than Barbara Bush and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter s   Upon leaving the White House  the couple returned to California  where they purchased a home in the wealthy East Gate Old Bel Air neighborhood of Bel Air  Los Angeles  dividing their time between Bel Air and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara  California  Ronald and Nancy regularly attended Bel Air Presbyterian Church as well  After leaving Washington  Nancy made numerous public appearances  many on behalf of her husband  She continues to reside at the Bel Air home  where she lived with her husband until his death on June 5  2004   7 1  Early post White House activities  In late 1989  the former First Lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation  which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse  The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug Free Tomorrow in 1994  and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program  She continued to travel around the nation  speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse  After President Reagan revealed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease in 1994  she made herself his primary caregiver and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer s Association and its affiliate  the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago  Illinois   Also in 1989 she published My Turn  The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan  which gives an account of her life in the White House  speaking openly about her influence within the Reagan administration and discussing the myths and controversies that surrounded the couple  In 1991  the controversial author Kitty Kelley wrote an unauthorized and largely uncited biography about Nancy Reagan  repeating accounts of a poor relationship with her children and introducing rumors of alleged sexual relations with singer Frank Sinatra  A wide range of sources commented that Kelley s largely unsupported claims are most likely false   In 1989 the Internal Revenue Service began investigating the Reagans for whether they owed additional tax on the gifts and loans of high fashion clothes and jewelry to Nancy during their time in the White House  recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned   In 1992 the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns  they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest  which was subsequently paid   Nancy Reagan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the nation s highest civilian honor  by President George W  Bush on July 9  2002  President Reagan received his own Presidential Medal of Freedom in January 1993  Nancy and her husband were jointly awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on May 16  2002 at the Capitol  and were only the third President and First Lady to receive it  she accepted the medal on behalf of both of them   7 2  Ronald Reagan s funeral  Ronald Reagan died in their Bel Air home on June 5  2004  During the seven day state funeral  Nancy  accompanied by her children and military escort  led the nation in mourning by keeping a strong composure  traveling from her home to the Reagan Library for a memorial service  then to Washington  D C   where her husband s body lay in state for 34 hours prior to a national funeral service in the Washington National Cathedral  She returned to the library in California for a sunset memorial service and interment  where  overcome with emotion  she lost her composure  crying in public for the first time during the week  After accepting the folded flag  she kissed the casket and mouthed  I love you  before leaving  Journalist Wolf Blitzer said of Reagan during the week   She s a very  very strong woman  even though she looks frail    She had directed the detailed planning of the funeral  including ordering all the major events and asking former President George H  W  Bush as well as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to speak during the National Cathedral Service  She paid very close attention to the details  something she had always done in her husband s life  Betsy Bloomingdale  one of Reagan s closest friends  stated   She looks a little frail  But she is very strong inside  She is  She has the strength  She is doing her last thing for Ronnie  And she is going to get it right   The funeral marked her first major public appearance since delivering a speech to the 1996 Republican National Convention on her husband s behalf   The funeral had a great impact on Reagan s public image  Following substantial criticism during her tenure as first lady  she was seen somewhat as a national heroine  praised by many for supporting and caring for her husband while he suffered from Alzheimer s disease  U S  News & World Report opined   after a decade in the shadows  a different  softer Nancy Reagan emerged    7 3  Widowhood  Reagan has remained active in politics  particularly relating to stem cell research  Beginning in 2004  she favored what many consider to be the Democratic Party s position  and urged President George W  Bush to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer s disease  Although she failed to change the president s position  she did support his campaign for a second term   In 2005  Reagan was honored at a gala dinner at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington  D C  where guests included Dick Cheney  Harry Reid and

being became a prominent concern in 2008  In February she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to St  John s Health Center in Santa Monica  California  Doctors reported that she did not break her hip as feared and she was released from the hospital two days later  News commentators noted that Reagan s step had slowed significantly  as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain  NBC s Brian Williams  who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid 2008  recalled   Mrs  Reagan s vision isn t what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do     I t is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship  She very much is captain of her own ship   As for her mental ability  Williams remarked   She s as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California  but  falling  is always a danger of course  She s a very stoic  hardy person full of joy and excitement for life    She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days    She is  as most of her friends described her  a pistol    In October 2008  Reagan was admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after falling at home  Doctors determined that the 87 year old had fractured her pelvis and sacrum and could recuperate at home with a regimen of physical therapy

more    In March 2009 she praised President Barack Obama for reversing the ban on federally funded embryonic stem cell research  She traveled to Washington  D C  in June 2009 to unveil a statue of her

interview with Vanity Fair that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House  Following the August 2009 death of Senator Edward M  Kennedy  she said she was  terribly saddened     Given our political differences  people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family      I will miss him   She attended the funeral of Betty Ford in Rancho Mirage  California  on July 12  2011   Reagan hosted a 2012 Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Presidential Library on September 7  2011  Her representative said that
