facto capital of the kingdom of France for over a century  from 1682 to 1789  before becoming the cradle of the French Revolution  After having lost its status of royal city  it became the préfecture  regional capital  of Seine et Oise département in 1790  then of Yvelines in 1968  and a Roman Catholic diocese  Versailles is historically known for numerous treaties such as the Treaty of Paris  1783   which ended the American Revolutionary War and the Treaty of Versailles  after World War I   Located in the western suburbs of the French capital  from the centre of Paris  Versailles is in the 21st century a wealthy suburb of Paris with a service based economy and a major touristic destination as well  In addition  the Congress of France – the name given to the body created when both houses of the French Parliament  the National Assembly and the Senate  meet – gathers in the Château de Versailles to vote on revisions to the Constitution   1  Name  The etymology of Versailles is clear that the argument tends to privilege the Latin word versare  meaning  to keep turning  turn over and over   expression used in medieval times for plowed lands  cleared lands  lands that had been repeatedly  turned over    This word formation is similar to Latin seminare   to sow   which gave French semailles   sowings    sown seeds     During the Revolution of 1789  city officials had proposed to the Convention to rename Versailles Berceau de la Liberté   Cradle of Liberty    but they had to retract their proposal when confronted with the objections of the majority of the population   2  A seat of power  From May 1682  when Louis XIV moved the court and government permanently to Versailles  until his death in September 1715  Versailles was the unofficial capital of the kingdom of France  For the next seven years  during the Régence of Philippe d Orléans  the royal court of the young King Louis XV was the first in Paris  while the Regent governed from his Parisian residence  the Palais Royal  Versailles was again the unofficial capital of France from June 1722  when Louis XV returned to Versailles  until October 1789  when a Parisian mob forced Louis XVI and the royal family to move to Paris  Versailles again became the unofficial capital of France from March 1871  when Adolphe Thiers  government took refuge in Versailles  fleeing the insurrection of the Paris Commune  until November 1879  when the newly elected government and parliament returned to Paris  During the various periods when government affairs were conducted from Versailles  Paris remained the official capital of France   Versailles was made the préfecture of the Seine et Oise département at its inception in March 1790  at which time Seine et Oise had approximately 420 000 inhabitants   By the 1960s  with the growth of the Paris suburbs  the Seine et Oise had reached more than 2 million inhabitants  and was deemed too large and ungovernable  and thus it was split into three départements in January 1968  Versailles was made the préfecture of the Yvelines département  the largest chunk of the former Seine et Oise  At the 2006 census the Yvelines had 1 395 804 inhabitants   Versailles is the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese  bishopric  which was created in 1790  The diocese of Versailles is subordinate to the archdiocese of Paris   In 1975  Versailles was made the seat of a Court of Appeal whose jurisdiction covers the western suburbs of Paris   Since 1972  Versailles has been the seat of one of France s 30 nationwide académies  districts  of the Ministry of National Education  The académie de Versailles  the largest of France s thirty académies by its number of pupils and students  is in charge of supervising all the elementary schools and high schools of the western suburbs of Paris   Versailles is also an important node for the French army  a tradition going back to the monarchy with  for instance  the military camp of Satory and other institutions   3  Geography  Versailles is located west southwest from the centre of Paris  The city sits on an elevated plateau  130 to 140 metres  425 to 460 ft  above sea level  whereas the elevation of the centre of Paris is only 33 m  108 ft  above sea level   surrounded by wooded hills  in the north the forests of Marly and Fausses Reposes  and in the south the forests of Satory and Meudon   The city  commune  of Versailles has an area of 26 18 km²  10 11 sq mi  or 6 469 acres   which is a quarter of the area of the city of Paris  In 1999  Versailles had a population density of 3 344 km²  8 660 sq mi   whereas Paris had a density of 20 696 km²  53 602 sq mi    Born out of the will of a king  the city has a rational and symmetrical grid of streets  By the standards of the 18th century  Versailles was a very modern European city  Versailles was used as a model for the building of Washington  D C  by Pierre Charles L Enfant   4  History  The name of Versailles appears for the first time in a medieval document dated 1038  In the feudal system of medieval France  the lords of Versailles came directly under the king of France  with no intermediary overlords between them and the king  yet they were not very important lords  In the end of the 11th century  the village curled around a medieval castle and the Saint Julien church  Its farming activity and its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought prosperity to the village  culminating in the end of the 13th century  the so called  century of Saint Louis   famous for the prosperity of northern France and the building of Gothic cathedrals  The 14th century brought the Black Plague and the Hundred Years  War  and with it death and destruction  At the end of the Hundred Years  War in the 15th century  the village started to recover  with a population of only 100 inhabitants   In 1561  Martial de Loménie  secretary of state for finances under King Charles IX  became lord of Versailles  He obtained permission to establish four annual fairs and a weekly market on Thursdays  The population of Versailles was 500 inhabitants  Martial de Loménie was murdered during the St  Bartholomew s Day massacre  24 August 1572   In 1575  Albert de Gondi  a man from Florence who had come to France with Catherine de  Medici  bought the seigneury of Versailles   4 1  Louis XIII  Henceforth Versailles was the possession of the Gondi family  a family of wealthy and influential parliamentarians at the Parlement of Paris  Several times during the 1610s  the Gondi invited King Louis XIII to hunt in the large forests around Versailles  In 1622  the king purchased a parcel of forest for his private hunting  In 1624  he acquired more and entrusted Philibert Le Roy with the construction of a small hunting lodge of red bricks and stone with a slate roof  In 1632  the king bought the totality of the land and seigneury of Versailles from Jean François de Gondi  The hunting lodge was enlarged to the size of a small château between 1632 and 1634   At the death of Louis XIII  in 1643  the village had 1 000 inhabitants   This small château was the site of one of the historical events that took place during the reign of Louis XIII  on 10 November 1630  when  on the Day of the Dupes  the party of the queen mother was defeated and Richelieu was confirmed as Prime minister   4 2  Louis XIV  King Louis XIV  son of Louis XIII  was only five years old when his father died  It was 20 years later  in 1661  when Louis XIV commenced his personal reign  that the young king showed interest in Versailles  The idea of leaving Paris  where  as a child  he had experienced first hand the insurrection of the Fronde  had never left him  Louis XIV commissioned his architect Le Vau and his landscape architect Le Nôtre to transform the castle of his father  as well as the park  in order to accommodate the court  In 1678  after the Treaty of Nijmegen  the king decided that the court and the government would be established permanently in Versailles  which happened on 6 May 1682   At the same time  a new city was emerging from the ground  resulting from an ingenious decree of the king dated 22 May 1671  whereby the king authorized anyone to acquire a lot in the new city for free  There were only two conditions to acquire a lot  1  a token tax of 5 shillings  5 sols  per arpent of land should be paid every year  $0 03 per per year in 2005 US dollars   2  a house should be built on the lot according to the plans and models established by the Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi  architect in chief of the royal demesne   The plans provided for a city built symmetrically with respect to the Avenue de Paris  which starts from the entrance of the castle   The roofs of the buildings and houses of the new city were not to exceed the level of the Marble Courtyard  at the entrance of the castle  built above a hill dominating the city   so that the perspective from the windows of the castle would not be obstructed   The old village and the Saint Julien church were demolished to make room for buildings housing the administrative services managing the daily life in the castle  On both sides of the Avenue de Paris were built the Notre Dame neighborhood and the Saint Louis neighborhood  with new large churches  markets  aristocratic mansions  all built in very homogeneous style according to the models established by the Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi  Versailles was a vast construction site for many years  Little by little came to Versailles all those who needed or desired to live close to the maximum power  At the death of the Sun King in 1715  the village of Versailles had turned into a city of approximately 30 000 inhabitants   4 3  Louis XV and Louis XVI  When the court of King Louis XV returned to Versailles in 1722  the city had 24 000 inhabitants  With the reign of Louis XV  Versailles grew even further  Versailles was the capital of the most powerful kingdom in Europe  and the whole of Europe admired its new architecture and design trends  Soon enough  the strict building rules decided under Louis XIV were not respected anymore  real estate speculation flourished  and the lots that had been given for free under Louis XIV were now on the market for hefty prices  By 1744  the population reached 37 000 inhabitants  The cityscape changed considerably under kings Louis XV and Louis XVI  Buildings were now taller  King Louis XV built a Ministry of War  a Ministry of Foreign Affairs  where the Treaty of Paris  1783  ending the American Revolutionary War was signed in 1783 with the United Kingdom   and a Ministry of the Navy  By 1789  the population had reached 60 000 inhabitants  and Versailles was now the seventh or eighth largest city of France  and one of the largest cities of Europe   4 4  French Revolution  Seat of the political power  Versailles naturally became the cradle of the French Revolution  The Estates General met in Versailles on 5 May 1789  The members of the Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789  and the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism on 4 August 1789  Eventually  on 5 and 6 October 1789  a crowd of women joined by some members of the national guard from Paris invaded the castle to protest bread prices and forced the royal family to move to Paris  The National Constituent Assembly followed the king to Paris soon afterwards  and Versailles lost its role of capital city   From then on  Versailles lost a good deal of its inhabitants  From 60 000  the population had declined to 26 974 inhabitants by 1806  The castle  stripped of its furniture and ornaments during the Revolution  was left abandoned  with only Napoleon briefly staying one night there and then leaving the castle for good  Louis Philippe  who took the throne in the July Revolution of 1830  saved the castle from total ruin by transforming it into a National Museum dedicated to  all the glories of France  in 1837  Versailles had become a sleepy town  a place of pilgrimage for those nostalgic for the old monarchy   4 5  19th century to the Present day  The Franco Prussian War of 1870 put Versailles in the limelight again  On 18 January 1871  the victorious Germans proclaimed the king of Prussia  Wilhelm I  emperor of Germany in the very Hall of Mirrors of the castle  in an attempt to take revenge for the conquests of Louis XIV two centuries earlier  Then in March of the same year  following the insurrection of the Paris Commune the French government under Thiers relocated to Versailles  from where the insurrection was militarily quelled  The government and the French parliament stayed in Versailles after the quelling of the insurrection  and it was even thought for some time that the capital of France would be moved definitely to Versailles in order to avoid the revolutionary mood of Paris in the future   Restoration of the monarchy was almost realized in 1873 with parliament offering the crown to Henri  comte de Chambord  but his refusal to accept the tricolor flag that had been adopted during the Revolution made the restoration of monarchy impossible for the time being  Versailles was again the political center of France  full of buzz and rumors  with its population briefly peaking at 61 686 in 1872  matching the record level of population reached on the eve of the French Revolution 83 years earlier  Eventually  however  left wing republicans won a string of parliamentary elections  defeating the parties supporting a restoration of the monarchy  and the new majority decided to relocate the government to Paris in November 1879  Versailles then experienced a new population setback  48 324 inhabitants at the 1881 census   After that  Versailles was never again the seat of the capital of France  but the presence of the French Parliament there in the 1870s left a vast hall built in one aisle of the palace which is still used by the French Parliament when it meets in Congress to amend the French Constitution  as well as when the French president addresses the two chambers of the French Parliament   It was not until 1911 that Versailles definitely recovered its level of population of 1789  with 60 458 inhabitants at the 1911 census  In 1919  at the end of the First World War  Versailles was put in the limelight again as the various treaties ending the war were signed in the castle proper and in the Grand Trianon  After 1919  as the suburbs of Paris were ever expanding  Versailles was absorbed by the urban area of Paris and the city experienced a strong demographic and economic growth  turning it into a large suburban city of the metropolitan area of Paris  The role of Versailles as an administrative and judicial center has been reinforced in the 1960s and 1970s  and somehow Versailles has become the main center of the western suburbs of Paris   The center of the town has kept its very bourgeois atmosphere  while more middle class neighborhoods have developed around the train stations and in the outskirts of the city  Versailles is a chic suburb of Paris well linked with the center of Paris by several train lines  However  the city is extremely compartmented  divided by large avenues inherited from the monarchy which create the impression of several small cities ignoring each other  Versailles was never an industrial city  even though there are a few chemical and food processing plants  Essentially  Versailles is a place of services  such as public administration  tourism  business congresses  and festivals  From 1951 until France s withdrawal from NATO unified command in 1966  nearby Rocquencourt was the site for SHAPE  Versailles is also an important military center  with several units and training schools headquartered at the Satory military base  which was the headquarters of the famed 2nd French Armored Division until 1999  and where a military exhibition is organized annually   5  Culture  Versailles  primary cultural attraction is the Palace  with its ornately decorated rooms and historic significance  The town also has other points of cultural notability  in recent times  its position as an affluent suburb of Paris has meant that it forms a part of the Paris artistic scene  and musical groups such as Phoenix  Air and Daft Punk have some link to the city  as does the director Michel Gondry   6  Population  6 1  Immigration  7  Transportation  Versailles is served by Versailles – Chantiers station  which is an interchange station on Paris RER line C  on the Transilien La Défense suburban rail line  on the Transilien Paris – Montparnasse suburban rail line  and on several national rail lines  including low frequency TGV service
