Mathematics  from Greek μάθημα máthēma  “knowledge  study  learning”  is the study of topics such as quantity  numbers   structure  space  and change  There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics   Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures  Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof  When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena  then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature  Through the use of abstraction and logic  mathematics developed from counting  calculation  measurement  and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects  Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist  The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry   Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics  most notably in Euclid s Elements  Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano  1858–1932   David Hilbert  1862–1943   and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century  it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions  Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance  when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day   Galileo Galilei  1564–1642  said   The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written  It is written in mathematical language  and the letters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word  Without these  one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth   Carl Friedrich Gauss  1777–1855  referred to mathematics as  the Queen of the Sciences   Benjamin Peirce  1809–1880  called mathematics  the science that draws necessary conclusions   David Hilbert said of mathematics   We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense  Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules  Rather  it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise   Albert Einstein  1879–1955  stated that  as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  and as far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality   French mathematician Claire Voisin states  There is creative drive in mathematics  it s all about movement trying to express itself    Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields  including natural science  engineering  medicine  finance and the social sciences  Applied mathematics  the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields  inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries  which has led to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines  such as statistics and game theory  Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics  or mathematics for its own sake  without having any application in mind  There is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics  and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered   1  History  1 1  Evolution  The evolution of mathematics might be seen as an ever increasing series of abstractions  or alternatively an expansion of subject matter  The first abstraction  which is shared by many animals  was probably that of numbers  the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges  for example  have something in common  namely quantity of their members   Evidenced by tallies found on bone  in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects  prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities  like time – days  seasons  years   More complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC  when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic  algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations  for building and construction  and for astronomy  The earliest uses of mathematics were in trading  land measurement  painting and weaving patterns and the recording of time   In Babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic  addition  subtraction  multiplication and division  first appears in the archaeological record  Numeracy pre dated writing and numeral systems have been many and diverse  with the first known written numerals created by Egyptians in Middle Kingdom texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus   Between 600 and 300 BC the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with Greek mathematics   Mathematics has since been greatly extended  and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science  to the benefit of both  Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today  According to Mikhail B  Sevryuk  in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society   The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940  the first year of operation of MR  is now more than 1 9 million  and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year  The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs    1 2  Etymology  The word mathematics comes from the Greek μάθημα  máthēma   which  in the ancient Greek language  means  that which is learnt    what one gets to know   hence also  study  and  science   and in modern Greek just  lesson   The word máthēma is derived from μανθάνω  manthano   while the modern Greek equivalent is μαθαίνω  mathaino   both of which mean  to learn   In Greece  the word for  mathematics  came to have the narrower and more technical meaning  mathematical study  even in Classical times  Its adjective is  mathēmatikós   meaning  related to learning  or  studious   which likewise further came to mean  mathematical   In particular   mathēmatikḗ tékhnē     meant  the mathematical art    In Latin  and in English until around 1700  the term mathematics more commonly meant  astrology   or sometimes  astronomy   rather than  mathematics   the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800  This has resulted in several mistranslations  a particularly notorious one is Saint Augustine s warning that Christians should beware of mathematici meaning astrologers  which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians   The apparent plural form in English  like the French plural form  and the less commonly used singular derivative    goes back to the Latin neuter plural  Cicero   based on the Greek plural  ta mathēmatiká   used by Aristotle  384–322 BC   and meaning roughly  all things mathematical   although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic al  and formed the noun mathematics anew  after the pattern of physics and metaphysics  which were inherited from the Greek  In English  the noun mathematics takes singular verb forms  It is often shortened to maths or  in English speaking North America  math   2  Definitions of mathematics  Aristotle defined mathematics as  the science of quantity   and this definition prevailed until the 18th century  Starting in the 19th century  when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry  which have no clear cut relation to quantity and measurement  mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions  Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics  some emphasize its abstractness  some emphasize certain topics within mathematics  Today  no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails  even among professionals  There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science  A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics  or consider it undefinable  Some just say   Mathematics is what mathematicians do    Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist  intuitionist  and formalist  each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought  All have severe problems  none has widespread acceptance  and no reconciliation seems possible   An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce s  the science that draws necessary conclusions   1870   In the Principia Mathematica  Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism  and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts  statements  and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms of symbolic logic  A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell s  All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic   1903    Intuitionist definitions  developing from the philosophy of mathematician L E J  Brouwer  identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena  An example of an intuitionist definition is  Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other   A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions  In particular  while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proven to exist even though they cannot be constructed  intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct   Formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them  Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as  the science of formal systems   A formal system is a set of symbols  or tokens  and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas  In formal systems  the word axiom has a special meaning  different from the ordinary meaning of  a self evident truth   In formal systems  an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system   3  Inspiration  pure and applied mathematics  and aesthetics  Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems  At first these were found in commerce  land measurement  architecture and later astronomy  today  all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians  and many problems arise within mathematics itself  For example  the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight  and today s string theory  a still developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature  continues to inspire new mathematics   Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it  and is applied to solve further problems in that area  But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas  and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts  A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics  However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications  e g  number theory in cryptography  This remarkable fact that even the  purest  mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what Eugene Wigner has called  the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics   As in most areas of study  the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization  there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46 pages  Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right  including statistics  operations research  and computer science   For those who are mathematically inclined  there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics  Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics  its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty  Simplicity and generality are valued  There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof  such as Euclid s proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers  and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation  such as the fast Fourier transform  G H  Hardy in A Mathematician s Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are  in themselves  sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics  He identified criteria such as significance  unexpectedness  inevitability  and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic  Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant  proofs from  The Book  of God according to Paul Erdős  The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions   4  Notation  language  and rigor  Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century  Before that  mathematics was written out in words  a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery  Euler  1707–1783  was responsible for many of the notations in use today  Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional  but beginners often find it daunting  It is extremely compressed  a few symbols contain a great deal of information  Like musical notation  modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax  which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline  and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way   Mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners  Words such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech  Moreover  words such as open and field have been given specialized mathematical meanings  Technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable have precise meanings in mathematics  Additionally  shorthand phrases such as iff for  if and only if  belong to mathematical jargon  There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary  mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech  Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as  rigor    Mathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor  Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning  This is to avoid mistaken  theorems   based on fallible intuitions  of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject  The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time  the Greeks expected detailed arguments  but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous  Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century  Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics  Today  mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer assisted proofs  Since large computations are hard to verify  such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous   Axioms in traditional thought were  self evident truths   but that conception is problematic  At a formal level  an axiom is just a string of symbols  which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system  It was the goal of Hilbert s program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis  but according to Gödel s incompleteness theorem every  sufficiently powerful  axiomatic system has undecidable formulas  and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible  Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be  as far as its formal content  nothing but set theory in some axiomatization  in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory   5  Fields of mathematics  Mathematics can  broadly speaking  be subdivided into the study of quantity  structure  space  and change  i e  arithmetic  algebra  geometry  and analysis   In addition to these main concerns  there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields  to logic  to set theory  foundations   to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences  applied mathematics   and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty   5 1  Foundations and philosophy  In order to clarify the foundations of mathematics  the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed  Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics  set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects  Category theory  which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them  is still in development  The phrase  crisis of foundations  describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930  Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day  The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time  including the controversy over Cantor s set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy   Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework  and studying the implications of such a framework  As such  it is home to Gödel s incompleteness theorems which  informally  imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic  if sound  meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true   is necessarily incomplete  meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system   Whatever finite collection of number theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation  Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number theoretical fact  but which does not follow from those axioms  Therefore no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory  Modern logic is divided into recursion theory  model theory  and proof theory  and is closely linked to theoretical computer science  as well as to category theory   Theoretical computer science includes computability theory  computational complexity theory  and information theory  Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer  including the most well known model – the Turing machine  Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer  some problems  although theoretically solvable by computer  are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible  even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware  A famous problem is the    problem  one of the Millennium Prize Problems  Finally  information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium  and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy                 Mathematical logic    Set theory    Category theory    Theory of computation     5 2  Pure mathematics  5 2 1  Quantity  The study of quantity starts with numbers  first the familiar natural numbers and integers   whole numbers   and arithmetical operations on them  which are characterized in arithmetic  The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory  from which come such popular results as Fermat s Last Theorem  The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach s conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory   As the number system is further developed  the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers   fractions    These  in turn  are contained within the real numbers  which are used to represent continuous quantities  Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers  These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions  Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers  which formalize the concept of  infinity   Another area of study is size  which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity  the aleph numbers  which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets                     Natural numbers   Integers    Rational numbers    Real numbers    Complex numbers     5 2 2  Structure  Many mathematical objects  such as sets of numbers and functions  exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set  Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure  for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations  Moreover  it frequently happens that different such structured sets  or structures  exhibit similar properties  which makes it possible  by a further step of abstraction  to state axioms for a class of structures  and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms  Thus one can study groups  rings  fields and other abstract systems  together such studies  for structures defined by algebraic operations  constitute the domain of abstract algebra   By its great generality  abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems  for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory  which involves field theory and group theory  Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra  which is the general study of vector spaces  whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction  and can be used to model  relations between  points in space  This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics  Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure                        Combinatorics    Number theory    Group theory    Graph theory    Order theory    Algebra     5 2 3  Space  The study of space originates with geometry – in particular  Euclidean geometry  Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions  it combines space and numbers  and encompasses the well known Pythagorean theorem  The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher dimensional geometry  non Euclidean geometries  which play a central role in general relativity  and topology  Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry  differential geometry  and algebraic geometry  Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science  Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds  in particular  vector and tensor calculus  Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations  combining the concepts of quantity and space  and also the study of topological groups  which combine structure and space  Lie groups are used to study space  structure  and change  Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th century mathematics  it includes point set topology  set theoretic topology  algebraic topology and differential topology  In particular  instances of modern day topology are metrizability theory  axiomatic set theory  homotopy theory  and Morse theory  Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture  and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture  Other results in geometry and topology  including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture  have been proved only with the help of computers                        Geometry    Trigonometry    Differential geometry    Topology    Fractal geometry    Measure theory     5 2 4  Change  Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences  and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it  Functions arise here  as a central concept describing a changing quantity  The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis  with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers  Functional analysis focuses attention on  typically infinite dimensional  spaces of functions  One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics  Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change  and these are studied as differential equations  Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems  chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior   5 3  Applied mathematics  Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science  engineering  business  and industry  Thus   applied mathematics  is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge  The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems  as a profession focused on practical problems  applied mathematics focuses on the  formulation  study  and use of mathematical models  in science  engineering  and other areas of mathematical practice   In the past  practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories  which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics  where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake  Thus  the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics   5 3 1  Statistics and other decision sciences  Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics  whose theory is formulated mathematically  especially with probability theory  Statisticians  working as part of a research project   create data that makes sense  with random sampling and with randomized experiments  the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data  before the data be available   When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies  statisticians  make sense of the data  using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection and estimation  the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data   Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk  expected loss  of a statistical action  such as using a procedure in  for example  parameter estimation  hypothesis testing  and selecting the best  In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics  a statistical decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function  like expected loss or cost  under specific constraints  For example  designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence  Because of its use of optimization  the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences  such as operations research  control theory  and mathematical economics   5 3 2  Computational mathematics  Computational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity  Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory  numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors  Numerical analysis and  more broadly  scientific computing also study non analytic topics of mathematical science  especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory  Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation   6  Mathematical awards  Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal  established in 1936 and now awarded every four years  The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize   The Wolf Prize in Mathematics  instituted in 1978  recognizes lifetime achievement  and another major international award  the Abel Prize  was introduced in 2003  The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement  These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work  which may be innovational  or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field   A famous list of 23 open problems  called  Hilbert s problems   was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert  This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians  and at least nine of the problems have now been solved  A new list of seven important problems  titled the  Millennium Prize Problems   was published in 2000  A solution to each of these problems carries a $1 million reward  and only one  the Riemann hypothesis  is duplicated in Hilbert s problems   7  Mathematics as science  Gauss referred to mathematics as  the Queen of the Sciences   In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum  as well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften  the word corresponding to science means a  field of knowledge   and this was the original meaning of  science  in English  also  mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge  The specialization restricting the meaning of  science  to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science  which contrasted  natural science  to scholasticism  the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles  The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics  compared to natural sciences such as psychology  biology  or physics  Albert Einstein stated that  as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  and as far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality   More recently  Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics  the Queen of Science     the main driving force behind scientific discovery    Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable  and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper  However  in the 1930s Gödel s incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone  and Karl Popper concluded that  most mathematical theories are  like those of physics and biology  hypothetico deductive  pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures  than it seemed even recently   Other thinkers  notably Imre Lakatos  have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself   An alternative view is that certain scientific fields  such as theoretical physics  are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality  The theoretical physicist J M  Ziman proposed that science is public knowledge  and thus includes mathematics  Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences  notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions  Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the  other  sciences  Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics  and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics   The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied  Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side  and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts  others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics  One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created  as in art  or discovered  as in science   It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics  indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide  In practice  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels  This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics   8  See also  Mathematics and art  Mathematics education  Relationship between mathematics and physics  9  Notes
