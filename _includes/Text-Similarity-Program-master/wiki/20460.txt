Film promotion is the practice of promotion specifically in the film industry  and usually occurs in coordination with the process of film distribution  Sometimes called the press junket or film junket  film promotion generally includes press releases  advertising campaigns  merchandising and media  and interviews with the key people involved with the making of the film  like actors and directors  As with all business it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk  film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle  Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget  Publicity is generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors   1  Techniques  1 1  In theaters  Trailers are a mainstay of film promotion  because they are delivered directly to movie goers  They screen in theatres before movie showings  Generally they tell the story of the movie in a highly condensed fashion compressing maximum appeal into two and half minutes   Film posters  Slideshows   stills  trivia  and trivia games from the film  shown between movie showtimes   Standees  freestanding paperboard life size images of figures from the film   Cardboard 3D displays  sometimes producing sound  1 2  Television and radio  Hollywood movie distributors spend about $4 billion a year to buy paid advertising  30 second TV commercials  newspaper ads  etc   and over half that total is placed on broadcast and cable TV  which are the main vehicles for advertising movies to audiences  TV is effective because it is an audio visual medium – like film – and can deliver a vast audience quickly  which is crucial because films typically don’t linger in theaters more than 4–6 weeks  according to Marketing to Moviegoers  Second Edition   Product placement  paid active or passive insertion  as on set posters  and action figures  of film brand in drama or sitcom shows  or as passing mentions in dialogue  For example  20th Century Fox commissioned an I  Robot themed motorcycle  featured on two episodes  2 17  2 18  of American Chopper  The film Memoirs of a Geisha was placed throughout an episode of the TV show Medium   Extended placement  full episodes of television talkshows  Oprah   entertainment news programs  ET   or network news programs  20 20   devoted to compensated exposure of the film  stars  clips  director  etc   In addition  interviews with actors and directors which are filmed en masse at a hotel with local and national entertainment reporters which are featured on local news shows  programs on cable networks  and series such as Byron Allen s series of entertainment series like Entertainment Studios   Production and paid broadcast of behind the scenes documentary style shows  the type of which are mainly produced for HBO  Showtime  and Starz  Advance trailers  longer previews  or behind the scenes footage on rental videos and DVDs  1 3  Internet  Virtual relationship hyperlink marketing  wherein a major search engine  like Yahoo s main page  offers articles seemingly presenting interesting news related items  but which are actually back end loaded with a links page containing multiple  mental references  to film characters  storylines or products  Example  Bond  Transformers  etc     are connected to scientific invention news stories about advanced weaponry or robotics discoveries  which quickly leads the reader to pages loaded with the latest 007 or Megatron movie clip or art director s fantastical ideas and designs  thus hooking readers with a  bait and switch  story   Creation of standalone studio sponsored per film websites such as  example the movie com    Online digital film screeners  These digital film screeners have the benefit of letting you send individual copies of your film or a promo to the press  sales agents  distributors etc  Using them its simple to send individually controlled copies of your film to various recipients with different expiry dates  Along with the security of individual expiry dates  you can see reports of who viewed your film and track their viewing of the film   Viral marketing  free distribution of trailers on movie oriented websites and video user generated content websites  and rapid dissemination of links to this content by email and blogs  Includes alleged leakage of supposed  rushes  and  early trailers  of film scenes  Sometimes  the efforts go further such as in the lead time to the successful premiere of the film  The Muppets which was preceded by several original film shorts on YouTube over a number of years while the film was in production   Creation of Internet Marketing campaign using Paid Advertisement and Social Media Marketing  1 4  Print  Paid advertisement in newspapers  magazines  and inserts in books   Cross promotion of original book or novelization  including special printings  or new cover jackets   Now a major motion picture     Comic special editions or special episodes  1 5  Merchandising  Paid co branding  Eragon in American Chopper two episodes   or co advertising  Aston Martin and James Bond films  of a product with the film  Promotional giveaways  branded drink cups  toys  or food combinations at fast food chains  1 6  Promotional tours and interviews  Film actors  directors  and producers appear for television  cable  radio  print and online media interviews  which can be conducted in person or remotely  During film production  these can take place on set  After the film s premiere  key personnel make appearances in major market cities or participate remotely via satellite videoconference or telephone  The purpose of interviews is to encourage journalists to publish stories about their  exclusive interviews  with the film s stars  thereby creating  marketing buzz  around the film and stimulating audience interest in watching the film   When it comes to feature films picked up by a major film studio for international distribution  promotional tours are notoriously grueling  Key cast and crew are often contracted to travel to several major cities around the world to promote the film and sit for dozens of interviews  In every interview they are supposed to stay  on message  by energetically expressing their enthusiasm for the film in a way that appears candid  fun  and fresh  even though it may be their fifth or sixth interview that day  They are expected to disclose just enough juicy  behind the scenes  information about the filmmaking process or the filmmakers  artistic vision to make each journalist feel like he or she got a nice scoop  while at the same time tactfully avoiding disclosure of anything truly negative or embarrassing   1 7  Audience research  There are seven distinct types of research conducted by film distributors in connection with domestic theatrical releases  according to  Marketing to Moviegoers  Second Edition   Such audience research can cost $1 million per film  especially when scores of TV advertisements are tested and re tested  The bulk of research is done by major studios for the roughly 170 major releases they mount each year that are supported by tens of millions of advertising buys for each film  Independent film distributors  which typically spend less than $10 million in media buys per film  don’t have the budget or breadth of advertising materials to analyze  so they spend little or nothing on pre release audience research  When audience research is conducted for domestic theatrical release  it involves these areas   Positioning studies versus other films that will premiere at the same time   Test screenings of finished or nearly finished films  this is the most well known   Testing of audience response to advertising materials   Tracking surveys of audience awareness of a film starting six weeks before premiere   Exit surveys questioning film goers about their demographic makeup and effectiveness of marketing   Title testing in an early stage   Concept testing that would occur in development phase of a film before it is produced  Marketing can play a big role in whether or not a film gets the green light  Audience research is a strong factor in determining the ability of a film to sell in theaters  which is ultimately how films make their money  As part of a movie s Marketing strategy  audience research comes into account as producers create promotional materials  These promotional materials consistently change and evolve as a direct consequence of audience research up until the film opens in theaters   2  See also  Film budgeting  Junket Whore  3  External links  MarketingMovies net  2007 present   Chicago Reader  Jonathan Rosenbaum  2002   Film Jubilee  2012   4  References
