A jury trial or trial by jury is a legal proceeding in which a jury either makes a decision or makes findings of fact  which then direct the actions of a judge  It is distinguished from a bench trial  in which a judge or panel of judges make all decisions   Jury trials are used in a significant share of serious criminal cases in almost all common law legal systems  and juries or lay judges have been incorporated into the legal systems of many civil law countries for criminal cases  Only the United States and Canada make routine use of jury trials in a wide variety of non criminal cases  Other common law legal jurisdictions use jury trials only in a very select class of cases that make up a tiny share of the overall civil docket  e g  defamation suits in England and Wales   while true civil jury trials are almost entirely absent elsewhere in the world  Some civil law jurisdictions do  however  have arbitration panels where non legally trained members decide cases in select subject matter areas relevant to the arbitration panel members  areas of expertise   The availability of a trial by jury in American jurisdictions varies  Because the United States system separated from that of the English at the time of the American Revolution  the types of proceedings that use juries depends on whether such cases were tried by jury under English common law at that time  rather than the methods used in English or UK courts in the present  For example  at the time English  courts of law  tried cases of torts or private law for monetary damages but  courts of equity  tried civil cases seeking an injunction or another form of non monetary relief  As a result  this practice continues in American civil laws  even though in modern English law only criminal proceedings and some inquests are likely to be heard by a jury   The use of jury trials evolved within common law systems rather than civil law systems  has had a profound impact on the nature of American civil procedure and criminal procedure rules  even in cases where a bench trial is actually contemplated in a particular case  In general  the availability of a jury trial if properly demanded has given rise to a system where fact finding is concentrated in a single trial rather than multiple hearings  and where appellate review of trial court decisions is greatly limited  Jury trials are of far less importance  or of no importance  in countries that do not have a common law system   1  History  1 1  Greece  Ancient Athens had a mechanism  called dikastaí  to assure that no one could select jurors for their own trial  For normal cases  the courts were made up of dikastai of up to 500 citizens  For capital cases—those that involved death  loss of liberty  exile  loss of civil rights  or seizure of property—the trial was before a jury of 1 001 to 1 501 dikastai  In such large juries  the unanimity rule would be unrealistic and verdicts were reached by majority  Juries were appointed by lot  Jurists cast a ceramic disk with an axle in its middle  the axle was either hollow or solid  Thus the way they voted was kept secret because the jurists would hold their disk by the axle by thumb and forefinger  thus hiding whether its axle was hollow or solid  Since Periclean times  jurists were compensated for their sitting in court  with the amount of one day s wages   The institution of trial by jury was ritually depicted by Aeschylus in the Eumenides  the third and final play of his Oresteia trilogy  In this play the innovation is brought about by the goddess Athena  who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury  The god Apollo takes part in the trial as the advocate for the defendant Orestes  and the Furies as prosecutors for the slain Clytaemnestra  In the event the jury is split six to six  and Athena dicates that in such a case the verdict should henceforth be for acquittal   1 2  Rome  From the beginning of the republic and in the majority of civil cases towards the end of the empire  there were tribunals with the characteristics of the jury  the Roman judges being civilian  lay and not professional  Capital trials were held in front of juries composed of hundreds or thousands of people in the commitias or centuries  the same as in Roman trials  Roman law provided for the yearly selection of judices  who would be responsible for resolving disputes by acting as jurors  with a praetor performing many of the duties of a judge  High government officials and their relatives were barred from acting as judices  due to conflicts of interest  Those previously found guilty of serious crimes  felonies  were also barred as were gladiators for hire  who likely were hired to resolve disputes through trial by combat  The law was as follows   The peregrine praetor  literally  traveling judge  within the next ten days after this law is passed by the people or plebs shall provide for the selection of 450 persons in this State who have or have had a knight s census    provided that he does not select a person who is or has been plebeian tribune  quaestor  triumvir capitalis  military tribune in any of the first four legions  or triumvir for granting and assigning lands  or who is or has been in the Senate  or who has fought or shall fight as a gladiator for hire    or who has been condemned by the judicial process and a public trial whereby he cannot be enrolled in the Senate  or who is less than thirty or more than sixty years of age  or who does not have his residence in the city of Rome or within one mile of it  or who is the father  brother  or son of any above described magistrate  or who is the father  brother  or son of a person who is or has been a member of the Senate  or who is overseas   1 3  Holy Roman Empire  A Swabian ordinance of 1562 called for the summons of jurymen     and various methods were in use in Emmendingen  Oppenau  and Oberkirch  Hauenstein s charter of 1442 secured the right to be tried in all cases by 24 fellow equals  and in Friburg the jury was composed of 30 citizens and councilors  The modern jury trial was first introduced in the Rhenish provinces in 1798  with a court consisting most commonly of 12 citizens      The system whereby citizens were tried by their peers chosen from the entire community in open court was gradually superseded by an  engine of tyranny and oppression  in Germany  in which the process of investigation was secret and life and liberty depended upon judges appointed by the state  In Constance the jury trial was suppressed by decree of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1786  The Frankfurt Constitution of the failed Revolutions of 1848 called for jury trials for  the more serious crimes and all political offenses   but was never implemented after the Frankfurt Parliament was dissolved by Württemberg dragoons  An 1873 draft on criminal procedure produced by the Prussian Ministry of Justice proposed to abolish the jury and replace it with the mixed system  causing a significant political debate  In the Weimar Republic the jury was abolished by the Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924   Between 1948 and 1950 in American occupied Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany  Bavaria returned to the jury trial as it had existed before the emergency decrees  but they were again abolished by the 1950 Unification Act    for the Federal Republic  In 1979  the United States tried the East German LOT Flight 165 hijacking suspects in the United States Court for Berlin in West Berlin  which declared the defendants had the right to a jury trial under the United States Constitution  and hence were tried by a West German jury   1 4  England and Wales  According to George Macaulay Trevelyan in A Shortened History of England  during the Viking occupation  “The Scandinavians  when not on the Viking warpath  were a litigious people and loved to get together in the ‘thing’ to hear legal argument  They had no professional lawyers  but many of their farmer warriors  like Njal  the truth teller  were learned in folk custom and in its intricate judicial procedure  A Danish town in England often had  as its main officers  twelve hereditary ‘law men ’ The Danes introduced the habit of making committees among the free men in court  which perhaps made England favorable ground for the future growth of the jury system out of a Frankish custom later introduced by the Normans ” The English king Æthelred the Unready set up an early legal system through the Wantage Code of Ethelred  one provision of which stated that the twelve leading thegns  minor nobles  of each wapentake  a small district  were required to swear that they would investigate crimes without a bias  These juries differed from the modern sort by being self informing  instead of getting information through a trial  the jurors were required to investigate the case themselves   In the 12th century  Henry II took a major step in developing the jury system  Henry II set up a system to resolve land disputes using juries  A jury of twelve free men were assigned to arbitrate in these disputes  As with the Saxon system  these men were charged with uncovering the facts of the case on their own rather than listening to arguments in court  Henry II also introduced what is now known as the  grand jury  through his Assize of Clarendon  Under the assize  a jury of free men was charged with reporting any crimes that they knew of in their hundred to a  justice in eyre   a judge who moved between hundreds on a circuit  A criminal accused by this jury was given a trial by ordeal   The Church banned participation of clergy in trial by ordeal in 1215  Without the legitimacy of religion  trial by ordeal collapsed  The juries under the assizes began deciding guilt as well as providing accusations  The same year  trial by jury became an explicit right in one of the most influential clauses of Magna Carta  signed by King John  Article 39 of the Magna Carta read   Nullus liber homo capiatur  vel imprisonetur  aut desseisetur de libero tenemento  vel libertatibus  vel liberis consuetudinibus suis  sut utlagetur  aut exuletur  aut aliquo modo destruatur  nec super eum ibimus  nec super eum mittemus  nisi per legale judicium parium suorum  vel per legem terrae  It is translated thus by Lysander Spooner in his Essay on the Trial by Jury   No free man shall be captured  and or imprisoned  or disseised of his freehold  and or of his liberties  or of his free customs  or be outlawed  or exiled  or in any way destroyed  nor will we proceed against him by force or proceed against him by arms  but by the lawful judgment of his peers  and or by the law of the land   Although it says and or by the law of the land  this in no manner can be interpreted as if it were enough to have a positive law  made by the king  to be able to proceed legally against a citizen  The law of the land was the consuetudinary law  based on the customs and consent of John’s subjects  and since they did not have Parliament in those times  this meant that neither the king nor the barons could make a law without the consent of the people  According to some sources  in the time of Edward III  by the law of the land had been substituted by due process of law  which in those times was a trial by twelve peers   The Magna Carta of 1215 further secured trial by jury by stating that  During the mid 14th Century  it was forbidden that persons who had sat on the Presenting Jury  i e   in modern parlance  the Grand Jury  to sit on the trial jury for that crime  25 Edward III stat 5   c3  1353   Medieval juries were self informing  in that individuals were chosen as jurors because they either knew the parties and the facts  or they had the duty to discover them  This spared the government the cost of fact finding  Over time  English juries became less self informing and relied more on the trial itself for information on the case  Jurors remained free to investigate cases on their own until the 17th century  The Magna Carta being forgotten after a succession of benevolent reigns  or  more probably  reigns limited by the jury and the barons  and only under the rule of laws that the juries and barons found acceptable   the kings  through the royal judges  began to extend their control over the jury and the kingdom  In David Hume s History of England  he tells something of the powers that the kings had accumulated in the times after the Magna Carta  the prerogatives of the crown and the sources of great power with which these monarchs counted   The first paragraph of the Act that abolished the Star Chamber repeats the clause on the right of a citizen to be judged by his peers  Abolition of the Star Chamber July 5  1641 An act for the regulating of the privy council  and for taking away the court commonly called the star chamber  In 1670 two Quakers charged with unlawful assembly  William Penn and William Mead  were found not guilty by a jury  The judge then fined the jury for contempt of court for returning a verdict contrary to their own findings of fact and removed them to prison until the fine was paid  Edward Bushel  a member of the jury  nonetheless refused to pay the fine  Bushel petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus  The ruling in the Bushel s Case was that a jury could not be punished simply on account of the verdict it returned   Many British colonies  including the United States  adopted the English common law system in which trial by jury is an important part  Jury trials in criminal cases were a protected right in the original United States Constitution and the Fifth  Sixth  and Seventh Amendments of the US Constitution extend the rights to trial by jury to include the right to jury trial for both criminal and civil matters and a grand jury for serious cases   2  The role of jury trials  In most common law jurisdictions  the jury is responsible for finding the facts of the case  while the judge determines the law  These  peers of the accused  are responsible for listening to a dispute  evaluating the evidence presented  deciding on the facts  and making a decision in accordance with the rules of law and their jury instructions  Typically  the jury only judges guilt or a verdict of not guilty  but the actual penalty is set by the judge  An interesting innovation was introduced in Russia in the judicial reform of Alexander II  unlike in modern jury trials  jurors decided not only whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty  but they had the third choice   Guilty  but not to be punished   since Alexander II believed that justice without morality is wrong   In France and some countries organized in the same fashion  the jury and several professional judges sit together to determine guilt first  Then  if guilt is determined  they decide the appropriate penalty  Some jurisdictions with jury trials allow the defendant to waive their right to a jury trial  this leading to a bench trial  Jury trials tend to occur only when a crime is considered serious  In some jurisdictions  such as France and Brazil  jury trials are reserved  and compulsory  for the most severe crimes and are not available for civil cases  In Brazil  for example  trials by jury are applied in cases of voluntary crimes against life  such as First and Second degree murders  forced abortion and instigation of suicide  even if only attempted  In others  such as the United Kingdom  jury trials are only available for criminal cases and very specific civil cases  defamation  malicious prosecution  civil fraud and false imprisonment   In the United States  jury trials are available in both civil and criminal cases  In Canada  an individual charged with an indictable offence may elect to be tried by a judge alone in a provincial court  by judge alone in a superior court  or by judge and jury in a superior court  summary offences cannot be tried by jury   In the United States  because jury trials tend to be high profile  the general public tends to overestimate the frequency of jury trials  Approximately 150 000 jury trials are conducted in state courts annually  and an additional 5 000 jury trials are conducted in federal courts  Two thirds of jury trials are criminal trials  while one third are civil and  other   e g   family  municipal ordinance  traffic   Nevertheless  the vast majority of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain  which removes the need for a jury trial   Some commentators contend that the guilty plea system unfairly coerces defendants into relinquishing their right to a jury trial  Others contend that there never was a golden age of jury trials  but rather that juries in the early nineteenth century  before the rise of plea bargaining  were  unwitting and reflexive  generally wasteful of public resources and  because of the absence of trained professionals  little more than slow guilty pleas themselves   and that the guilty plea system that emerged in the latter half of the nineteenth century was a superior  more cost effective method of achieving fair outcomes   3  Pros and cons  In countries where jury trials are common  juries are often seen as an important check against state power  Other common assertions about the benefits of trial by jury is that it provides a means of interjecting community norms and values into judicial proceedings and that it legitimizes the law by providing opportunities for citizens to validate criminal statutes in their application to specific trials  Alexis de Tocqueville also claimed that jury trials educate citizens about self government  Many also believe that a jury is likely to provide a more sympathetic hearing  or a fairer one  to a party who is not part of the governmentor other establishment interestthan would representatives of the state   This last point may be disputed  For example  in highly emotional cases  such as child rape  the jury may be tempted to convict based on personal feelings rather than on conviction beyond reasonable doubt  In France  former attorney  then later minister of Justice Robert Badinter  remarked about jury trials in France that they were like  riding a ship into a storm   because they are much less predictable than bench trials   Another issue with jury trials is the potential for jurors to be swayed by prejudice  including racial considerations  An infamous case was the 1992 trial in the Rodney King case in California  in which white police officers were acquitted of excessive force in the violent beating of a black man by a jury consisting mostly of whites without any black jurors   The positive belief about jury trials in the UK and the US contrasts with popular belief in many other nations  in which it is considered bizarre and risky for a person s fate to be put into the hands of untrained laymen  Consider Japan  for instance  which used to have optional jury trials for capital or other serious crimes between 1928 and 1943  The defendant could freely choose whether to have a jury or trial by judges  and the decisions of the jury were non binding  During the Tōjō regime this was suspended  arguably stemming from the popular belief that any defendant who risks his fate on the opinions of untrained laymen is almost certainly guilty  Similarly  jury trials were abolished by the government of India in 1960  this was followed by Pakistan soon afterwards  on the grounds they would be susceptible to media and public influence  One Pakistani Judge called a trial by jury  amateur justice   Malaysia abolished its jury system on 1 January 1995  citing inter alia the danger of jurors untrained in the legal profession delivering verdicts colored by emotions or popular perception  One of the last trials by jury in Malaysia was the notorious Mona Fandey case in 1994   Jury trials in multi cultural countries with a history of ethnic tensions may be problematic  and lead to juries being unduly biased and partial  This is one of the reasons why both India and Pakistan abolished jury trials soon after independence  Indeed  in these countries  a jury trial is seen as a failing of some foreign legal system rather than an advantage  this is despite the fact that both nations are common law countries   A major issue in jury trials is the secretive nature of the process  While proponents may say that secrecy allows the jury to remain impartial by protecting it from undue pressure or attention  opponents contend that this prevents there from being a transparent trial  The fact that juries do not often have to give a reason for their verdict is also criticized  since opponents argue it is unfair for a person to be deprived of life  liberty or property without being told why it is being done so  In contrast where there is a decision by a judge or judges  they are required to provide often detailed reasons of both fact and law as to why their decision was made   One issue that has been raised is the ability of a jury to fully understand statistical or scientific evidence  It has been said that the expectation of jury members as to the explanatory power of scientific evidence has been raised by television in what is known as the CSI effect  In at least one English trial the misuse or misunderstanding or misrepresentation by the prosecution of statistics has led to wrongful conviction   4  The jury trial in various jurisdictions  4 1  Australia  The Australian Constitution provides that   80  The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury  and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed  and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes    The first trials by civilian juries of 12 in the colony of New South Wales were held in 1824  following a decision of the NSW Supreme Court on 14 October 1824  The NSW Constitution Act of 1828 effectively terminated trial by jury for criminal matters  Jury trials for criminal matters revived with the passing of the Jury Trials Amending Act of 1833  NSW   2 William IV No 12    4 1 1  Challenging potential jurors  The voir dire system of examining the jury pool before selection is not permitted in Australia as it violates the privacy of jurors  Therefore  though it exists  the right to challenge for cause during jury selection cannot be employed much  Peremptory challenges are usually based on the hunches of the counsels and no reason is needed to use them  All Australian states allow for peremptory challenges in jury selection  however  the number of challenges granted to the counsels in each state are not all the same  Until 1987 New South Wales had twenty peremptory challenges for each side where the offence was murder  and eight for all other cases  In 1987 this was lowered to three peremptory challenges per side  the same amount allowed in South Australia  Eight peremptory challenges are allowed for both counsels for all offences in Queensland  Victoria  Tasmania and the Northern Territory allow for six  Western Australia allows five peremptory challenges per side  according to section 104 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2004  WA    4 1 2  Majority and unanimous verdicts in criminal trials  In Australia majority verdicts are allowed in South Australia  Victoria  Western Australia  Tasmania  the Northern Territory  New South Wales and Queensland  while the ACT require unanimous verdicts  Since 1927 South Australia has permitted majority verdicts of 11 1  and 10 1 or 9 1 where the jury has been reduced  in criminal trials if a unanimous verdict cannot be reached in four hours  They are accepted in all cases except for  guilty  verdicts where the defendant is on trial for murder or treason  Victoria has accepted majority verdicts with the same conditions since 1994  though deliberations must go on for six hours before a majority verdict can be made  Western Australia accepted majority verdicts in 1957 for all trials except where the crime is murder or has a life sentence  A 10 2 verdict is accepted  Majority verdicts of 10 2 have been allowed in Tasmania since 1936 for all cases except murder and treason if a unanimous decision has not been made within two hours  Since 1943 verdicts of “not guilty” for murder and treason have also been included  but must be discussed for six hours  The Northern Territory has allowed majority verdicts of 10 2  10 1 and 9 1 since 1963 and does not discriminate between cases whether the charge is murder or not  Deliberation must go for at least six hours before delivering a majority verdict  Majority verdicts were introduced in New South Wales in 2005  see Jury Act 1977  NSW   s 55F    4 2  Austria  Austria  in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions  retains elements of trial by jury in serious criminal cases   4 3  Belgium  Belgium  in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions  retains the trial by jury through the Court of Assize for serious criminal cases and for political crimes and for press delicts  except those based on racism or xenophobia   and for crimes of international law  such as genocide and crime against humanity   4 4  Canada  Under Canadian law  a person has the right to a jury trial for all crimes punishable by five years of imprisonment or more   4 5  France  In France  a defendant is entitled to a jury trial only when prosecuted for a felony  crime in French  that is an offence which may bring least 15 years  imprisonment  for natural persons  or a fine of €75 000  for juristic persons   The only court that tries by jury is the cour d assises  in which three professional judges sit together with six or nine jurors  Conviction requires a two thirds majority  six or eight votes    4 6  Greece  The country that originated the concept of the jury trial retains it in an unusual form  Serious crimes in Greece are tried by a panel of three professional judges and four lay jurors who decide the facts  and the appropriate penalty if they convict   4 7  Gibraltar  Being a Common Law jurisdiction  Gibraltar retains jury trial in a similar manner to that found in England and Wales  the exception being that juries consist of nine lay people  rather than twelve   4 8  Hong Kong  Hong Kong  as a former British colony has a common law legal system  Article 86 of Hong Kong s Basic Law  which came into force on 1 July 1997 following the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China provides   The principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained    Criminal trials in the High Court are by jury  The juries are generally made of seven members  who can return a verdict based on a majority of five   There are no jury trials in the District Court  which can impose a sentence of up to seven years imprisonment  This is despite the fact that all court rooms in the District Court have jury boxes  The lack of juries in the District Court has been severely criticized  Clive Grossman SC in a commentary in 2009 said conviction rates were  approaching those of North Korea    Many complex commercial cases are prosecuted in the District Court rather than before a jury in the High Court  In 2009  Lily Chiang  former chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce  lost an application to have her case transferred from the District Court to the High Court for a jury trial  Justice Wright in the Court of First Instance held that there was no absolute right to a trial by jury and that the  decision as to whether an indictable offence be tried in the Court of First Instance by a judge and jury or in the District Court by a judge alone is the prerogative of the Secretary for Justice   Ms Chiang issued a statement at the time saying  she was disappointed with the judgment because she has been deprived of a jury trial  an opportunity to be judged by her fellow citizens and the constitutional benefit protected by the Basic Law    In civil cases in the Court of First Instance jury trials are available for defamation  false imprisonment  malicious prosecution or seduction unless the court orders otherwise   A jury can return a majority verdict in a civil case   4 9  India  The first case decided by an English jury in India happened in Madras  today Chennai  in 1665  for which Ascentia Dawes  probably a British woman  was charged by a grand jury with the murder of her slave girl  and a petty jury  with six Englishmen and six Portuguese  found her not guilty  With the development of the East India Company empire in India  the jury system was implemented inside a dual system of courts  In Presidency Towns  Calcutta  Madras  Bombay   there were Crown Courts and in criminal cases juries had to judge British and European people  as a privilege  and in some cases Indian people  and in the territories outside the Presidency Towns  called  moffussil    there were Company Courts  composed with Company officials  without jury to judge most of the cases implying indigenous people   After the Crown Government of India  Raj  adopted the Indian Penal Code  1860  and the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure  1861  amended in 1872  1882  1898   the criminal jury was obligatory only in the High Courts of the Presidency Towns  elsewhere  it was optional and rarely used  According sections 274 and 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  the jury was composed from 3  for smaller offences judged in session courts  to 9  for severe offences judges in High Courts  men  and when the accused were European or American  at least half of the jurors had to be European or American men   The jury found no place in the 1950 Indian Constitution  and it was ignored in many Indian states  The Law Commission recommended its abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report  Jury trials were abolished in India by a very discrete process during the 1960s  finishing with the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure  which is still in force today   It has been argued that the 8 1 acquittal of Kawas Nanavati in K  M  Nanavati vs  State of Maharashtra  which was overturned by higher courts on the grounds that the jury was misled by the presiding judge and were susceptible to media and public influence  was the reason  A study by Elisabeth Kolsky argues that many  perverse verdicts  were delivered by white juries in trial of  European British subjects  charged with murder  assault  confinement of Indians   4 10  Ireland  In the Republic of Ireland  a common law jurisdiction  jury trials are available for criminal cases before the Circuit Court  Central Criminal Court and defamation cases  consisting of twelve jurors   Juries only decide questions of fact  they have no role in criminal sentencing in criminal cases or awarding damages in libel cases  It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict  In civil cases  a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members  In a criminal case  a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a reasonable time   Juries are selected from a jury panel  which is picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register  The principal statute regulating the selection  obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law  Miscellaneous Provisions  Act 2008  which scrapped the upper age limit of 70  Juries are not paid  nor do they receive travel expenses  They do receive lunch for the days that they are serving  however  for jurors in employment  their employer is required to pay them as if they were present at work   For certain terrorist and organised crime offences the Director of Public Prosecutions may issue a certificate that the accused be tried by the Special Criminal Court composed of three judges instead of a jury  one from the District Court  Circuit Court and High Court   4 11  Italy  The Corte d Assise is composed of 2 judges and 6 laypersons chosen at random among Italian citizens 30 to 65 years old  Only serious crimes like murder can be tried by the Corte d Assise   4 12  Japan  On May 28  2004  the Diet of Japan enacted a law requiring selected citizens to take part in criminal court trials of certain severe crimes to make decisions together with professional judges  both on guilt and on the sentence  These citizens are called saiban in  裁判員  lay judge    The saiban in system was implemented in May 2009   4 13  New Zealand  New Zealand previously required jury verdicts to be passed unanimously  but since the passing of the Criminal Procedure Bill in 2009 the Juries Act 1981 has permitted verdicts to be passed by a majority of one less than the full jury  that is an 11 1 or a 10 1 majority  under certain circumstances   4 14  Norway  Norway has a system where the lower courts  tingrett  is set with a judge and two lay judges  or in bigger cases two judges and three lay judges  All of these judges convict or acquit  and set sentences  Simple majority is required in all cases  which means that the lay judges are always in control   In the higher court appellate court  lagmannsrett  there is a jury  lagrette  of 10 members  which need a minimum of seven votes to be able to convict  The judges have no say in the jury deliberations  but jury instructions are given by the chief judge  lagmann  in each case to the jury before deliberations  The voir dire is usually set with 16 prospective jurors  which the prosecution and defense may dismiss the 6 persons they do not desire to serve on the jury   This court  lagmannsretten  is administered by a three judge panel  usually 1 lagmann and 2 lagdommere   and if 7 or more jury members want to convict  the sentence is set in a separate proceeding  consisting of the three judges and the jury foreman  lagrettens ordfører  and three other members of the jury chosen by ballot  This way the laymen are in control of both the conviction and sentencing  as simple majority is required in sentencing   The three judge panel can set aside a jury conviction or acquittal if there has been an obvious miscarriage of justice  In that event  the case is settled by three judges and four lay judges   4 15  Russia  In the judiciary of Russia  for serious crimes the accused have the option of a jury trial consisting of 12 jurors  The number of jury trials remains small  at about 600 per year  out of about 1 million trials  A juror must be 25 years old  legally competent  and without a criminal record  The 12 jurors are selected by the prosecution and defense from a list of 30 40 eligible candidates  The Constitution of Russia stipulates that  until the abolition of the death penalty  all defendants in a case that may result in a death sentence are entitled to a jury trial  Lawmakers are continuously chipping away at what types of criminal offenses merit a jury trial   They are similar to common law juries  and unlike lay judges  in that they sit separately from the judges and decide questions of fact alone while the judge determines questions of law  They must return unanimous verdicts during the first 3 hours of deliberation  but may return majority verdicts after that  with 6 jurors being enough to acquit  They may also request that the judge show leniency in sentencing   Juries have granted acquittals in 15 20% of cases  compared with less than 1% in cases decided by judges  Juries may be dismissed and skeptical juries have been dismissed on the verge of verdicts  and acquittals are frequently overturned by higher courts   Trial by jury was first introduced in the Russian Empire as a result of the Judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864  and abolished after the October Revolution in 1917  They were reintroduced in the Russian Federation in 1993  and extended to another 69 regions in 2003  Its reintroduction was opposed by the Prosecutor General   4 16  Singapore  In Singapore  the jury system was abolished in 1969  Jury trials for all had been earlier abolished in 1959  except for capital offenses with death penalty  As Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew described to the BBC and in his memoirs  due to his experiences as a trial lawyer   I had no faith in a system that allowed the superstition  ignorance  biases  and prejudices of seven jurymen to determine guilt or innocence    4 17  South Africa  The jury system was abolished in South Africa in 1969 by the Abolition of Juries Act  1969  The last jury trial to be heard was in the District of Kimberley  Some judicial experts had argued that a system of whites only juries  as was the system at that time  was inherently prejudicial to  non white  defendants  the introduction of nonracial juries would have been a political impossibility at that time   More recently it has been argued that  apart from being a racially divided country  South African society was  and still is  characterized by significant class differences and disparities of income and wealth that could make re introducing the jury system problematic  Arguments for and against the re introduction of a jury system have been discussed by South African constitutional expert Professor Pierre de Vos in the article  Do we need a jury system   On 28 March 2014  the Oscar Pistorius trial was adjourned due to the illness of one of the two assessors that assist the Judge on questions of fact  rather than law   in place of the jury  to reach a verdict  The legal system in the UK sees no reason to block extradition on this  as witnessed in the Shrien Dewani case   4 18  Sweden  In Sweden  juries are uncommon  the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges  nämndemän   However  the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court  tingsrätt  when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press  If a person is accused of e g  libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred  in a medium covered by the fundamental laws  e g  a printed paper or a radio programme   she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors  This applies also in civil  tort  cases under the fundamental laws  A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime  If it does not  the defendant is acquitted or  in a civil case  held not liable  If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed  this finding is not legally binding for the court  thus  the court  three judges  can still acquit the defendant or find her not liable  A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal  In Swedish civil process  the  English rule  applies to court costs  Earlier  a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could  when deciding on the matter of such costs  set aside the English rule  and instead use the American rule  that each party bears its own expense of litigation  This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6 2  of the European Convention on Human Rights  by the Supreme Court of Sweden  in 2012   4 19  Switzerland  As of 2008  only the code of criminal procedure of the Canton of Geneva provides for genuine jury trials  Several other cantons – Vaud  Neuchâtel  Zürich and Ticino – provide for courts composed of both professional judges and laymen  Schöffengerichte   tribunaux d échevins   Because the unified Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure  set to enter into force in 2011  does not provide for jury trials or lay judges  however  they are likely to be abolished in the near future   4 20  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom consists of three separate legal jurisdictions  but there are some features common to all of them  In particular there is seldom anything like the US voir dire system  jurors are usually just accepted without question  Controversially  in England there has been some screening in sensitive security cases  but the Scottish courts have firmly set themselves against any form of jury vetting   4 20 1  England and Wales  In England and Wales  which have the same legal system   minor criminal cases are heard without a jury in the Magistrates  Courts  Middle ranking   triable either way   offences may be tried by magistrates or the defendant may elect trial by jury in the Crown Court  Serious   indictable   offences  however  must be tried before a jury in the Crown Court  Juries sit in a few civil cases  in particular  defamation and cases involving the state  Juries also sit in coroner s courts for more contentious inquests  All criminal juries consist of 12 jurors  those in a County Court having 8 jurors and Coroner s Court juries having between 7 and 11 members  Jurors must be between 18–70 years of age  and are selected at random from the register of voters  In the past a unanimous verdict was required  This has been changed so that  if the jury fails to agree after a given period  at the discretion of the judge they may reach a verdict by a 10 2 majority  This was designed to make it more difficult for jury tampering to succeed   In 1999 the then Home Secretary Jack Straw introduced a controversial bill to limit the right to trial by jury  This became the Criminal Justice Act 2003  which sought to remove the right to trial by jury for cases involving jury tampering or complex fraud  The provision for trial without jury to circumvent jury tampering succeeded and came into force in 2007  the provision for complex fraud cases was defeated  Lord Goldsmith  the then Attorney General  then pressed forward with the Fraud  Trials Without a Jury  Bill in Parliament  which sought to abolish jury trials in major criminal fraud trials  The Bill was subject to sharp criticism from both sides of the House of Commons before passing its second Commons reading in November 2006  but was defeated in the Lords in March 2007   The first serious offence to be tried without a jury for 350 years was allowed to go ahead in 2009  Three previous trials of the defendants had been halted because of jury tampering  and the Lord Chief Justice  Lord Judge  cited cost and the additional burden on the jurors as reasons to proceed without a jury  Previously in cases where jury tampering was a concern the jurors were sometimes closeted in a hotel for the duration of the trial  However  Liberty director of policy Isabella Sankey said that  This is a dangerous precedent  The right to jury trial isn t just a hallowed principle but a practice that ensures that one class of people don t sit in judgement over another and the public have confidence in an open and representative justice system   The trial started in 2010  with the four defendants convicted on the 31st of March 2010 by Mr Justice Treacy at the Old Bailey   4 20 2  Scotland  In Scots law the jury system has some similarities with England but some important differences  in particular there are juries of 15 in criminal trials  with verdicts by simple majority   4 20 3  Northern Ireland  In Northern Ireland  the role of the jury trial is roughly similar to England and Wales  except that jury trials have been replaced in cases of alleged terrorist offences by courts where the judge sits alone  known as Diplock courts  Diplock courts are common in Northern Ireland for crimes connected to terrorism   Diplock courts were created in the 1970s during The Troubles  to phase out Operation Demetrius internments  and because of the argument that juries were intimidated  though this is disputed  The Diplock courts were shut in 2007  but between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2009  13 non jury trials were held  down from 29 in the previous year  and 300 trials per year at their peak   4 21  United States  In the United States  every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months has a constitutional right to a trial by jury  which arises in federal court from Article Three of the United States Constitution  which states in part   The Trial of all Crimes   shall be by Jury  and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed   The right was expanded with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution  which states in part   In all criminal prosecutions  the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial  by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed   Both provisions were made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment  Most states  constitutions also grant the right of trial by jury in lesser criminal matters  though most have abrogated that right in offenses punishable by fine only  The Supreme Court has ruled that if imprisonment is for six months or less  trial by jury is not required  meaning a state may choose whether or not to permit trial by jury in such cases  Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  if the defendant is entitled to a jury trial  he may waive his right to have a jury  but both the government  prosecution  and court must consent to the waiver  Several states require jury trials for all crimes   petty  or not   In the cases Apprendi v  New Jersey    and Blakely v  Washington    the Supreme Court of the United States held that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence  but any fact used to increase the defendant s sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines  This invalidated the procedure in many states and the federal courts that allowed sentencing enhancement based on  a preponderance of evidence   where enhancement could be based on the judge s findings alone  Depending upon the state  a jury must be unanimous for either a guilty or not guilty decision  A hung jury results in the defendants release  however charges against the defendant are not dropped and can be reinstated if the state so chooses   Jurors in some states are selected through voter registration and drivers  license lists  A form is sent to prospective jurors to pre qualify them by asking the recipient to answer questions about citizenship  disabilities  ability to understand the English language  and whether they have any conditions that would excuse them from being a juror  If they are deemed qualified  a summons is issued   English common law and the United States Constitution recognize the right to a jury trial to be a fundamental civil liberty or civil right that allows the accused to choose whether to be judged by judges or a jury   In America  it is understood that juries usually weigh the evidence and testimony to determine questions of fact  while judges usually rule on questions of law  although the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court case Sparf et al  v  U S  156 U S  51  1895   generally considered the pivotal case concerning the rights and powers of the jury  declared   It is our deep and settled conviction  confirmed by a re examination of the authorities that the jury  upon the general issue of guilty or not guilty in a criminal case  have the right  as well as the power  to decide  according to their own judgment and consciences  all questions  whether of law or of fact  involved in that issue   Jury determination of questions of law  sometimes called jury nullification  cannot be overturned by a judge if doing so would violate legal protections against double jeopardy  Although a judge can throw out a guilty verdict if it was not supported by the evidence  a jurist has no authority to override a verdict that favors a defendant   It was established in Bushel s Case that a judge cannot order the jury to convict  no matter how strong the evidence is  In civil cases a special verdict can be given  but in criminal cases a general verdict is rendered  because requiring a special verdict could apply pressure to the jury  and because of the jury s historic function of tempering rules of law by common sense brought to bear upon the facts of a specific case  For this reason  Justice Black and Justice Douglas indicated their disapproval of special interrogatories even in civil cases   There has been much debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the jury system  the competence or lack thereof of jurors as fact finders  and the uniformity or capriciousness of the justice they administer  The jury has been described as  an exciting and gallant experiment in the conduct of serious human affairs   As fact finders  juries are expected to fulfill the role of lie detector   A civil jury is typically made up of 6 to 12 persons  In a civil case  the role of the jury is to listen to the evidence presented at a trial  to decide whether the defendant injured the plaintiff or otherwise failed to fulfill a legal duty to the plaintiff  and to determine what the compensation or penalty should be   A criminal jury is usually made up of 12 members  though fewer may sit on cases involving lesser offenses  Criminal juries decide whether the defendant committed the crime as charged  The sentence may be set by either the jury or the judge  generally  in felony cases the jury sets punishment while in lesser offenses it may be set by the judge   Verdicts in criminal cases must be unanimous  In civil cases  the law  or the agreement of the parties  may permit a non unanimous verdict   A jury s deliberations are conducted in private  out of sight and hearing of the judge  litigants  witnesses  and others in the courtroom   Not every case is eligible for a jury trial  In the majority of US states  there is no right to a jury trial in family law actions not involving a termination of parental rights  such as divorce and custody modifications  Only eleven states allow juries in any aspect of divorce litigation  Colorado  Georgia  Illinois  Louisiana  Maine  Nevada  New York  North Carolina  Tennessee  Texas and Wisconsin   Most of these limit the right to a jury to try issues regarding grounds or entitlement for divorce only  Texas provides jury trial rights most broadly  including even the right to a jury trial on questions regarding child custody  However  anyone who is charged with a criminal offense  breach of contract or federal offence has a Constitutional right to a trial by jury   4 21 1  Civil trial procedure  In the United States  a civil action is a lawsuit  civil law is the branch of common law dealing with non criminal actions  It should not be confused with legal system of civil law   The right to trial by jury in a civil case in federal court is addressed by the Seventh Amendment  Importantly  however  the Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a right to a civil jury trial in state courts  although most state constitutions guarantee such a right   The Seventh Amendment provides   In Suits at common law  where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars  the right of trial by jury shall be preserved  and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re examined in any Court of the United States  than according to the rules of the common law   In Joseph Story s 1833 treatise Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States  he wrote    I t is a most important and valuable amendment  and places upon the high ground of constitutional right the inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in civil cases  a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases  which is conceded by all to be essential to political and civil liberty    The Seventh Amendment does not guarantee or create any right to a jury trial  rather  it preserves the right to jury trial in the federal courts that existed in 1791 at common law  In this context  common law means the legal environment the United States inherited from England  In England in 1791  civil actions were divided into actions at law and actions in equity  Actions at law had a right to a jury  actions in equity did not  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 2 says   t here is one form of action—the civil action   which abolishes the legal equity distinction  Today  in actions that would have been  at law  in 1791  there is a right to a jury  in actions that would have been  in equity  in 1791  there is no right to a jury  However  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39 c  allows a court to use one at its discretion  To determine whether the action would have been legal or equitable in 1791  one must first look at the type of action and whether such an action was considered  legal  or  equitable  at that time  Next  the relief being sought must be examined  Monetary damages alone were purely a legal remedy  and thus entitled to a jury  Non monetary remedies such as injunctions  rescission  and specific performance were all equitable remedies  and thus up to the judge s discretion  not a jury  In Beacon Theaters v  Westover    the US Supreme Court discussed the right to a jury  holding that when both equitable and legal claims are brought  the right to a jury trial still exists for the legal claim  which would be decided by a jury before the judge ruled on the equitable claim   There is not a United States constitutional right under the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial in state courts  but in practice  almost every state except Louisiana  which has a civil law legal tradition  permits jury trials in civil cases in state courts on substantially the same basis that they are allowed under the Seventh Amendment in federal court  The right to a jury trial in civil cases does not extend to the states  except when a state court is enforcing a federally created right  of which the right to trial by jury is a substantial part   The court determines the right to jury based on all claims by all parties involved  If the plaintiff brings only equitable claims but the defendant asserts counterclaims of law  the court grants a jury trial  In accordance with Beacon Theaters  the jury first determines the facts  then the judge enter judgment on the equitable claims   Following the English tradition  US juries have usually been composed of 12 jurors  and the jury s verdict has usually been required to be unanimous  However  in many jurisdictions  the number of jurors is often reduced to a lesser number  such as five or six  by legislative enactment  or by agreement of both sides  Some jurisdictions also permit a verdict to be returned despite the dissent of one  two  or three jurors   4 21 2  Waiver of jury trial  The vast majority of US criminal cases are not concluded with a jury verdict  but rather by plea bargain  Both prosecutors and defendants often have a strong interest in resolving the criminal case by negotiation resulting in a plea bargain  If the defendant waives a jury trial  a bench trial is held   In United States Federal courts  there is no absolute right to waive a jury trial  Per Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23 a   only if the prosecution and the court consent may a defendant waive a jury trial for criminal cases  However  most states give the defendant the absolute right to waive a jury trial  For civil cases  a jury trial must be demanded within a certain period of time per Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 38   5  See also
