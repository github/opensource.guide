Maxwell Herman Alexander  Max  Newman  FRS  7 February 1897 舑 22 February 1984  was a British mathematician and codebreaker  His work in World War II led to the construction of Colossus  the first operational electronic computer  and he established the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester which produced the first working stored program electronic computer in 1948  the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine   1  Education and early life  Max Newman was born Maxwell Neumann in Chelsea  London  England  on 7 February 1897  His father was Herman Alexander Neumann  originally from the German city of Bromberg  now in Poland  who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15  Herman worked as a secretary in a company  and married Sarah Ann  Pike   an English schoolteacher  in 1896   The family moved to Dulwich in 1903  and Newman attended Goodrich Road school  then City of London School from 1908  At school  he excelled in classics and in mathematics  He played chess and the piano well   Newman won a scholarship to study mathematics at St John s College  Cambridge in 1915  and in 1916 gained a first in part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos   2  World War I  His studies were postponed by World War I  His father was interned as an enemy alien after the start of the war in 1914  and upon his release he returned to Germany  In 1916  Newman changed his name by deed poll to the anglicised  Newman  and Sarah did likewise in 1920  In January 1917 Newman took up a teaching post at Archbishop Holgate s Grammar School in York  leaving in April 1918  He spent some months in the Royal Army Pay Corps  and then taught at Chigwell School for six months in 1919 before returning to Cambridge  He was called up for military service in February 1918  but claimed conscientious objection due to his beliefs and his father s country of origin  and thereby avoided any direct role in the fighting   3  Between the wars  3 1  Graduation  He resumed his interrupted studies in October 1919  and graduated in 1921 as a wrangler  equivalent to a first  in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos  and gained distinction in Schedule B  the equivalent of Part III   His dissertation considered the use of  symbolic machines  in physics  foreshadowing his later interest in computing machines   3 2  Early academic career  On 5 November 1923 he was elected a Fellow of St John s  He worked on the foundations of combinatorial topology  and proposed that a notion of equivalence be defined using only three elementary  moves   Newman s definition avoided difficulties that had arisen from previous definitions of the concept  Publishing over twenty papers established his reputation as an  expert in modern topology   Newman wrote Elements of the topology of plane sets of points  a definitive work on general topology  and still highly recommended as an undergraduate text  He also published papers on mathematical logic  and solved a special case of Hilbert s fifth problem   He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1927  where his 1935 lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics and Gödel s Theorem inspired Alan Turing to embark on his pioneering work on the Entscheidungsproblem  decision problem  using a hypothetical computing machine  In spring 1936  Newman was presented by Turing with a draft of  On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem   He realised the paper s importance and helped ensure swift publication  Newman subsequently arranged for Turing to visit Princeton where Alonzo Church was working on the same problem but using his Lambda calculus  During this period  Newman started to share Turing s dream of building a stored program computing machine   During this time at Cambridge  he developed close friendships with Patrick Blackett  Henry Whitehead and Lionel Penrose   In September 1937  Newman and his family accepted an invitation to work for six months at Princeton  At Princeton  he worked on the Poincaré Conjecture and  in his final weeks there  presented a proof  However  in July 1938  after he returned to Cambridge  Newman discovered that his proof was fatally flawed   In 1939  Newman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society   3 3  Family life  In December 1934 he married Lyn Lloyd Irvine  a writer  with Patrick Blackett as best man  They had two sons  Edward  born 1935  and William  born 1939    4  World War II  The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939  Newman s father was Jewish  which was of particular concern in the face of Nazi Germany  and Lyn  Edward and William were evacuated to America in July 1940  where they spent three years before returning to England in October 1943   After Oswald Veblen — maintaining  that every able bodied man ought to be carrying a gun or hand grenade and fight for his country  — opposed moves to bring him to Princeton  Newman remained at Cambridge and at first continued research and lecturing   4 1  Government Code & Cypher School  By spring 1942  he was considering involvement in war work  He made enquiries  After Patrick Blackett recommended him to the Director of Naval Intelligence  Newman was sounded out by Frank Adcock in connection with the Government Code & Cypher School at Bletchley Park   Newman was cautious  concerned to ensure that the work would be sufficiently interesting and useful  and there was also the possibility that his father s German nationality would rule out any involvement in top secret work  The potential issues were resolved by the summer  and he agreed to arrive at Bletchley Park on 31 August 1942  Newman was invited by F  L   Peter  Lucas to work on Enigma but decided to join Tiltman s group working on Tunny   4 2  Tunny  He was assigned to the Research Section and set to work on a German teleprinter cipher known as  Tunny   He joined the  Testery  in October  Newman enjoyed the company but disliked the work and found that it was not suited to his talents  He persuaded his superiors that Tutte s method could be mechanised  and he was assigned to develop a suitable machine in December 1942  Shortly afterwards  Edward Travis  then operational head of Bletchley Park  asked Newman to lead research into mechanised codebreaking   4 3  The Newmanry  When the war ended  Newman was presented with a silver tankard inscribed  To MHAN from the Newmanry  1943 45    4 3 1  Heath Robinson  Construction started in January 1943  and the first prototype was delivered in June 1943  It was operated in Newman s new section  termed the  Newmanry   was housed initially in Hut 11 and initially staffed by himself  Donald Michie  two engineers  and 16 Wrens  The Wrens nicknamed the machine the  Heath Robinson   after the cartoonist of the same name who drew humorous drawings of absurd mechanical devices   4 3 2  Colossus  The Robinson machines were limited in speed and reliability  Tommy Flowers of the Post Office Research Station  Dollis Hill had experience of thermionic valves and built an electronic machine  the Colossus computer which was installed in the Newmanry  This was a great success and ten were in use by the end of the war   5  Later academic career  5 1  Fielden Chair  Victoria University of Manchester  In September 1945  Newman was appointed head of the Mathematics Department and to the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester   5 1 1  Computing Machine Laboratory  Newman lost no time in establishing the renowned Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University  In February 1946  he wrote to John von Neumann  expressing his desire to build a computing machine  The Royal Society approved Newman s grant application in July 1946  Frederic Calland Williams and Thomas Kilburn  experts in electronic circuit design  were recruited from the Telecommunications Research Establishment  Kilburn and Williams built Baby  the world s first electronic stored program digital computer based on Alan Turing s ideas   After the Automatic Computing Engine suffered delays and set backs  Turing accepted Newman s offer and joined the Computer Machine Laboratory in May 1948 as Deputy Director  there being no Director   Turing joined Kilburn and Williams to work on Baby s successor  the Manchester Mark I  Collaboration between the University and Ferranti later produced the Ferranti Mark I  the first mass produced computer to go on sale   5 2  Retirement  Newman retired in 1964 to live in Comberton  near Cambridge  After Lyn s death in 1973 he married Margaret Penrose  widow of his friend Lionel Penrose   He continued to do research on combinatorial topology during a period when England was a major centre of activity notably Cambridge under the leadership of Christopher Zeeman  Newman made important contributions leading to an invitation to present his work at the 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm at the age of 65  and proved a Generalized Poincaré conjecture for topological manifolds in 1966   At the age of 85  Newman began to suffer from Alzheimer s disease  He died in Cambridge two years later   6  Honours  Fellow of the Royal Society  Elected 1939  Royal Society Sylvester Medal  Awarded 1958  London Mathematical Society  President 1949   1951  LMS De Morgan Medal  Awarded 1962  D Sc  University of Hull  Awarded 1968 The Newman Building at Manchester was named in his honour  The building housed the pure mathematicians from the Victoria University of Manchester between moving out of the Mathematics Tower in 2004 and July 2007 when the School of Mathematics moved into its new Alan Turing Building  where a lecture room is named in his honour   In 1946 Newman declined the offer of an OBE as he considered the offer derisory  Alan Turing had been awarded an OBE six months earlier and Newman felt that it was inadequate recognition of Turing s contribution to winning the war  referring to it as the  ludicrous treatment of Turing    7  References  8  Archival materials  has digital copies of materials from the library of St  John s
