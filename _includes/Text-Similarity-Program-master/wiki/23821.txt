The Prague Spring      was a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia during the era of its domination by the Soviet Union after World War II  It began on 5 January 1968  when reformist Alexander Dubček was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  and continued until 21 August when the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to halt the reforms   The Prague Spring reforms were an attempt by Dubček to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization  The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media  speech and travel  After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics  Bohemia  Moravia Silesia and Slovakia  Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two  the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic  This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring  though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989   The reforms  especially the decentralization of administrative authority  were not received well by the Soviets  who  after failed negotiations  sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country  A large wave of emigration swept the nation  A spirited non violent resistance was mounted throughout the country  involving attempted fraternization  painting over and turning street signs  on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed back out of the country after a day s wandering   defiance of various curfews  etc  While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months  and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems  see below   There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self immolation  such as that of Jan Palach   but there was no military resistance  Czechoslovakia remained controlled until 1989  when the velvet revolution ended Soviet rule peacefully  undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non violent resistance twenty years earlier  The resistance also became an iconic example of Civilian Based Defense  which  along with Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats   After the invasion  Czechoslovakia entered a period of normalization  subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  KSČ   Gustáv Husák  who replaced Dubček and also became president  reversed almost all of Dubček s reforms  The Prague Spring inspired music and literature such as the work of Václav Havel  Karel Husa  Karel Kryl  and Milan Kundera s novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being   1  Background  The process of de Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný in the late 1950s and early 1960s  but had progressed slower than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc  Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev  Novotný proclaimed the completion of socialism  and the new constitution  accordingly  adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  The pace of change  however  was sluggish  the rehabilitation of Stalinist era victims  such as those convicted in the Slánský trials  may have been considered as early as 1963  but did not take place until 1967   In the early 1960s  Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn  The Soviet model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia  Czechoslovakia was already quite industrialized before World War II and the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies  Novotný s attempt at restructuring the economy  the 1965 New Economic Model  spurred increased demand for political reform as well   1 1  1967 Writers  Congress  As the strict regime eased its rules  the Union of Czechoslovak Writers cautiously began to air discontent  and in the union s gazette  Literární noviny  members suggested that literature should be independent of Party doctrine   In June 1967  a small fraction of the Czech writer s union sympathized with radical socialists  specifically Ludvík Vaculík  Milan Kundera  Jan Procházka  Antonín Jaroslav Liehm  Pavel Kohout and Ivan Klíma   A few months later  at a party meeting  it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken  Since only a small part of the union held these beliefs  the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues  Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture  and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves   2  Dubček s rise to power  As President Antonín Novotný was losing support  Alexander Dubček  First Secretary of the regional Communist Party of Slovakia  and economist Ota Šik challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee  Novotný then invited Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev to Prague that December  seeking support  but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia s leader  Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968  On 22 March 1968  Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda  who later gave consent to the reforms   Early signs of change were few  When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  KSČ  Presidium member Josef Smrkovský was interviewed in a Rudé Právo article  entitled  What Lies Ahead   he insisted that Dubček s appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Communist Party   2 1  Literární listy  However  right after Dubček assumed power  the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became chairman of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor in chief of the previously hard line communist weekly Literární noviny  which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists  Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to freedom of the press when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union  On 4 February  in front of the entire nation  he openly criticized Novotny  exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia   Despite the official government statement that allowed for freedom of the press  this was the first trial of whether or not Dubček was serious about reforms  Goldstucker suffered no repercussions  and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media  the government  and the citizens  It was under Goldstücker that the journal s name was changed to Literární listy  and on 29 February 1968  the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor free Literarni listy  By August 1968  Literarni listy had a circulation of 300 000  making it the most published periodical in Europe   3  Socialism with a human face  On the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia’s  Victorious February   Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism  He emphasized the need to  enforce the leading role of the party more effectively  and acknowledged that  despite Klement Gottwald s urgings for better relations with society  the Party had too often made heavy handed rulings on trivial issues  Dubček declared the party s mission was  to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations     a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia  in accordance with the experience of other communist parties       In April  Dubček launched an  Action Programme  of liberalizations  which included increasing freedom of the press  freedom of speech  and freedom of movement  with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government  The programme was based on the view that  Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations  but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy   It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of the ČSSR into two equal nations  The programme also covered foreign policy  including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations  It spoke of a ten year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo   Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post war Communist regime  only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness  For instance  the immediate post war situation had required  centralist and directive administrative methods  to fight against the  remnants of the bourgeoisie   Since the  antagonistic classes  were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism  these methods were no longer necessary  Reform was needed  for the Czechoslovak economy to join the  scientific technical revolution in the world  rather than relying on Stalinist era heavy industry  labour power  and raw materials  Furthermore  since internal class conflict had been overcome  workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening Marxism Leninism  The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were  filled by capable  educated socialist expert cadres  in order to compete with capitalism   Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction  popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately  Radical elements became more vocal  anti Soviet polemics appeared in the press  after the formal abolishment of censorship on 26 June 1968   the Social Democrats began to form a separate party  and new unaffiliated political clubs were created  Party conservatives urged repressive measures  but Dubček counselled moderation and re emphasized KSČ leadership  At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April  Dubček announced a political programme of  socialism with a human face   In May  he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September  The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes  draft a federalization law  and elect a new Central Committee   Dubček s reforms guaranteed freedom of the press  and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media  At the time of the Prague Spring  Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness  and Dubček s reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies  Within the party  there were varying opinions on how this should proceed  certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly socialist  Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule   On 27 June Ludvík Vaculík  a leading author and journalist  published a manifesto titled The Two Thousand Words  It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so called  foreign  forces  Vaculík called on the people to take the initiative in implementing the reform programme  Dubček  the party Presidium  the National Front  and the cabinet denounced this manifesto   3 1  Publications and media  Dubček’s relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press  The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard line communist weekly Literarni noviny  renamed Literarni listy   Freedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakia’s past by Czechoslovakia’s people  Many of the investigations centered on the country’s history under communism  especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin period  In another television appearance  Goldstucker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged  imprisoned  or executed and thus erased from communist history  The Writer’s Union also formed a committee in April 1968  headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert  to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union  bookstores and libraries  and the literary world  Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common  soon  non party publications began appearing  such as the trade union daily Prace  Labour   This was also helped by the Journalists Union  which by March 1968 had already convinced the Central Publication Board  the government censor  to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions for foreign papers  allowing for a more international dialogue around the news   The press  the radio  and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker  Pavel Kohout  and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský  Zdenek Hejzlar  and Gustav Husak  Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held  Most importantly  this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere   4  Soviet reaction  Initial reaction within the Communist Bloc was mixed  Hungary s János Kádár was highly supportive of Dubček s appointment in January  but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček s reforms  which they feared might weaken the position of the Communist Bloc during the Cold War   At a 23 March meeting in Dresden in East Germany  leaders of the  Warsaw Five   USSR  Hungary  Poland  Bulgaria and East Germany  questioned a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms  suggesting any talk of  democratization  was a veiled critique of other policies  Władysław Gomułka and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms leveled by the Czechoslovak media  and worried the situation might be  similar to the prologue of the Hungarian counterrevolution   Some of the language in April s KSČ Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no counter revolution was planned  but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at  but not resentful of  Soviet suggestions   The Soviet leadership tried to stop  or limit  the changes in the ČSSR through a series of negotiations  The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou  near the Slovak Soviet border  At the meeting  Dubček defended the proposals of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon  The KSČ leadership  however  was divided between vigorous reformers  Josef Smrkovský  Oldřich Černík  and František Kriegel  who supported Dubček  and conservatives  Vasil Biľak  Drahomír Kolder  and Oldřich Švestka  who adopted an anti reformist stance   Brezhnev decided on compromise  The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb  anti socialist  tendencies  prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party  and control the press more effectively  The Soviets agreed to withdraw their armed forces  still in Czechoslovakia after manoeuvres that June  and permit the 9 September Party Congress   On 3 August representatives from the  Warsaw Five  and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration  The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against  bourgeois  ideology and all  anti socialist  forces  The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a  bourgeois  system—a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the capitalist class—was ever established  After the Bratislava conference  the Soviet Army left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders   4 1  Invasion  As these talks proved unsatisfactory  the Soviets began to consider a military alternative  The Soviet Union s policy of compelling the socialist governments of its satellite states to subordinate their national interests to those of the  Eastern Bloc   through military force if needed  became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine  On the night of 20–21 August 1968  Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union  the GDR  Bulgaria  Poland and Hungary—invaded the ČSSR   That night  200 000 troops and 2 000 tanks entered the country  They first occupied the Ruzyně International Airport  where air deployment of more troops was arranged  The Czechoslovak forces were confined to their barracks  which were surrounded until the threat of a counter attack was assuaged  By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied   Neither Romania nor Albania took part in the invasion  During the invasion by the Warsaw Pact armies  72 Czechs and Slovaks were killed  19 of those in Slovakia   266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured  Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist  Nevertheless  there was scattered resistance in the streets  Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow  Many small villages renamed themselves  Dubcek  or  Svoboda   thus  without navigational equipment  the invaders were often confused  Although  on the night of the invasion the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR government  the Soviet Press printed an unsigned request – allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders – for  immediate assistance  including assistance with armed forces   At the 14th KSČ Party Congress  conducted secretly  immediately following the intervention   it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention  More recent evidence suggests that conservative KSČ members  including Biľak  Švestka  Kolder  Indra  and Kapek  did send a request for intervention to the Soviets  The invasion was followed by a previously unseen wave of emigration  which was stopped shortly thereafter  An estimated 70 000 fled immediately with an eventual total of some 300 000   The Soviets attributed the invasion to the  Brezhnev Doctrine  which stated that the U S S R  had the right to intervene whenever a country in the Eastern Bloc appeared to be making a shift towards capitalism  There is still some uncertainty  however  as to what provocation  if any  occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade  The days leading up to the invasion was a rather calm period without any major events taking place in Czechoslovakia   4 2  Reactions to the invasion  In Czechoslovakia  especially in the week immediately following the invasion  popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance  On 16 January 1969  student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague s Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech  Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers  while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police   The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary  Dubček  who had been arrested on the night of 20 August was taken to Moscow for negotiations  There  he and several other leaders signed  under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians  the Moscow Protocol and it was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue   On 25 August citizens of the Soviet Union who did not approve of the invasion protested in Red Square  seven protesters opened banners with anti invasion slogans  The demonstrators were arrested and later punished  the protest was dubbed  anti Soviet    A more pronounced effect took place in Romania  where Nicolae Ceaușescu  Prime Secretary of the Romanian CP  already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and a self declared Dubček supporter  gave a public speech in Bucharest on the day of the invasion  depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms  Albania withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in opposition calling the invasion an act of  social imperialism   In Finland  a country under some Soviet political influence  the occupation caused a major scandal   Like the Italian and French Communist parties  the Communist Party of Finland denounced the occupation  Nonetheless  Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968  he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda  on 4 October 1969  The Portuguese communist secretary general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter revolutionary  along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party   Most countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion  The night of the invasion  Canada  Denmark  France  Paraguay  the United Kingdom and the United States requested a meeting of the United Nations Security Council  At the meeting  the Czechoslovak ambassador Jan Muzik denounced the invasion  Soviet ambassador Jacob Malik insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were  fraternal assistance  against  antisocial forces    The next day  several countries suggested a resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal  Eventually  a vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion  Algeria  India  and Pakistan abstained  the USSR  with veto power  and Hungary opposed  Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders   By 26 August a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Council s agenda  Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia  However  after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U S  Embassy organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U S  citizens from the country  In August 1989  she returned to Prague as U S  Ambassador  three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule   5  Aftermath  In April 1969  Dubček was replaced as first secretary by Gustáv Husák  and a period of  normalization  began  Dubček was expelled from the KSČ and given a job as a forestry official   Husák reversed Dubček s reforms  purged the party of its liberal members  and dismissed from public office professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political transformation  Husák worked to reinstate the power of the police and strengthen ties with the rest of the Communist bloc  He also sought to re centralize the economy  as a considerable amount of freedom had been granted to industries during the Prague Spring  Commentary on politics was forbidden in mainstream media  and political statements by anyone not considered to have  full political trust  were also banned  The only significant change that survived was the federalization of the country  which created the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic in 1969  In 1987  the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to Dubček s  socialism with a human face   When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and Gorbachev s own reforms  a Foreign Ministry spokesman replied   Nineteen years    Dubček lent his support to the Velvet Revolution of December 1989  After the collapse of the Communist regime that month  Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the Havel administration  He later led the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia  and spoke against the dissolution of Czechoslovakia prior to his death in November 1992   5 1  Normalization and censorship  The Warsaw Pact invasion included attacks on media establishments  such as Radio Prague and Czechoslovak Television  almost immediately after the initial tanks rolled into Prague on 21 August 1968  While both the radio station and the television station managed to hold out for at least enough time for initial broadcasts of the invasion  what the Soviets did not attack by force they attacked by reenacting party censorship  In reaction to the invasion  on 28 August 1968  all Czechoslovak publishers agreed to halt production of newspapers for the day to allow for a “day of reflection” for the editorial staffs  Writers and reporters agreed with Dubcek to support a limited reinstitution of the censorship office  as long as the institution was to only last three months  Finally  by September 1968  the Czechoslovak Communist Party plenum was held to instate the new censorship law  In the words of the Moscow approved resolution   The press  radio  and television are first of all the instruments for carrying into life the policies of the Party and state ”  While this was not yet the end of the media’s freedom after the Prague Spring  it was the beginning of the end  During November  the Presidium  under Husak  declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August  When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat  even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika  the government banned Reporter for a month  suspended Politika indefinitely  and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television   The intellectuals were stuck at a bypass  they recognized the government’s increasing normalization  but they were unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more  For example  still believing in Dubcek’s promises for reform  Milan Kundera published the article “Cesky udel”  Our Czech Destiny  in Literarni listy on 19 December  He wrote  “People who today are falling into depression and defeatism  commenting that there are not enough guarantees  that everything could end badly  that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials  that this or that could happen  are simply weak people  who can live only in illusions of certainty ”  In March 1969  however  the new Soviet backed Czechoslovakian government instituted full censorship  effectively ending the hopes that normalization would lead back to the freedoms enjoyed during the Prague Spring  A declaration was presented to the Presidium condemning the media as co conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek’s liberalization measures  Finally  on 2 April 1969  the government adopted measures “to secure peace and order” through even stricter censorship  forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the thawing of Eastern Europe for the return of a free media   Former students from Prague  including Constantine Menges  and Czech refugees from the crisis  who were able to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights  religious liberty  freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents  Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army s continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s  prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe   5 2  Cultural impact  The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with Soviet views  It contributed to the growth of Eurocommunist ideas in Western communist parties  which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union  and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups  A decade later  a period of Chinese political liberalization became known as the Beijing Spring  It also partly influenced the Croatian Spring in Yugoslavia  In a 1993 Czech survey  60% of those surveyed had a personal memory linked to the Prague Spring while another 30% were familiar with the events in another form  The demonstrations and regime changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East from December 2010 have frequently been referred to as an  Arab Spring    The event has been referenced in popular music  including the music of Karel Kryl  Luboš Fišer s Requiem  and Karel Husa s Music for Prague 1968  The Israeli song  Prague   written by Shalom Hanoch and performed by Arik Einstein at the Israel Song Festival of 1969  was a lamentation on the fate of the city after the Soviet invasion and mentions Jan Palach s Self immolation   They Can t Stop The Spring   a song by Irish journalist and songwriter John Waters  represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2007  Waters has described it as  a kind of Celtic celebration of the Eastern European revolutions and their eventual outcome   quoting Dubček s alleged comment   They may crush the flowers  but they can t stop the Spring    The Prague Spring is featured in several works of literature  Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring  It follows the repercussions of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population  A film version was released in 1988  The Liberators  by Viktor Suvorov  is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia  from the point of view of a Soviet tank commander  Rock  n  Roll  a play by award winning Czech born English playwright Tom Stoppard  references the Prague Spring  as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution  Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion  and her reflections upon these events   In film there has been an adaptation of The Unbearable Lightness of Being  and also the movie Pelíšky from director Jan Hřebejk and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský  which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies  The Czech musical film  Rebelové from Filip Renč  also depicts the events  the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration   The number 68 has become iconic in the former Czechoslovakia  Hockey player Jaromír Jágr  whose grandfather died in prison during the rebellion  wears the number because of the importance of the year in Czechoslovak history  A former publishing house based in Toronto  68 Publishers  that published books by exiled Czech and Slovak authors  took its name from the event   6  See also  Croatian Spring  Hungarian Revolution of 1956  Spring Revolutions  disambiguation   Constantine Menges  7  References  7 1
