Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol which works on the basis of  tickets  to allow nodes communicating over a non secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner  Its designers aimed it primarily at a client–server model and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other s identity  Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks   Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted third party  and optionally may use public key cryptography during certain phases of authentication  Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default   1  History and development  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena  The protocol is based on the earlier Needham–Schroeder symmetric key protocol  The protocol was named after the character Kerberos  or Cerberus  from Greek mythology  which was a monstrous three headed guard dog of Hades  Several versions of the protocol exist  versions 1–3 occurred only internally at MIT   Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman  the primary designers of Kerberos version 4  published that version in the late 1980s  although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena   Version 5  designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman  appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993  made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005   with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of version 4   Authorities in the United States classified Kerberos as auxiliary military technology and banned its export because it used the Data Encryption Standard  DES  encryption algorithm  with 56 bit keys   A non US Kerberos 4 implementation  KTH KRB developed at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden  made the system available outside the US before the US changed its cryptography export regulations  circa 2000   The Swedish implementation was based on a limited version called eBones  eBones was based on the exported MIT Bones release  stripped of both the encryption functions and the calls to them  based on version Kerberos 4 patch level 9   In 2005  the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  Kerberos working group updated specifications  Updates included   Encryption and Checksum Specifications  RFC 3961    Advanced Encryption Standard  AES  Encryption for Kerberos 5  RFC 3962    A new edition of the Kerberos V5 specification  The Kerberos Network Authentication Service  V5    RFC 4120   This version obsoletes RFC 1510  clarifies aspects of the protocol and intended use in a more detailed and clearer explanation   A new edition of the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface  GSS API  specification  The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface  GSS API  Mechanism  Version 2    RFC 4121   MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos freely available  under copyright permissions similar to those used for BSD  In 2007  MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium to foster continued development  Founding sponsors include vendors such as Oracle  Apple Inc   Google  Microsoft  Centrify Corporation and TeamF1 Inc   and academic institutions such as the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden  Stanford University  MIT  and vendors such as CyberSafe offering commercially supported versions   2  Microsoft Windows  Windows 2000 and later uses Kerberos as its default authentication method  Some Microsoft additions to the Kerberos suite of protocols are documented in RFC 3244  Microsoft Windows 2000 Kerberos Change Password and Set Password Protocols   RFC 4757 documents Microsoft s use of the RC4 cipher  While Microsoft uses the Kerberos protocol  it does not use the MIT software   Kerberos is used as preferred authentication method  In general  joining a client to a Windows domain means enabling Kerberos as default protocol for authentications from that client to services in the Windows domain and all domains with trust relationships to that domain   In contrast  when either client or server or both are not joined to a domain  or not part of the same trusted domain environment   Windows will instead use NTLM for authentication between client and server   3  UNIX and UNIX like operating systems  Many UNIX and UNIX like operating systems  including FreeBSD  Apple s Mac OS X  Red Hat Enterprise Linux  Oracle s Solaris  IBM s AIX and Z OS  HP s OpenVMS and others  include software for Kerberos authentication of users or services  Embedded implementation of the Kerberos V authentication protocol for client agents and network services running on embedded platforms is also available from companies such as TeamF1  Inc   4  Protocol  4 1  Description  The client authenticates itself to the Authentication Server  AS  which forwards the username to a key distribution center  KDC   The KDC issues a ticket granting ticket  TGT   which is time stamped  encrypts it using the user s password and returns the encrypted result to the user s workstation  This is done infrequently  typically at user logon  the TGT expires at some point  though may be transparently renewed by the user s session manager while they are logged in   When the client needs to communicate with another node   principal  in Kerberos parlance  the client sends the TGT to the ticket granting service  TGS   which usually shares the same host as the KDC  After verifying the TGT is valid and the user is permitted to access the requested service  the TGS issues a ticket and session keys  which are returned to the client  The client then sends the ticket to the service server  SS  along with its service request   The protocol is described in detail below   4 1 1  User Client based Logon  A user enters a username and password on the client machines  Other credential mechanisms like pkinit    allow for the use of public keys in place of a password   The client transforms the password into the key of a symmetric cipher  This either uses the built in key scheduling or a one way hash depending on the cipher suite used   4 1 2  Client Authentication  The client sends a cleartext message of the user ID to the AS requesting services on behalf of the user   Note  Neither the secret key nor the password is sent to the AS   The AS generates the secret key by hashing the password of the user found at the database  e g   Active Directory in Windows Server    The AS checks to see if the client is in its database  If it is  the AS sends back the following two messages to the client   Message A  Client TGS Session Key encrypted using the secret key of the client user   Message B  Ticket Granting Ticket  TGT  which includes the client ID  client network address  ticket validity period  and the client TGS session key  encrypted using the secret key of the TGS   Once the client receives messages A and B  it attempts to decrypt message A with the secret key generated from the password entered by the user  If the user entered password does not match the password in the AS database  the client s secret key will be different and thus unable to decrypt message A  With a valid password and secret key the client decrypts message A to obtain the Client TGS Session Key  This session key is used for further communications with the TGS   Note  The client cannot decrypt Message B  as it is encrypted using TGS s secret key   At this point  the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the TGS   4 1 3  Client Service Authorization  When requesting services  the client sends the following two messages to the TGS   Message C  Composed of the TGT from message B and the ID of the requested service   Message D  Authenticator  which is composed of the client ID and the timestamp   encrypted using the Client TGS Session Key   Upon receiving messages C and D  the TGS retrieves message B out of message C  It decrypts message B using the TGS secret key  This gives it the  client TGS session key   Using this key  the TGS decrypts message D  Authenticator  and sends the following two messages to the client   Message E  Client to server ticket  which includes the client ID  client network address  validity period and Client Server Session Key  encrypted using the service s secret key   Message F  Client Server Session Key encrypted with the Client TGS Session Key   4 1 4  Client Service Request  Upon receiving messages E and F from TGS  the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the SS  The client connects to the SS and sends the following two messages   Message E from the previous step  the client to server ticket  encrypted using service s secret key    Message G  a new Authenticator  which includes the client ID  timestamp and is encrypted using Client Server Session Key   The SS decrypts the ticket using its own secret key to retrieve the Client Server Session Key  Using the sessions key  SS decrypts the Authenticator and sends the following message to the client to confirm its true identity and willingness to serve the client   Message H  the timestamp found in client s Authenticator plus 1  encrypted using the Client Server Session Key   The client decrypts the confirmation using the Client Server Session Key and checks whether the timestamp is correctly updated  If so  then the client can trust the server and can start issuing service requests to the server   The server provides the requested services to the client   5  Drawbacks and limitations  Single point of failure  It requires continuous availability of a central server  When the Kerberos server is down  no one can log in  This can be mitigated by using multiple Kerberos servers and fallback authentication mechanisms   Kerberos has strict time requirements  which means the clocks of the involved hosts must be synchronized within configured limits  The tickets have a time availability period and if the host clock is not synchronized with the Kerberos server clock  the authentication will fail  The default configuration requires that clock times be no more than five minutes apart  In practice Network Time Protocol daemons are usually used to keep the host clocks synchronized  Note that some server  Microsoft implementation is one of them  may return a KRB AP ERR SKEW result containing the encrypted server time in case both clocks have an offset greater than the configured max value  In that case  the client could retry by calculating the time using the provided server time to find the offset  This behavior is documented in  ftp   ftp rfc editor org in notes rfc4430 txt RFC 4430    The administration protocol is not standardized and differs between server implementations  Password changes are described in    In case of symmetric cryptography adoption  Kerberos can work using symmetric or asymmetric  public key  cryptography   since all authentications are controlled by a centralized key distribution center  KDC   compromise of this authentication infrastructure will allow an attacker to impersonate any user   Each network service which requires a different host name will need its own set of Kerberos keys  This complicates virtual hosting and clusters   Kerberos requires user accounts  user clients and the services on the server to all have a trusted relationship to the Kerberos token server  All must be in the same Kerberos domain or in domains that have a trust relationship between each other   Kerberos cannot be used in scenarios where users want to connect to services from unknown untrusted clients as in a typical Internet or cloud computer scenario  where the authentication provider typically does not have knowledge about the users client system   The required client trust makes creating staged environments  e g   separate domains for test environment  preproduction env   production env   difficult  Either domain trust relationships need to be created that prevent a strict separation of environment domains or additional user clients need to be provided for each environments   6  Vulnerabilities  In November 2014  Microsoft released a patch  MS14 068  to rectify an exploitable vulnerability in Windows implementation of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center  KDC    The vulnerability purportedly allows users to  elevate   and abuse  their privileges  up to Domain level   7  See also  Single sign on  Identity management  SPNEGO  S Key  Secure remote password protocol  SRP   Generic Security Services Application Program Interface  GSS
