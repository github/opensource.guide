Protein Biosynthesis refers to the process whereby biological cells generate new proteins  it is balanced by the loss of cellular proteins via degradation or export  Translation  the assembly of proteins by ribosomes  is an essential part of the biosynthetic pathway  along with generation of messenger RNA  mRNA   aminoacylation of transfer RNA  tRNA   co translational transport  and post translational modification  Protein biosynthesis is strictly regulated at multiple steps  and error checking mechanisms are in place   The cistron DNA is transcribed into a variety of RNA intermediates  The last version is used as a template in synthesis of a polypeptide chain  Protein will often be synthesized directly from genes by translating mRNA  When a protein must be available on short notice or in large quantities  a protein precursor is produced  A proprotein is an inactive protein containing one or more inhibitory peptides that can be activated when the inhibitory sequence is removed by proteolysis during posttranslational modification  A preprotein is a form that contains a signal sequence  an N terminal signal peptide  that specifies its insertion into or through membranes  i e   targets them for secretion  The signal peptide is cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum  Preproproteins have both sequences  inhibitory and signal  still present   In protein synthesis  a succession of tRNA molecules charged with appropriate amino acids are brought together with an mRNA molecule and matched up by base pairing through the anti codons of the tRNA with successive codons of the mRNA  The amino acids are then linked together to extend the growing protein chain  and the tRNAs  no longer carrying amino acids  are released  This whole complex of processes is carried out by the ribosome  formed of two main chains of RNA  called ribosomal RNA  rRNA   and more than 50 different proteins  The ribosome latches onto the end of an mRNA molecule and moves along it  capturing loaded tRNA molecules and joining together their amino acids to form a new protein chain   Protein biosynthesis  although very similar  is different for prokaryotes and eukaryotes   1  Transcription  In transcription an mRNA chain is generated  with one strand of the DNA double helix in the genome as a template  This strand is called the template strand  Transcription can be divided into 3 stages  initiation  elongation  and termination  each regulated by a large number of proteins such as transcription factors and coactivators that ensure that the correct gene is transcribed   Transcription occurs in the cell nucleus  where the DNA is held  The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands  The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds  The DNA is  unzipped   disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands  by the enzyme helicase  leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied  RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3 prime  3   end to the 5 prime  5   end  while it synthesizes a single strand of messenger RNA in the 5  to 3  direction  The general RNA structure is very similar to the DNA structure  but in RNA the nucleotide uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA  The single strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores  and migrates into the cytoplasm   The first product of transcription differs in prokaryotic cells from that of eukaryotic cells  as in prokaryotic cells the product is mRNA  which needs no post transcriptional modification  whereas  in eukaryotic cells  the first product is called primary transcript  that needs post transcriptional modification  capping with 7 methyl guanosine  tailing with a poly A tail  to give hnRNA  heterophil nuclear RNA   hnRNA then undergoes splicing of introns  noncoding parts of the gene  via spliceosomes to produce the final mRNA    2  Translation  The synthesis of proteins from RNA is known as translation  Translation occurs in the cytoplasm  where the ribosomes are located  Ribosomes are made of a small and large subunit that surround the mRNA  In translation  messenger RNA  mRNA  is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide according to the rules specified by the trinucleotide genetic code  This uses an mRNA sequence as a template to guide the synthesis of a chain of amino acids that form a protein  Translation proceeds in four phases  activation  initiation  elongation  and termination  all describing the growth of the amino acid chain  or polypeptide that is the product of translation    In activation  the correct amino acid  AA  is joined to the correct transfer RNA  tRNA   While this is not  in the technical sense  a step in translation  it is required for translation to proceed  The AA is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3  OH of the tRNA by an ester bond  When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it  it is termed  charged   Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to 5  end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors  IF   other proteins that assist the process  Elongation occurs when the next aminoacyl tRNA  charged tRNA  in line binds to the ribosome along with GTP and an elongation factor  Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon  UAA  UAG  or UGA   When this happens  no tRNA can recognize it  but releasing factor can recognize nonsense codons and causes the release of the polypeptide chain  The capacity of disabling or inhibiting translation in protein biosynthesis is used by some antibiotics such as anisomycin  cycloheximide  chloramphenicol  tetracycline  streptomycin  erythromycin  puromycin  etc   3  Events following protein translation  The events following biosynthesis include post translational modification and protein folding  During and after synthesis  polypeptide chains often fold to assume  so called  native secondary and tertiary structures  This is known as protein folding   4  See also  Cistron
