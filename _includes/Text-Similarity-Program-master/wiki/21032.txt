Mohism or Moism    was a Chinese philosophy developed by the followers of Mozi  also referred to as Mo Tzu  Master Mo   Latinized as Micius   470 BC–c 391 BC  It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism  Taoism and Legalism  and was one of the four main philosophic schools during the Spring and Autumn Period  from 770 BC to 480 BC  and the Warring States period  from 479 BC to 221 BC   During that time  Mohism  墨 Mo  was seen as a major rival to Confucianism  儒 Ru   The Qin dynasty  which united China in 221 BC  adopted Legalism as the official government philosophy  The Han dynasty that followed adopted Confucianism as the official state philosophy  as did most other successive dynasties  Taoism  and later Buddhism  also played an important part in later Chinese life and thought  while Mohism all but disappeared as a separate school of thought  Mohist books were later merged into the Taoist canon  From the    A number of factors can be cited to explain Mohism s decline and disappearance  Graham is probably right  for instance  to suggest that after the Qin unification  the Mohists lost the political influence they had exerted as expert craftsmen and defense specialists who helped smaller states survive during the Warring States era  1989  p  34   But the major factor is probably that as a social and philosophical movement  Mohism gradually collapsed into irrelevance  By the middle of the former Han dynasty  the more appealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival schools  Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into Confucianism  though in a modified and unsystematic form  Key features of their political philosophy were probably shared with most other political thinkers  and their trademark opposition to warfare had been rendered effectively redundant by unification  The philosophy of language  epistemology  metaphysics  and science of the later Mohist Canons were recorded in difficult  dense texts that would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers  and that in any case quickly became corrupt   What remained as distinctively Mohist was a package of harsh  unappealing economic and cultural views  such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of music and ritual  Compared with the classical learning and rituals of the Confucians  the speculative metaphysics of Yin Yang thinkers  and the romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the Daoists  Mohism offered little to attract adherents  especially politically powerful ones    1  Beliefs  Mohism is best known for the concepts of  impartial care      This is often translated and popularized as  Universal Love   which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion  not a deficit in compassion as such  His aim was to re evaluate behavior  not emotions or attitudes   1 1  Meritocratic government  Mozi believed that the norm of handing out important government responsibilities to one s relatives regardless of capabilities  as opposed to those who were best equipped to handle these responsibilities  restricted social mobility  Mozi taught that as long as a person was qualified for a task  he should keep his position  regardless of blood relations  If an officer were incapable  even if he were a close relative of the ruler  he ought to be demoted  even if it meant poverty   A ruler should be in close proximity to talented people  treasuring talents and seeking their counsel frequently  Without discovering and understanding talents within the country  the country will be destroyed  History unfortunately saw many people who were murdered  not because of their frailties  but rather because of their strengths  A good bow is difficult to pull  but it shoots high  A good horse is difficult to ride  but it can carry weight and travel far  Talented people are difficult to manage  but they can bring respect to their rulers   Law and order was an important aspect of Mozi s philosophy  He compared the carpenter  who uses standard tools to do his work  with the ruler  who might not have any standards by which to rule at all  The carpenter is always better off when depending on his standard tools  rather than on his emotions  Ironically  as his decisions affect the fate of an entire nation  it is even more important that a ruler maintains a set of standards  and yet he has none  These standards cannot originate from man  since no man is perfect  the only standards that a ruler uses have to originate from Heaven  since only Heaven is perfect  That law of Heaven is Love   In a perfect governmental structure where the ruler loves all people benevolently  and officials are selected according to meritocracy  the people should have unity in belief and in speech  His original purpose in this teaching was to unite people and avoid sectarianism  However  in a situation of corruption and tyranny  this teaching might be misused as a tool for oppression   Should the ruler be unrighteous  seven disasters would result for that nation  These seven disasters are   Neglect of the country s defense  yet there is much lavished on the palace   When pressured by foreigners  neighbouring countries are not willing to help   The people are engaged in unconstructive work while useless fools are rewarded   Law and regulations became too heavy such that there is repressive fear and people only look after their own good   The ruler lives in a mistaken illusion of his own ability and his country s strength   Trusted people are not loyal while loyal people are not trusted   Lack of food  Ministers are not able to carry out their work  Punishment fails to bring fear and reward fails to bring happiness  A country facing these seven disasters will be destroyed easily by the enemy   Rather than standards of national wealth which are rationalized in terms of first world development  industrialization  capital and assets appreciation  trade surplus or deficit  the measure of a country s wealth in Mohism is a matter of sufficient provision and a large population  Thriftiness is believed to be key to this end  With contentment with that which suffices  men will be free from excessive labour  long term war and poverty from income gap disparity  This will enable birth rate to increase  Mozi also encourages early marriage   1 2  Morality and impartiality  Mohism promotes a philosophy of impartial caring  that is  a person should care equally for all other individuals  regardless of their actual relationship to him or her  The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought  This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools  most notably the Confucians  who believed that while love should be unconditional  it should not be indiscriminate  For example  children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers   Mozi is known for his insistence that all people are equally deserving of receiving material benefit and being protected from physical harm  In Mohism  morality is defined not by tradition and ritual  but rather by a constant moral guide that parallels utilitarianism  Tradition varies from culture to culture  and human beings need an extra traditional guide to identify which traditions are morally acceptable  The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize the general utility of all the people in that society   1 3  State consequentialism  Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism  which views pleasure as a moral good   the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are    order  material wealth  and increase in population   During Mozi s era  war and famines were common  and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society  The  material wealth  of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing  Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison  in the The Cambridge History of Ancient China  writes that the moral goods of Mohism  are interrelated  more basic wealth  then more reproduction  more people  then more production and wealth    if people have plenty  they would be good  filial  kind  and so on unproblematically   In contrast to Bentham s views  state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic  The importance of outcomes that are good for the state outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain   1 4  Society  Mozi posited that  when society functions as an organized organism  the wastes and inefficiencies found in the natural state  without organization  are reduced  He believed that conflicts are born from the absence of moral uniformity found in human cultures in the natural state  i e  the absence of the definition of what is right  是 shì  and what is wrong  非 fēi   According to Mozi  we must therefore choose leaders who will surround themselves with righteous followers  who will then create the hierarchy that harmonizes Shi Fei  In that sense  the government becomes an authoritative and automated tool  Assuming that the leaders in the social hierarchy are perfectly conformed to the ruler  who is perfectly submissive to Heaven  conformity in speech and behaviour is expected of all people  There is no freedom of speech in this model  However  the potentially repressive element is countered by compulsory communication between the subjects and their leaders  Subjects are required to report all things good or bad to their rulers  Mohism is opposed to any form of aggression  especially war between states  It is  however  permissible for a state to use force in legitimate defense   1 5  Organization  In addition to creating a school of philosophy  the Mohists formed a highly structured political organization that tried to realize the ideas they preached  This political structure consisted of a network of local units in all the major kingdoms of China at the time  made up of elements from both the scholarly and working classes  Each unit was led by a juzi  literally   chisel —an image from craft making   Within the unit  a frugal and ascetic lifestyle was enforced  Each juzi would appoint his own successor  However  there was no central authority beyond the writings of Mozi  Mohists developed the sciences of fortification and statecraft  and wrote treatises on government  ranging in topic from efficient agricultural production to the laws of inheritance  They were often hired by the many warring kingdoms as advisers to the state  In this way  they were similar to the other wandering philosophers and knights errant of the period  They were distinguished from others  however  in that they hired out their services not only for gain  but also in order to realize their own ethical ideals   1 6  Supernatural forces  Mohists believed in heaven as a divine force  天 Tian   the celestial bureaucracy and spirits which knew about the immoral acts of man and punished them  encouraging moral righteousness  Due to the vague nature of the records  there is a possibility that the Mohist scribes themselves may not have been clear about this subject  Nevertheless  they were wary of some of the more atheistic thinkers of the time  such as Han Fei  Using historical records  Mohists argued that the spirits of innocent men wrongfully murdered had appeared before to enact their vengeance  Spirits had also been recorded to have appeared to carry out other acts of justice  In fact  the rulers of the period had often ritually assigned punishments and rewards to their subjects in spiritually important places to garner the attention of these spirits and ensure that justice was done  The respect of these spirits was deemed so important that prehistoric Chinese ancestors had left their instructions on bamboo  plates and stones to ensure the continual obedience of their future descendants to the dictates of heaven  In Mozi s teachings  sacrifices of bulls and rams were mentioned during appointed times during the spring and autumn seasons  Spirits were described to be the preexisting primal spirits of nature  or the souls of humans who had died  The Mohists polemicized against elaborate funeral ceremonies and other wasteful rituals  and called for austerity in life and in governance  On the other hand  spiritual sacrifices were not deemed wasteful   1 7  Against fatalism  Mozi disagrees with the fatalistic mindset of people  accusing the mindset of bringing about poverty and sufferings  To argue against this attitude  Mozi used three criteria  San Biao  to assess the correctness of views  These were   Assessing them based on history  Assessing them based on the experiences of common  average people  Assessing their usefulness by applying them in law or politics In summary  fatalism  the belief that all outcomes are predestined or fated to occur  is an irresponsible belief espoused by those who refuse to acknowledge that their own sinfulness has caused the hardships of their lives  Prosperity or poverty are directly correlated with either virtue or sinfulness  respectively  not fate  Mozi calls fatalism a heresy which needs to be destroyed   1 8  Against ostentation  By the time of Mozi  Chinese rulers and the wealthier citizens already had the practice of extravagant burial rituals  Much wealth was buried with the dead  and ritualistic mourning could be as extreme as walking on a stick hunchback for three years in a posture of mourning  During such lengthy funerals  people are not able to attend to agriculture or care for their families  leading to poverty  Mozi spoke against such long and lavish funerals and also argued that this would even create resentment among the living   Mozi views aesthetics as nearly useless  Unlike Confucius  he holds a distinctive repulsion to any development in ritual music and the fine arts  Mozi takes some whole chapters named  Against Music  （《非乐》） to discuss this  Though he mentions that he does enjoy and recognize what is pleasant  he sees them of no utilization in terms of governing  or of the benefit of common people  Instead  since development of music involves man s power  it reduces production of food  furthermore  appreciation of music results in less time for administrative works  This overdevelopment eventually results in shortage of food  as well as anarchism  This is because manpower will be diverted from agriculture and other fundamental works towards ostentations  Civilians will eventually imitate the ruler s lusts  making the situation worse  Mozi probably advocated this idea in response to the fact that during the Warring States period  Zhou King and the landlords spent countless time in the development of delicate music while ordinary peasants could hardly meet their subsistence needs  To Mozi  bare necessities are sufficient  resources should be directed to benefit man   2  The Logicians  One of the schools of Mohism that has received some attention is the Logicians school  which was interested in resolving logical puzzles  Not much survives from the writings of this school  since problems of logic were deemed trivial by most subsequent Chinese philosophers  Historians such as Joseph Needham have seen this group as developing a precursor philosophy of science that was never fully developed  but others believe that recognizing the Logicians as proto scientists reveals too much of a modern bias   3  Mathematics  The Mohist canon of the Mo Jing described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science  and provided a small wealth of information on mathematics as well  It provided an  atomic  definition of the geometric point  stating that a line is separated into parts  and the part which has no remaining parts  i e  cannot be divided into smaller parts  and thus the extreme end of a line is a point  Much like Euclid s first and third definitions and Plato s  beginning of a line   the Mo Jing stated that  a point may stand at the end  of a line  or at its beginning like a head presentation in childbirth   As to its invisibility  there is nothing similar to it   Similar to the atomists of Democritus  the Mo Jing stated that a point is the smallest unit  and cannot be cut in half  since  nothing  cannot be halved  It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place  while providing definitions for the comparison of lengths and for parallels  along with principles of space and bounded space  It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch  The book provided definitions for circumference  diameter  and radius  along with the definition of volume   4  Siege engineers  One consequence of Mohist understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences  combined with their pacifist philosophy and skills as artisans  was that they became the pre eminent siege engineers during the period prior to the Qin unification China  capable of both reducing defenses and holding cities  They believed in aiding the defensive warfare of smaller Chinese states against the hostile offensive warfare of larger domineering states   The Mohist beliefs were outside the mainstream of Chinese thought and culture  but they were tolerated and employed for their utility as siege engineers  They were renowned in the smaller states  and the enemies of the larger states  for the inventions of siege machinery to scale or destroy walls  These included traction trebuchet catapults  eight foot high ballistas  a wheeled siege ramp with grappling hooks known as the Cloud Bridge  the protractable  folded ramp slinging forward by means of a counterweight with rope and pulley   and wheeled  hook carts  used to latch large iron hooks onto the tops of walls to pull them down   This component of Mohism is dramatized in the story of   recorded in the Mohist canon  Mozi travels 10 days and nights when he hears that Gongshu Pan has built machines for the king of Chu to use in an invasion of the smaller state of Song  Upon arriving in Chu  Mozi makes a wall out of his belt and sticks to represent machines  and shows Gongshu Pan that he can defend Song against any offensive strategy Chu might use  Mozi then announces that three hundred of his disciples are already on the walls of Song  ready to defend against Chu  The king cancels the invasion   5  Decline  With the unification of China under the Qin  China was no longer divided into various states constantly fighting each other  where previously the Mohists  proned to be an asset when putting a city under siege  or defending a city against an external threat  without wars  and in particular siege wars  there was no more need for their skills  From the    A number of factors can be cited to explain Mohism s decline and disappearance  Graham is probably right  for instance  to suggest that after the Qin unification  the Mohists lost the political influence they had exerted as as expert craftsmen and defense specialists who helped smaller states survive during the Warring States era  1989  p  34   But the major factor is probably that as a social and philosophical movement  Mohism gradually collapsed into irrelevance  By the middle of the former Han dynasty  the more appealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival schools  Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into Confucianism  though in a modified and unsystematic form  Key features of their political philosophy were probably shared with most other political thinkers  and their trademark opposition to warfare had been rendered effectively redundant by unification  The philosophy of language  epistemology  metaphysics  and science of the later Mohist Canons were recorded in difficult  dense texts that would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers  and that in any case quickly became corrupt   What remained as distinctively Mohist was a package of harsh  unappealing economic and cultural views  such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of music and ritual  Compared with the classical learning and rituals of the Confucians  the speculative metaphysics of Yin Yang thinkers  and the romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the Daoists  Mohism offered little to attract adherents  especially politically powerful ones    6  Modern perspectives  Jin Guantao  a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong  Fan Hongye  a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences  Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science  and Liu Qingfeng  a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong  have argued that without the influence of proto scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism  Chinese science lacked a definitive structure   From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties  the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak  second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty     Han studies of the Confucian classics  which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science  were declining  If Mohism  rich in scientific thought  had rapidly grown and strengthened  the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure  However  this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed  During the late Eastern Han  disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation  leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history  One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science   7  See also  Agape  Ascetism
