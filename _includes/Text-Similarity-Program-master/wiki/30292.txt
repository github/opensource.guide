The Hobbit  or There and Back Again is a fantasy novel and children s book by English author J  R  R  Tolkien  It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim  being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction  The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children s literature   Set in a time  Between the Dawn of Færie and the Dominion of Men   The Hobbit follows the quest of home loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon  Smaug  Bilbo s journey takes him from light hearted  rural surroundings into more sinister territory  The story is told in the form of an episodic quest  and most chapters introduce a specific creature  or type of creature  of Tolkien s Wilderland  By accepting the disreputable  romantic  fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense  Bilbo gains a new level of maturity  competence and wisdom  The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies  where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re emerge to engage in conflict   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story  Along with motifs of warfare  these themes have led critics to view Tolkien s own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story  The author s scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences   Encouraged by the book s critical and financial success  the publisher requested a sequel  As Tolkien s work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed  he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit  These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition  Further editions followed with minor emendations  including those reflecting Tolkien s changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled  The work has never been out of print  Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage  screen  radio  board games and video games  Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits   1  Characters  Bilbo Baggins  the titular protagonist  is a respectable  reserved hobbit  During his adventure  Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food  Until he finds a magic ring  he is more baggage than help  Gandalf  an itinerant wizard introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves  During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at  only to appear again at key moments in the story  Thorin Oakenshield  the proud  pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain  makes many mistakes in his leadership  relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble  but he proves himself a mighty warrior  Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin s grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance  such as the twelve other dwarves of the company  two types of elves  both puckish and more serious warrior types  Men  man eating trolls  boulder throwing giants  evil cave dwelling goblins  forest dwelling giant spiders who can speak  immense and heroic eagles who also speak  evil wolves  or wargs  who are allied with the goblins  Elrond the sage  Gollum  a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake  Beorn  a man who can assume bear form  and Bard the Bowman  a grim but honourable archer of Lake town   2  Plot  Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves  who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug  When the music ends  Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition s  burglar   The dwarves ridicule the idea  but Bilbo  indignant  joins despite himself   The group travels into the wild  where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell  where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map  Passing over the Misty Mountains  they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground  Although Gandalf rescues them  Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins  Lost in the goblin tunnels  he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum  who engages him in a game of riddles  As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels  but if Bilbo fails  his life will be forfeit  With the help of the ring  which confers invisibility  Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves  improving his reputation with them  The goblins and Wargs give chase but the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of Beorn   The company enters the black forest of Mirkwood without Gandalf  In Mirkwood  Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the Wood elves  Nearing the Lonely Mountain  the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake town  who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug s demise  The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door  Bilbo scouts the dragon s lair  stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug s armour  The enraged dragon  deducing that Lake town has aided the intruder  sets out to destroy the town  A noble thrush had overheard Bilbo s report of Smaug s vulnerability and reports it to the Lake town defender  Bard  who slays the dragon   When the dwarves take possession of the mountain  Bilbo finds the Arkenstone  an heirloom of Thorin s dynasty  and hides it away  The Wood elves and Lake men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid  reparations for Lake town s destruction  and settlement of old claims on the treasure  Thorin refuses and  having summoned his kin from the mountains of the North  reinforces his position  Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war  but Thorin is intransigent  He banishes Bilbo  and battle seems inevitable   Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs  The dwarves  men and elves band together  but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies  Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies  Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure  having no want or need for more  but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit   3  Concept and creation  3 1  Background  In the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo Saxon  with a fellowship at Pembroke College  Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections  including Goblin Feet and The Cat and the Fiddle  A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked  a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle  His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins  and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology  which he had been creating since 1917  These works all saw posthumous publication   In a 1955 letter to W  H  Auden  Tolkien recollects that he began work on The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s  when he was marking School Certificate papers  He found a blank page  Suddenly inspired  he wrote the words   In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit   By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends  including C  S  Lewis and a student of Tolkien s named Elaine Griffiths  In 1936  when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall  a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin  she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien  In any event  Dagnall was impressed by it  and showed the book to Stanley Unwin  who then asked his 10 year old son Rayner to review it  Rayner s favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin s decision to publish Tolkien s book   3 2  Influences  One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th century Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris  Tolkien wished to imitate Morris s prose and poetry romances  following the general style and approach of the work  The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape  has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris  Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett s historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain  Gilles de Retz  Incidents in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar in narrative and style to the novel  and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien   Tolkien s portrayal of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by George MacDonald s The Princess and the Goblin  However  MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes  his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith   Tolkien scholar Mark T  Hooker has cataloged a lengthy series of parallels between The Hobbit and Jules Verne s Journey to the Center of the Earth  These include  among other things  a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment that direct the adventurers to the goals of their quests   Tolkien s works incorporate much influence from Norse mythology reflecting his lifelong passion for those stories and his academic career in Germanic philology  The Hobbit is no exception to this  the work shows influences from northern European literature  myths and languages and the strong influence of Norse mythology  especially from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda  Examples include the names of some characters  such as Fili  Kili  Oin  Gloin  Bifur  Bofur  Bombur  Dori  Nori  Dwalin  Balin  Dain  Nain  Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf  deriving from the Old Norse names Fíli  Kíli  Oin  Glói  Bivör  Bávörr  Bömburr  Dori  Nóri  Dvalinn  Bláin  Dain  Nain  Þorin Eikinskialdi and Gandálfr   But whilst their names are from Old Norse  the characters of the dwarves are more directly taken from fairy tales such as Snow White and Snow White and Rose Red as collected by the Brothers Grimm  The latter of these tales may have also influenced the character of Beorn   Tolkien s use of descriptive personal and place names such as Misty Mountains and Bag End echoes the descriptive names used in Old Norse sagas  The names of the dwarf friendly ravens are also derived from Old Norse for  raven  and  rook   but their characters are unlike the typical war carrion from Old Norse and Old English literature  Tolkien  however  is not simply skimming historical sources for effect  linguistic styles  especially the relationship between the modern and ancient  has been seen to be one of the major themes explored by the story  Another characteristic of The Hobbit found in Old Norse sagas is maps accompanying the text of the story  Several of the author s illustrations  including the dwarven map  the frontispiece and the dust jacket  make use of Anglo Saxon runes  an English extension of the Germanic runic alphabets   Themes found in Old English literature  and specifically in the poem Beowulf  have a heavy presence in defining the ancient world Bilbo stepped into  Tolkien  an accomplished Beowulf scholar  claims the poem to be among his  most valued sources  in writing The Hobbit  Tolkien is credited with being the first critic to expound on Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond merely historical  and his 1936 lecture Beowulf  the Monsters and the Critics is still required in some Old English courses  The Beowulf poem contains several elements that Tolkien borrowed for The Hobbit  including a monstrous  intelligent dragon  Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor rewording  such as when each dragon stretches out its neck to sniff for intruders  Likewise  Tolkien s descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf  Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug  and Smaug s personality which leads to the destruction of Lake town  Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described  such as details about the cup thief and the dragon s intellect and personality   Another influence from Old English sources is the appearance of named blades of renown  adorned in runes  It is in the use of his elf blade that we see Bilbo finally taking his first independent heroic action  By his naming the blade  Sting  we see Bilbo s acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf  signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself  This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon s hoard  rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf  and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns  As Tolkien wrote   The episode of the theft arose naturally  and almost inevitably  from the circumstances  It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point  I fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same    The name of the wizard Radagast is widely recognized to be taken from the name of the Slavic deity Rodegast   The representation of the dwarves in The Hobbit was influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding the Jewish people and their history  The dwarves  characteristics of being dispossessed of their ancient homeland at the Lonely Mountain  and living among other groups whilst retaining their own culture are all derived from the medieval image of Jews  whilst their warlike nature stems from accounts in the Hebrew Bible  The Dwarven calendar invented for The Hobbit reflects the Jewish calendar in beginning in late autumn  And although Tolkien denied allegory  the dwarves taking Bilbo out of his complacent existence has been seen as an eloquent metaphor for the  impoverishment of Western society without Jews    3 3  Publication  George Allen & Unwin Ltd  of London published the first edition of The Hobbit on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1 500 copies  which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews  This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien  who designed the dust jacket as well  Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York reset type for an American edition  to be released early in 1938  in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates  Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing  released at the end of 1937  Despite the book s popularity  paper rationing brought on by wartime conditions and not ending until 1949 meant that the Allen & Unwin edition of the book was often unavailable during this period   Subsequent editions in English were published in 1951  1966  1978 and 1995  The novel has been reprinted frequently by many publishers  In addition  The Hobbit has been translated into over forty languages  with more than one published version for some languages   3 3 1  Revisions  In December 1937  The Hobbit publisher  Stanley Unwin  asked Tolkien for a sequel  In response Tolkien provided drafts for The Silmarillion  but the editors rejected them  believing that the public wanted  more about hobbits   Tolkien subsequently began work on The New Hobbit  which would eventually become The Lord of the Rings  a course that would not only change the context of the original story  but lead to substantial changes to the character of Gollum   In the first edition of The Hobbit  Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle game  and he and Bilbo part amicably  In the second edition edits  to reflect the new concept of the ring and its corrupting abilities  Tolkien made Gollum more aggressive towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring  The encounter ends with Gollum s curse   Thief  Thief  Thief  Baggins  We hates it  we hates it  we hates it forever   This presages Gollum s portrayal in The Lord of the Rings   Tolkien sent this revised version of the chapter  Riddles in the Dark  to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity with The Lord of the Rings  but he heard nothing back for years  When he was sent galley proofs of a new edition  Tolkien was surprised to find the sample text had been incorporated  In The Lord of the Rings  the original version of the riddle game is explained as a  lie  made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring  whereas the revised version contains the  true  account  The revised text became the second edition  published in 1951 in both the UK and the US   Tolkien began a new version in 1960  attempting to adjust the tone of The Hobbit to its sequel  He abandoned the new revision at chapter three after he received criticism that it  just wasn t The Hobbit   implying it had lost much of its light hearted tone and quick pace   After an unauthorized paperback edition of The Lord of the Rings appeared from Ace Books in 1965  Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine asked Tolkien to refresh the text of The Hobbit to renew the US copyright  This text became the 1966 third edition  Tolkien took the opportunity to align the narrative even more closely to The Lord of the Rings and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished Quenta Silmarillion as it stood at that time  These small edits included  for example  changing the phrase  elves that are now called Gnomes  from the first and second editions on page 63  to  High Elves of the West  my kin  in the third edition  Tolkien had used  gnome  in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves—the Noldor  or  Deep Elves  —thinking  gnome   derived from the Greek gnosis  knowledge   was a good name for the wisest of the elves  However  because of its common denotation of a garden gnome  derived from the 16th century Paracelsus  Tolkien abandoned the term   3 3 2  Posthumous editions  Since the author s death  two editions of The Hobbit have been published with commentary on the creation  emendation and development of the text  In The Annotated Hobbit Douglas Anderson provides the entire text of the published book  alongside commentary and illustrations  Later editions added the text of The Quest of Erebor  Anderson s commentary shows many of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text  and chronicles in detail the changes Tolkien made to the various published editions  Alongside the annotations  the text is illustrated by pictures from many of the translated editions  including images by Tove Jansson  The edition also presents a number of little known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkien s poem  Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden    With The History of The Hobbit  published in two parts in 2007  John Rateliff provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book  alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien s scholarly and creative works  both contemporary and later  Rateliff moreover provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien  The book keeps Rateliff s commentary separate from Tolkien s text  allowing the reader to read the original drafts as contained stories   3 4  Illustration and design  Tolkien s correspondence and publisher s records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book  All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien  Rayner Unwin  in his publishing memoir  comments   In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin    detailed  fluent  often pungent  but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise    I doubt any author today  however famous  would get such scrupulous attention    Even the maps  of which Tolkien originally proposed five  were considered and debated  He wished Thror s map to be tipped in  that is  glued in after the book has been bound  at first mention in the text  and with the moon letters  Anglo Saxon runes  on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light  In the end the cost  as well as the shading of the maps  which would be difficult to reproduce  resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers  Thror s map  and the Map of the Wilderland  both printed in black and red on the paper s cream background   Originally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps  but Tolkien s first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher s staff that they opted to include them without raising the book s price despite the extra cost  Thus encouraged  Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations  The publisher accepted all of these as well  giving the first edition ten black and white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps  The illustrated scenes were  The Hill  Hobbiton across the Water  The Trolls  The Mountain Path  The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate  Beorn s Hall  Mirkwood  The Elvenking s Gate  Lake Town  The Front Gate  and The Hall at Bag End  All but one of the illustrations were a full page  and one  the Mirkwood illustration  required a separate plate   Satisfied with his skills  the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket  This project  too  became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence  with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw  The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English  giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher  The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours  but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time  His final design consisted of four colours  The publishers  mindful of the cost  removed the red from the sun to end up with only black  blue  and green ink on white stock   The publisher s production staff designed a binding  but Tolkien objected to several elements  Through several iterations  the final design ended up as mostly the author s  The spine shows Anglo Saxon runes  two  þ   Thráin and Thrór  and one  D   Door   The front and back covers were mirror images of each other  with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien s style stamped along the lower edge  and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge   Once illustrations were approved for the book  Tolkien proposed colour plates as well  The publisher would not relent on this  so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later  Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece  The Hill  Hobbiton across the Water  in colour and the addition of new colour plates  Rivendell  Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes  Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft elves and a Conversation with Smaug  which features a dwarvish curse written in Tolkien s invented script Tengwar  and signed with two  þ    Th   runes  The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing  with exception of Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes   Different editions have been illustrated in diverse ways  Many follow the original scheme at least loosely  but many others are illustrated by other artists  especially the many translated editions  Some cheaper editions  particularly paperback  are not illustrated except with the maps   The Children s Book Club  edition of 1942 includes the black and white pictures but no maps  an anomaly   Tolkien s use of runes  both as decorative devices and as magical signs within the story  has been cited as a major cause for the popularization of runes within  New Age  and esoteric literature  stemming from Tolkien s popularity with the elements of counter culture in the 1970s   4  Genre  The Hobbit takes cues from narrative models of children s literature  as shown by its omniscient narrator and characters that young children can relate to  such as the small  food obsessed  and morally ambiguous Bilbo  The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes  safe  from  dangerous  in its geography  Both are key elements of works intended for children  as is the  home away home   or there and back again  plot structure typical of the Bildungsroman  While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly  the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel  Emer O Sullivan  in her Comparative Children s Literature  notes The Hobbit as one of a handful of children s books that has been accepted into mainstream literature  alongside Jostein Gaarder s Sophie s World  1991  and J  K  Rowling s Harry Potter series  1997–2007    Tolkien intended The Hobbit as a  fairy story  and wrote it in a tone suited to addressing children although he said later that the book was not specifically written for children but had rather been created out of his interest in mythology and legend  Many of the initial reviews refer to the work as a fairy story  However  according to Jack Zipes writing in  The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales   Bilbo is an atypical character for a fairy tale  The work is much longer than Tolkien s ideal proposed in his essay On Fairy Stories  Many fairy tale motifs  such as the repetition of similar events seen in the dwarves  arrival at Bilbo s and Beorn s homes  and folklore themes  such as trolls turning to stone  are to be found in the story   The book is popularly called  and often marketed as  a fantasy novel  but like Peter Pan and Wendy by J  M  Barrie and The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald  both of which influenced Tolkien and contain fantasy elements  it is primarily identified as being children s literature  The two genres are not mutually exclusive  so some definitions of high fantasy include works for children by authors such as L  Frank Baum and Lloyd Alexander alongside the works of Gene Wolfe and Jonathan Swift  which are more often considered adult literature  The Hobbit has been called  the most popular of all twentieth century fantasies written for children   Chance  however  considers the book to be a children s novel only in the sense that it appeals to the child in an adult reader  Sullivan credits the first publication of The Hobbit as an important step in the development of high fantasy  and further credits the 1960s paperback debuts of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as essential to the creation of a mass market for fiction of this kind as well the fantasy genre s current status   5  Style  Tolkien s prose is unpretentious and straightforward  taking as given the existence of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter of fact way  while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner  This down to earth style  also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams  Watership Down and Peter Beagle s The Last Unicorn  accepts readers into the fictional world  rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality  While The Hobbit is written in a simple  friendly language  each of its characters has a unique voice  The narrator  who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides  a device common to both children s and Anglo Saxon literature   has his own linguistic style separate from those of the main characters   The basic form of the story is that of a quest  told in episodes  For the most part of the book  each chapter introduces a different denizen of the Wilderland  some helpful and friendly towards the protagonists  and others threatening or dangerous  However the general tone is kept light hearted  being interspersed with songs and humour  One example of the use of song to maintain tone is when Thorin and Company are kidnapped by goblins  who  when marching them into the underworld  sing   Clap  Snap  the black crack  Grip  grab  Pinch  nab  And down down to Goblin town You go  my lad  This onomatopoeic singing undercuts the dangerous scene with a sense of humour  Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well  as seen in the foolishness and Cockney dialect of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors  The general form—that of a journey into strange lands  told in a light hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model of The Icelandic Journals by William Morris  an important literary influence on Tolkien   6  Critical analysis  6 1  Themes  The evolution and maturation of the protagonist  Bilbo Baggins  is central to the story  This journey of maturation  where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world  may be seen as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest  The Jungian concept of individuation is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability  with the author contrasting Bilbo s personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves  Thus  while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on  it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party  a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge  The analogue of the  underworld  and the hero returning from it with a boon  such as the ring  or Elvish blades  that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic archetypes regarding initiation and male coming of age as described by Joseph Campbell  Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the Ancrene Wisse  which Tolkien had written on in 1929  and a Christian understanding of Beowulf   The overcoming of greed and selfishness has been seen as the central moral of the story  Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel  with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters  simple desire for food  be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood elf fare  or a desire for beautiful objects  such as gold and jewels  it is only by the Arkenstone s influence upon Thorin that greed  and its attendant vices  coveting  and  malignancy   come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale  Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace  However  Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor  disregarding all the promises and  at your services  he had previously bestowed  In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need  Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion  and there are connections between the words  Arkenstone  and  Silmaril  in Tolkien s invented etymologies   The Hobbit employs themes of animism  An important concept in anthropology and child development  animism is the idea that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events  such as storms or purses  as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human like intelligence  John D  Rateliff calls this the  Doctor Dolittle Theme  in The History of the Hobbit  and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme  These talking creatures include ravens  a thrush  spiders and the dragon Smaug  alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves  Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien s other works  and mentions the  roots of mountains  and  feet of trees  in The Hobbit as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate  Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth      The first men to talk of  trees and stars  saw things very differently  To them  the world was alive with mythological beings    To them the whole of creation was  myth woven and elf patterned     6 2  Interpretation  As in plot and setting  Tolkien brings his literary theories to bear in forming characters and their interactions  He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world  Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds  For example  Gollum s riddles are taken from old historical sources  while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books  It is the form of the riddle game  familiar to both  which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other  rather than the content of the riddles themselves  This idea of a superficial contrast between characters  individual linguistic style  tone and sphere of interest  leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern  is a recurring theme in The Hobbit   Smaug is the main antagonist  In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of Beowulf  and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence  Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure  such as in the legend of St  George  Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of Pandæmonium with its  Belched fire and rolling smoke  in Milton s Paradise Lost  Of all the characters  Smaug s speech is the most modern  using idioms such as  Don t let your imagination run away with you    Just as Tolkien s literary theories have been seen to influence the tale  so have Tolkien s experiences  The Hobbit may be read as Tolkien s parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile  The tale as such explores the theme of heroism  As Janet Croft notes  Tolkien s literary reaction to war at this time differed from most post war writers by eschewing irony as a method for distancing events and instead using mythology to mediate his experiences  Similarities to the works of other writers who faced the Great War are seen in The Hobbit  including portraying warfare as anti pastoral  in  The Desolation of Smaug   both the area under the influence of Smaug before his demise and the setting for The Battle of the Five Armies later are described as barren  damaged landscapes  The Hobbit makes a warning against repeating the tragedies of World War I  and Tolkien s attitude as a veteran may well be summed up by Bilbo s comment   Victory after all  I suppose  Well  it seems a very gloomy business    7  Reception  On first publication in October 1937  The Hobbit was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in the UK and the US  including The Times  Catholic World and The New York Post  C  S  Lewis  friend of Tolkien  and later author of The Chronicles of Narnia between 1949–1954   writing in The Times reports   The truth is that in this book a number of good things  never before united  have come together  a fund of humour  an understanding of children  and a happy fusion of the scholar s with the poet s grasp of mythology    The professor has the air of inventing nothing  He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib  originality   Lewis compares the book to Alice in Wonderland in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it  and places it alongside Flatland  Phantastes  and The Wind in the Willows  W  H  Auden  in his review of the sequel The Fellowship of the Ring calls The Hobbit  one of the best children s stories of this century   Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien  and they became friends  The Hobbit was nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction of the year  1938   More recently  the book has been recognized as  Most Important 20th Century Novel  for Older Readers   in the Children s Books of the Century poll in Books for Keeps   Publication of the sequel The Lord of the Rings altered many critics  reception of the work  Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a children s book in its own right  critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of The Hobbit as being a  prelude   relegating the story to a dry run for the later work  Countering a presentist interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original s value as a children s book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right  and that it disregards the book s influence on these genres  Commentators such as Paul Kocher  John D  Rateliff and C  W  Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately  both because The Hobbit was conceived  published  and received independently of the later work  and also to prevent the reader from having false expectations of tone and style dashed   8  Legacy  8 1  The Lord of the Rings  While The Hobbit has been adapted and elaborated upon in many ways  its sequel The Lord of the Rings is often claimed to be its greatest legacy  The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence  the stories begin at Bag End  the home of Bilbo Baggins  Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel s main plot into motion  Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward  Elrond offers a haven and advice  the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground  Goblin Town Moria   they engage another group of elves  The Elvenking’s realm Lothlórien   they traverse a desolate region  Desolation of Smaug the Dead Marshes   they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men  Lake town Ithilien   they fight in a massive battle  The Battle of Five Armies Battle of Pelennor Fields   their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak  Lonely Mountain Mount Doom   a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne  Bard Aragorn   and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition  having possessions auctioned off the scouring of the Shire    The Lord of the Rings contains several more supporting scenes  and has a more sophisticated plot structure  following the paths of multiple characters  Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes  The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers  expecting them to be similar  find that they are not  Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children  and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience  who had subsequently grown up since its publication  Further  Tolkien s concept of Middle earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings   8 2  In education  The style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers  literacy skills  preparing them to approach the works of Dickens and Shakespeare  By contrast  offering advanced younger readers modern teenage oriented fiction may not exercise their reading skills  while the material may contain themes more suited to adolescents  As one of several books that have been recommended for 11–14 year old boys to encourage literacy in that demographic  The Hobbit is promoted as  the original and still the best fantasy ever written    Several teaching guides and books of study notes have been published to help teachers and students gain the most from the book  The Hobbit introduces literary concepts  notably allegory  to young readers  as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting the life and times of the author  Meanwhile the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work  This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations  to tenets of New Criticism  and critical tools from Freudian analysis  such as sublimation  in approaching literary works   Another approach to critique taken in the classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist  While Bilbo may be seen as a literary symbol of small folk of any gender  a gender conscious approach can help students establish notions of a  socially symbolic text  where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work  By this interpretation  it is ironic that the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls  school   8 3  Adaptations  The first authorized adaptation of The Hobbit appeared in March 1953  a stage production by St  Margaret s School  Edinburgh  The Hobbit has since been adapted for other media many times   The first
