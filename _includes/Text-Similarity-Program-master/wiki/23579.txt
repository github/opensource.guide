The photoelectric effect is the observation that many metals emit electrons when light shines upon them  Electrons emitted in this manner can be called photoelectrons   According to classical electromagnetic theory  this effect can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron in the metal  From this perspective  an alteration in either the amplitude or wavelength of light would induce changes in the rate of emission of electrons from the metal  Furthermore  according to this theory  a sufficiently dim light would be expected to show a lag time between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron  However  the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by this theory   Instead  as it turns out  electrons are only dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches or exceeds a threshold frequency  below which no electrons can be emitted from the metal regardless of the amplitude and temporal length of exposure of light  To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low  Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space  but rather a collection of discrete wave packets  photons   each with energy hf  This shed light on Max Planck s previous discovery of the Planck relation    linking energy  E  and frequency  f  as arising from quantization of energy  The factor h is known as the Planck constant   In 1887  Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily  In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets  This discovery led to the quantum revolution  Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for  his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect    The photoelectric effect requires photons with energies from a few electronvolts to over 1 MeV in elements with a high atomic number  Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of wave–particle duality  Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect  also known as photoconductivity or photoresistivity   the photovoltaic effect  and the photoelectrochemical effect   1  Emission mechanism  The photons of a light beam have a characteristic energy proportional to the frequency of the light  In the photoemission process  if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function  the electron binding energy  of the material  it is ejected  If the photon energy is too low  the electron is unable to escape the material  Since an increase in the intensity of low frequency light will only increase the number of low energy photons sent over a given interval of time  this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron  Thus  the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light  but only on the energy  equivalently frequency  of the individual photons  It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons   Electrons can absorb energy from photons when irradiated  but they usually follow an  all or nothing  principle  All of the energy from one photon must be absorbed and used to liberate one electron from atomic binding  or else the energy is re emitted  If the photon energy is absorbed  some of the energy liberates the electron from the atom  and the rest contributes to the electron s kinetic energy as a free particle   1 1  Experimental observations of photoelectric emission  The theory of the photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface   For a given metal  there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted  This frequency is called the threshold frequency  Increasing the frequency of the incident beam  keeping the number of incident photons fixed  this would result in a proportionate increase in energy  increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted  Thus the stopping voltage increases  The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy  If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased  there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron   Above the threshold frequency  the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light  but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high   For a given metal and frequency of incident radiation  the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light  An increase in the intensity of the incident beam  keeping the frequency fixed  increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current  although the stopping voltage remains the same   The time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small  less than 10−9 second   The direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of polarization  the direction of the electric field  of the incident light  if it is linearly polarized   1 2  Mathematical description  The maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron is given by  where is the Planck constant and is the frequency of the incident photon  The term is the work function  sometimes denoted   or    which gives the minimum energy required to remove a delocalised electron from the surface of the metal  The work function satisfies  where is the threshold frequency for the metal  The maximum kinetic energy of an ejected electron is then  Kinetic energy is positive  so we must have for the photoelectric effect to occur   1 3  Stopping potential  The relation between current and applied voltage illustrates the nature of the photoelectric effect  For discussion  a light source illuminates a plate P  and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons  We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the current flowing in the external circuit between the two plates   If the frequency and the intensity of the incident radiation are fixed  the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected  The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential  The saturation current depends on the intensity of illumination  but not its wavelength  as long as it exceeds the threshold wavelength    If we apply a negative potential to the collector plate Q with respect to the plate P and gradually increase it  the photoelectric current decreases  becoming zero at a certain negative potential  The negative potential on the collector at which the photoelectric current becomes zero is called the stopping potential or cut off potential  i  For a given frequency of incident radiation  the stopping potential is independent of its intensity   ii  For a given frequency of incident radiation  the stopping potential is determined by the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons that are emitted  If qe is the charge on the electron and is the stopping potential  then the work done by the retarding potential in stopping the electron is   so we have  Recalling  we see that the stopping voltage varies linearly with frequency of light  but depends on the type of material  For any particular material  there is a threshold frequency that must be exceeded  independent of light intensity  to observe any electron emission   1 4  Three step model  In the X ray regime  the photoelectric effect in crystalline material is often decomposed into three steps   Inner photoelectric effect  see photodiode below   The hole left behind can give rise to auger effect  which is visible even when the electron does not leave the material  In molecular solids phonons are excited in this step and may be visible as lines in the final electron energy  The inner photoeffect has to be dipole allowed  The transition rules for atoms translate via the tight binding model onto the crystal  They are similar in geometry to plasma oscillations in that they have to be transversal   Ballistic transport of half of the electrons to the surface  Some electrons are scattered   Electrons escape from the material at the surface  In the three step model  an electron can take multiple paths through these three steps  All paths can interfere in the sense of the path integral formulation  For surface states and molecules the three step model does still make some sense as even most atoms have multiple electrons which can scatter the one electron leaving   2  History  When a surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation above a certain threshold frequency  typically visible light for alkali metals  near ultraviolet for other metals  and extreme ultraviolet for non metals   the radiation is absorbed and electrons are emitted  Light  and especially ultra violet light  discharges negatively electrified bodies with the production of rays of the same nature as cathode rays  Under certain circumstances it can directly ionize gases  The first of these phenomena was discovered by Hertz and Hallwachs in 1887  The second was announced first by Philipp Lenard in 1900   The ultra violet light to produce these effects may be obtained from an arc lamp  or by burning magnesium  or by sparking with an induction coil between zinc or cadmium terminals  the light from which is very rich in ultra violet rays  Sunlight is not rich in ultra violet rays  as these have been absorbed by the atmosphere  and it does not produce nearly so large an effect as the arc light  Many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action of ultraviolet light  lists of these substances will be found in papers by G  C  Schmidt and O  Knoblauch   2 1  19th century  In 1839  Alexandre Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect while studying the effect of light on electrolytic cells  Though not equivalent to the photoelectric effect  his work on photovoltaics was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials  In 1873  Willoughby Smith discovered photoconductivity in selenium while testing the metal for its high resistance properties in conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph cables   Johann Elster  1854–1920  and Hans Geitel  1855–1923   students in Heidelberg  developed the first practical photoelectric cells that could be used to measure the intensity of light  Elster and Geitel had investigated with great success the effects produced by light on electrified bodies   In 1887  Heinrich Hertz observed the photoelectric effect and the production and reception of electromagnetic waves  He published these observations in the journal Annalen der Physik  His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap  where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves  He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better  However  he noticed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box  A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap  When removed  the spark length would increase  He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced glass with quartz  as quartz does not absorb UV radiation  Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained  He did not further pursue investigation of this effect   The discovery by Hertz in 1887 that the incidence of ultra violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark  led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs  Hoor  Righi and Stoletow  on the effect of light  and especially of ultra violet light  on charged bodies  It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc  if charged with negative electricity  rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra violet light falls upon the surface  while if the surface is uncharged to begin with  it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light  the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded  this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface  If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light  this result has been questioned  but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge  the negative electricity under the influence of the electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface   With regard to the Hertz effect  the researches from the start showed a great complexity of the phenomenon of photoelectric fatigue — that is  the progressive diminution of the effect observed upon fresh metallic surfaces  According to an important research by Wilhelm Hallwachs  ozone played an important part in the phenomenon  However  other elements enter such as oxidation  the humidity  the mode of polish of the surface  etc  It was at the time not even sure that the fatigue is absent in a vacuum   In the period from February 1888 and until 1891  a detailed analysis of photoeffect was performed by Aleksandr Stoletov with results published in 6 works  four of them in Comptes Rendus  one review in Physikalische Revue  translated from Russian   and the last work in Journal de Physique  First  in these works Stoletov invented a new experimental setup which was more suitable for a quantitative analysis of photoeffect  Using this setup  he discovered the direct proportionality between the intensity of light and the induced photo electric current  the first law of photoeffect or Stoletov s law   One of his other findings resulted from measurements of the dependence of the intensity of the electric photo current on the gas pressure  where he found the existence of an optimal gas pressure Pm corresponding to a maximum photocurrent  this property was used for a creation of solar cells   In 1899  J  J  Thomson investigated ultraviolet light in Crookes tubes  Thomson deduced that the ejected particles were the same as those previously found in the cathode ray  later called electrons  which he called  corpuscles   In the research  Thomson enclosed a metal plate  a cathode  in a vacuum tube  and exposed it to high frequency radiation  It was thought that the oscillating electromagnetic fields caused the atoms  field to resonate and  after reaching a certain amplitude  caused a subatomic  corpuscle  to be emitted  and current to be detected  The amount of this current varied with the intensity and colour of the radiation  Larger radiation intensity or frequency would produce more current   2 2  20th century  The discovery of the ionization of gases by ultra violet light was made by Philipp Lenard in 1900  As the effect was produced across several centimeters of air and made very great positive and small negative ions  it was natural to interpret the phenomenon  as did J  J  Thomson  as a Hertz effect upon the solid or liquid particles present in the gas   In 1902  Lenard observed that the energy of individual emitted electrons increased with the frequency  which is related to the color  of the light   This appeared to be at odds with Maxwell s wave theory of light  which predicted that the electron energy would be proportional to the intensity of the radiation   Lenard observed the variation in electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity  and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency  His experiment directly measured potentials  not electron kinetic energy  he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential  voltage  in a phototube  He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy is determined by the frequency of the light  For example  an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light  However Lenard s results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments  the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed  but it oxidised in a matter of minutes even in the partial vacuums he used  The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light s intensity  or brightness  doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface   The researches of Langevin and those of Eugene Bloch have shown that the greater part of the Lenard effect is certainly due to this  Hertz effect   The Lenard effect upon the gas itself nevertheless does exist  Refound by J  J  Thomson and then more decisively by Frederic Palmer  Jr   it was studied and showed very different characteristics than those at first attributed to it by Lenard   In 1905  Albert Einstein solved this apparent paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta  now called photons  rather than continuous waves  Based upon Max Planck s theory of black body radiation  Einstein theorized that the energy in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency multiplied by a constant  later called Planck s constant  A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a single electron  creating the observed effect  This discovery led to the quantum revolution in physics and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921  By wave particle duality the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently   Albert Einstein s mathematical description of how the photoelectric effect was caused by absorption of quanta of light was in one of his 1905 papers  named  On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light   This paper proposed the simple description of  light quanta   or photons  and showed how they explained such phenomena as the photoelectric effect  His simple explanation in terms of absorption of discrete quanta of light explained the features of the phenomenon and the characteristic frequency   The idea of light quanta began with Max Planck s published law of black body radiation   On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum   by assuming that Hertzian oscillators could only exist at energies E proportional to the frequency f of the oscillator by E   hf  where h is Planck s constant  By assuming that light actually consisted of discrete energy packets  Einstein wrote an equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental results  It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was dependent only on the frequency of the incident light and not on its intensity  a low intensity  high frequency source could supply a few high energy photons  whereas a high intensity  low frequency source would supply no photons of sufficient individual energy to dislodge any electrons  This was an enormous theoretical leap  but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from James Clerk Maxwell s equations for electromagnetic behavior  and more generally  the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems  Even after experiments showed that Einstein s equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate  resistance to the idea of photons continued  since it appeared to contradict Maxwell s equations  which were well understood and verified   Einstein s work predicted that the energy of individual ejected electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light  Perhaps surprisingly  the precise relationship had not at that time been tested  By 1905 it was known that the energy of photoelectrons increases with increasing frequency of incident light and is independent of the intensity of the light  However  the manner of the increase was not experimentally determined until 1914 when Robert Andrews Millikan showed that Einstein s prediction was correct   The photoelectric effect helped to propel the then emerging concept of wave–particle duality in the nature of light  Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles  each being manifested according to the circumstances  The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light  as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation  Classical theory predicted that the electrons would  gather up  energy over a period of time  and then be emitted   3  Uses and effects  3 1  Photomultipliers  These are extremely light sensitive vacuum tubes with a photocathode coated onto part  an end or side  of the inside of the envelope  The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as caesium  rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function  so when illuminated even by very low levels of light  the photocathode readily releases electrons  By means of a series of electrodes  dynodes  at ever higher potentials  these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable output current  Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected   3 2  Image sensors  Video camera tubes in the early days of television used the photoelectric effect  for example  Philo Farnsworth s  Image dissector  used a screen charged by the photoelectric effect to transform an optical image into a scanned electronic signal   3 3  Gold leaf electroscope  Gold leaf electroscopes are designed to detect static electricity  Charge placed on the metal cap spreads to the stem and the gold leaf of the electroscope  Because they then have the same charge  the stem and leaf repel each other  This will cause the leaf to bend away from the stem   The electroscope is an important tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect  For example  if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout  there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem  If high frequency light shines on the cap  the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp  This is because the frequency of the light shining on the cap is above the cap s threshold frequency  The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap  reducing its negative charge  This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope  However  if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency  its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap   then the leaf will never discharge  no matter how long one shines the low frequency light at the cap   3 4  Photoelectron spectroscopy  Since the energy of the photoelectrons emitted is exactly the energy of the incident photon minus the material s work function or binding energy  the work function of a sample can be determined by bombarding it with a monochromatic X ray source or UV source  and measuring the kinetic energy distribution of the electrons emitted   Photoelectron spectroscopy is usually done in a high vacuum environment  since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present  However  some companies are now selling products that allow photoemission in air  The light source can be a laser  a discharge tube  or a synchrotron radiation source   The concentric hemispherical analyser  CHA  is a typical electron energy analyzer  and uses an electric field to change the directions of incident electrons  depending on their kinetic energies  For every element and core  atomic orbital  there will be a different binding energy  The many electrons created from each of these combinations will show up as spikes in the analyzer output  and these can be used to determine the elemental composition of the sample   3 5  Spacecraft  The photoelectric effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge  This can be a major problem  as other parts of the spacecraft in shadow develop a negative charge from nearby plasma  and the imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components  The static charge created by the photoelectric effect is self limiting  though  because a more highly charged object gives up its electrons less easily   3 6  Moon dust  Light from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the photoelectric effect  The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the Moon by electrostatic levitation  This manifests itself almost like an  atmosphere of dust   visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features  and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set  This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s  It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled up to kilometers high  and that the particles move in  fountains  as they charge and discharge   3 7  Night vision devices  Photons hitting a thin film of alkali metal or semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect  These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen  converting the electrons back into photons  Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by increasing the number of electrons through secondary emissions  such as with a micro channel plate  Sometimes a combination of both methods is used  Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level  This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band  explained by the band gap model  Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band  In these materials  electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such  the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick  These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials   4  Cross section  The photoelectric effect is one interaction mechanism between photons and atoms  It is one of 12 theoretically possible interactions   At the high photon energies comparable to the electron rest energy of   Compton scattering  another process  may take place  Above twice this    pair production may take place  Compton scattering and pair production are examples of two other competing mechanisms   Indeed  even if the photoelectric effect is the favoured reaction for a particular single photon bound electron interaction  the result is also subject to statistical processes and is not guaranteed  albeit the photon has certainly disappeared and a bound electron has been excited  usually K or L shell electrons at gamma ray energies   The probability of the photoelectric effect occurring is measured by the cross section of interaction  σ  This has been found to be a function of the atomic number of the target atom and photon energy  A crude approximation  for photon energies above the highest atomic binding energy  is given by   Here Z is atomic number and n is a number which varies between 4 and 5   At lower photon energies a characteristic structure with edges appears  K edge  L edges  M edges  etc   The obvious interpretation follows that the photoelectric effect rapidly decreases in significance  in the gamma ray region of the spectrum  with increasing photon energy  and that photoelectric effect increases steeply with atomic number  The corollary is that high Z materials make good gamma ray shields  which is the principal reason that lead  Z   82  is a preferred and ubiquitous gamma radiation shield   5  See also  Electronics   Photocurrent  Photomultiplier  Solar cell  Solar energy Physics   Anomalous
