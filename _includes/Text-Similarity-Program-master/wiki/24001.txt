Paris  Texas is a city and county seat of Lamar County  Texas  United States  As of the 2010 census  the population of the city was 25 171  It is situated in Northeast Texas at the western edge of the Piney Woods  and northeast of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex  Physiographically  these regions are part of the West Gulf Coastal Plain   Local residents like the humorous slogan  Second Largest Paris in the World   Following a tradition of American cities named  Paris   a replica of the Eiffel Tower was constructed in 1993  In 1998  presumably as a response to the 1993 construction of a tower in Paris  Tennessee  the city placed a giant red cowboy hat atop the tower  The current tower is at least the second Eiffel Tower replica built in Paris  the first was constructed of wood and later destroyed by a tornado   1  History  Lamar County was first settled by several groups in different parts of an area to the west of Jonesborough and Clarksville  There was a group on the Red River at a place called Fulton  one near what is called Emberson now  one to the southeast of there about 12 miles near where today is the North Lamar school complex  another southwest of that at the Chisum Johnson community called Pinhook  and a group of pioneers to the east of that about six miles at Moore s Springs  Then  in late 1839 George W  Wright moved from his farm northeast of Clarksville to a hill where he purchased 1 000 acres from Larkin Rattan  At the time no permanent settler resided on this land  It was on the old road that led from the Kiomatia River s mouth at the Red River west into the Grand Prairie  Wright established a store on the northeast portion of his property  on the road  By December 1840 a new county was formed  named in honor of the Republic of Texas President Mirabeau B  Lamar  By September 1841 Wright s store was called Paris  and was a local postal office  In August 1844  the county commissioners decided to take Wright s offer of 50 acres and establish the county seat in the middle  at the town of Paris   The area of present Lamar County was within the boundaries of Red River County at the time of the Republic of Texas  By 1840 population growth necessitated a new county  and legislation was introduced by representatives from Red River County  Wright  who had served in the Third Congress as a representative from Red River County  was a major promoter of the founding of Lamar County  which was established by act of the Fifth Congress of the republic on December 17  1840  and organized by election on February 1  1841  At the time  the county included much of what is now Delta County   In 1870  Delta County was formed  and Lamar County was reduced to its present size  The county was named for Mirabeau B  Lamar  the fourth president of the Republic of Texas  The original county seat was Lafayette  a small settlement located several miles northwest of the site of present day Paris  On June 22  1841  forty acres of land was donated by John Watson for building a proper county seat  but though the town was platted  no lots were ever sold  The county court continued to meet at Lafayette  however  until the Texas Congress passed a law in 1842 requiring that each county seat be located within five miles of the geographic center of the county  Mount Vernon was made Lamar county seat in 1843  but again no courthouse was built  In 1844 Wright  who had purchased 1 000 acres near the settlement of Pinhook  offered to donate fifty acres to the county for a townsite if the county commissioners would make it the county seat  The offer was accepted  and the new town was named Paris  The first term of the county court was held there on April 29  1844  Paris is still the county seat  The first recorded settlement in the vicinity was in 1826  and settlements were known to be in the area as early as 1824  The town was founded by merchant George W  Wright  who donated of land in February 1844  when the community was also designated the county seat  It was incorporated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas on February 3  1845  Paris was on the Central National Road of the Republic of Texas  which ran from San Antonio north through Paris to cross the Red River  By the eve of the Civil War  when it had 700 residents  Paris had become a cattle and farming center  It is the site of the first municipally owned and operated abattoir in the United States  Lamar County was one of the few Texas counties that voted against secession  though many of its inhabitants later served in the Confederacy   In 1877  1896  and 1916  major fires forced the city to rebuild  The 1916 fire was so extensive that it destroyed almost half the town  ruining most of the central business district and sweeping through a residential area before it was finally controlled  resulting in property damages estimated at $11 million  Burned structures included the Federal Building and post office  Lamar County Courthouse and Jail  City Hall  most commercial buildings  and several churches  The 1916 fire started around 5 p m  on March 21  1916  The exact cause of the fire is unknown  Winds estimated at 50 miles per hour fanned the flames that were visible for up to forty miles away  The fire was brought under control on the morning on March 22 by local firefighters and those from surrounding cities in Texas and Hugo  Oklahoma   In 1943  the U S  Supreme Court struck down a Paris law requiring permits to take order for books in Largent v  Texas  The court found the law s intent was to violate the free speech rights of Jehovah s Witnesses   The film Paris  Texas by Wim Wenders was named after the city  but was not set there   1 1  Eiffel Tower Replica  There are fifteen American municipalities named  Paris   and many erected Eiffel Towers to pay homage to the city in Paris  France   Both Paris of Texas and Paris  Tennessee built Eiffel Tower replicas in 1993  Tennessee s was built at Christian Brothers University  in Memphis  and was 60 feet tall  Texas s was built by the Boilermakers 902  a labor union representing workers of the former Babcock and Wilcox Paris Plant  and was 65 feet tall  In 1998 when Tennessee moved its  tower to Paris they expanded their tower to 70 feet   Paris  Texas  made the claim of being  The second largest Paris in the World   so in 1998 town boosters added a large red cowboy hat to the top of the tower  which made it taller than Tennessee s tower   However  in 1999  Las Vegas erected a 540 foot tall Eiffel Tower replica along the Strip  At half the height of the original  which is 984 feet tall   this Eiffel Tower is nearly ten times taller than the other replicas   1 2  Transportation  Paris has long been a railroad center  The Texas and Pacific reached town in 1876  the Gulf  Colorado and Santa Fe Railway  later merged into the Atchison  Topeka and Santa Fe Railway  and the St  Louis   San Francisco Railway in 1887  the Texas Midland  later Southern Pacific  in 1894  and the Paris and Mount Pleasant  Pa Ma Line  in 1910   1 3  Historical residences  The city is home to several stately late 19th century to mid 20th century homes  Among these is the Rufus Fenner Scott Mansion  designed by German architect J L  Wees and constructed in 1910  The structure is solid concrete and steel with four floors  Rufus Scott was a prominent businessman known for shipping  imports  and banking  He was well known by local farmers who bought aging transport mules from Mr  Scott  The Scott Mansion narrowly survived the fire of 1916  After the fire  Mr  Scott brought Mr  Wees back to Paris to redesign the historic downtown area  In the early 1930s  Rufus Scott died  and his home was purchased by Gene Roden  who converted the home into a funeral home  It was the first funeral home in northeast Texas to have its own chapel  The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982  On April 1  2006  Gene Roden s Sons Funeral Home was sold to Arvin Starrett and E  Casey Rose  who was managing the firm at the time  and the name was changed to Starrett Rose Funeral Home  In March 2007  Casey Rose sold his 50% interest in the firm to Arvin Starrett and the name became Starrett Funeral Home   Also of note is the recently restored home of William Belford Wise  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988  the property is an example of late Victorian Queen Anne style architecture in masonry   Henry Smith  born 1876  was an African American who was tortured and murdered at a public  heavily attended and promoted lynching on February 1  1893 at the Paris Fairgrounds in Paris  Texas  Smith was accused of the brutal murder of three year old Myrtle Vance  the daughter of a policeman known for mistreating prisoners  Smith was among those who had previously been beaten by Myrtle s father  after he had been arrested for drunkenness  He was a neighborhood handyman and known alcoholic  According to a New York Times article from Feb  1  1893  Smith allegedly   picked up little Myrtle Vance     near her father s residence  and     carried her through the central portion of the city    En route through the city he was asked by several persons what he was doing with the child   1  When the police found no clues to the child s death citation needed   people in the area decided Smith must have committed the crime  After Myrtle s body was found  Smith continued life as usual citation needed   but upon hearing a mob was after him  he fled to Hope  Arkansas  There he was captured and brought back to Paris by train  where a mob of an estimated 10 000 whites placed him on a carnival float and carried him through town and out into a prairie  There  he was placed upon a scaffold and tortured for fifty minutes by members of the girl s family  who thrust hot iron brands into his flesh  starting with his feet and legs and working upward to his head  The family members involved included Myrtle s father  uncles  and twelve year old brother  A February 2  1893 article in the New York Sun stated that   Every groan from the fiend  every contortion of his body was cheered by the thickly packed crowd   Eventually  the hot irons were thrust into his eye sockets and down his throat  Afterwards  finding he was still breathing  the crowd poured oil on him and set him on fire  According to some newspaper accounts  Smith remained alive during the burning  He is said to have torn himself away from the post and fallen off the scaffolding  where he perished  The crowd then fought over the hot ashes to collect his bones and teeth as souvenirs  2  On February 7  Henry Smith s stepson  William Butler  was lynched outside Paris  Though Butler was known as an upstanding citizen  he was hanged only on suspicion that he had known  and not divulged  the whereabouts of Henry Smith after he had fled   1 4  Paris Junior College  Paris Junior College was established in 1924  In 1990  it
