A programmer  computer programmer  developer  coder  or software engineer is a person who writes computer software  The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software  One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst  A programmer s primary computer language  C  C++  C#  Java  Lisp  Python  etc   is often prefixed to the above titles  and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with Web  The term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer  Web developer  mobile applications developer  embedded firmware developer  software engineer  computer scientist  or software analyst  However  members of these professions possess other software engineering skills  beyond programming  for this reason  the term programmer  or code monkey  is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions  This has sparked much debate amongst developers  analysts  computer scientists  programmers  and outsiders who continue to be puzzled at the subtle differences in the definitions of these occupations   British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer  as she was the first to write and publish an algorithm intended for implementation on Charles Babbage s analytical engine  in October 1842  intended for the calculation of Bernoulli numbers  Lovelace was also the first person to comment on the potential for computers to be used for purposes other than computing calculations  Because Babbage s machine was never completed to a functioning standard in her time  she never saw her algorithm run   The first person to run a program on a functioning modern electronically based computer was computer scientist Konrad Zuse  in 1941   The ENIAC programming team  consisting of Kay McNulty  Betty Jennings  Betty Snyder  Marlyn Wescoff  Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman were the first regularly working programmers   International Programmers  Day is celebrated annually on 7 January  In 2009  the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday known as Programmers  Day to be celebrated on 13 September  12 September in leap years   It had also been an unofficial international holiday before that   1  Nature of the work  Computer programmers write  test  debug  and maintain the detailed instructions  called computer programs  that computers must follow to perform their functions  Programmers also conceive  design  and test logical structures for solving problems by computer  Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today  Job titles and descriptions may vary  depending on the organization   Programmers work in many settings  including corporate information technology   IT   departments  big software companies  and small service firms  Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors  Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer  although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers  Programming is widely considered a profession  although some authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession    Programmers  work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs  For example  the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator  Simple programs can be written in a few hours  more complex ones may require more than a year of work  while others are never considered  complete  but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use  In most cases  several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer’s supervision   Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and by systems analysts  After the design process is complete  it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow  The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages  Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program  COBOL  for example  is commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers  whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering  C++ is widely used for both scientific and business applications  Java  C#  VB and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications  Programmers generally know more than one programming language and  because many languages are similar  they often can learn new languages relatively easily  In practice  programmers often are referred to by the language they know  e g  as Java programmers  or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work  for example  database programmers  mainframe programmers  or Web developers   When making changes to the source code that programs are made up of  programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform  They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that others can understand the program more easily and by documenting their code  To save work  programmers often use libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application  This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers  productivity by eliminating some routine steps   1 1  Testing and debugging  Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs  errors   As they are identified  the programmer usually makes the appropriate corrections  then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity of bugs remain  This process is called testing and debugging  These are important parts of every programmer s job  Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program  Updating  repairing  modifying  and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance programming  Programmers may contribute to user guides and online help  or they may work with technical writers to do such work   1 2  Application versus system programming  Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types  application programmers and systems programmers  Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job  such as a program to track inventory within an organization  They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from independent software vendors  Systems programmers  in contrast  write programs to maintain and control computer systems software  such as operating systems and database management systems  These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network  workstations  and CPU of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers and disk drives   1 3  Types of software  Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create software – either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use – ranging from video games to educational software to programs for desktop publishing and financial planning  Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry  Some companies or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and development of in house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end users  especially when existing software are not suitable or too expensive  This is for example the case in research laboratories   In some organizations  particularly small ones  workers commonly known as programmer analysts are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming work  The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily on personal computers  PCs  has blurred the once rigid distinction between the programmer and the user  Increasingly  adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by programmers  For example  the growing use of packaged software  such as spreadsheet and database management software packages  allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations   In addition  the rise of the Internet has made web development a huge part of the programming field  Currently more software applications are web applications that can be used by anyone with a web browser  Examples of such applications include the Google search service  the Hotmail e mail service  and the Flickr photo sharing service   Programming editors  also known as source code editors  are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers for writing the source code of an application or a program  Most of these editors include features useful for programmers  which may include color syntax highlighting  auto indentation  auto complete  bracket matching  syntax check  and allows plug ins  These features aid the users during coding  debugging and testing   2  Globalization  2 1  Market changes in the UK  According to BBC News  17% of computer science students could not find work in their field 6 months after graduation in 2009 which was the highest rate of the university subjects surveyed while 0% of medical students were unemployed in the same survey  The UK category system does  however  class such degrees as information technology and game design as  computer science   industries in which jobs can be extremely difficult to find  somewhat inflating the actual figure   2 2  Market changes in the US  Computer programming  offshore outsourcing  and Foreign Worker Visas became a controversial topic after the crash of the dot com bubble left many programmers without work or with lower wages  Programming was even mentioned in the 2004 US Presidential debate on the topic of offshore outsourcing   Large companies claim there is a skills shortage with regard to programming talent  However  US programmers and unions counter that large companies are exaggerating their case in order to obtain cheaper programmers from developing countries and to avoid paying for training in very specific technologies   Enrollment in computer related degrees in US has dropped recently due to lack of general interests in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers  This situation has resulted in confusion about whether the US economy is entering a  post information age  and the nature of US comparative advantages  Technology and software jobs were supposed to be the replacement for factory and agriculture jobs lost to cheaper foreign labor  but if those are subject to free trade losses  then the nature of the next generation of replacement careers is not clear at this point   3  See also  Game programmer  List of programmers  Software
