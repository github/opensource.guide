town had a hotel which also operated as a post office   After World War I  an attempt by the Government of Western Australia to attract migrants to Western Australia  known as the Group Settlement Scheme  and establish farms in the region attracted new settlers to the town  In 1922 over 100 settlers moved into the district   In the early 1920s the Busselton to Margaret River Railway was built

record measurable rainfall and around one in ten over   On occasions  as in August 1955  the town has had measurable rain on every day of a month in this period  During the summer  the weather is very warm  though there are usually sea breezes  and frequently sunny  The hot dry summers  coupled with strong winds  creates an environment where there is always a high risk of bush fires   3  Wine region  Margaret River is the foremost Geographical Indication wine region in the South West Australia Zone  with nearly under vine and over 138 wineries as at 2008  The region is made up

Australian grape production  but commands over 20 percent of the Australian premium wine market   Stretching some from north to south and about wide in parts  the region is bounded to the east by the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge  between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin  and to the west by the Indian Ocean  A Mediterranean style climate  lacking extreme summer and winter temperatures  provides ideal growing conditions  The climate is described as similar to that of Bordeaux in a dry vintage   Humidity levels are ideal during the growing period and the combination of climate  soil and viticulture practices leads to consistently high quality fruit of intense flavour  Consequently  annual vintage results continue to exceed expectations and reinforce Margaret River s reputation as one of the premium wine producing regions of the world   The principal grape varieties in the region are fairly evenly split between red and white  Cabernet Sauvignon  Chardonnay  Sauvignon blanc  Shiraz  Merlot  Chenin blanc and Verdelho   4  Caves  Several hundred caves are located near Margaret River  all of them within Leeuwin Naturaliste National Park  Six of these are open to the public   The most
