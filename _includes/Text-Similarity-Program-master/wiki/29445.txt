The StrongARM is a family of computer microprocessors developed by Digital Equipment Corporation and manufactured in the late 1990s which implemented the ARM v4 instruction set architecture  It was later sold to Intel in 1997  who continued to manufacture it before replacing it with the XScale in the early 2000s   1  History  The StrongARM was a collaborative project between DEC and Advanced RISC Machines to create a faster ARM microprocessor  The StrongARM was designed to address the upper end of the low power embedded market  where users needed more performance than the ARM could deliver while being able to accept more external support  Targets were devices such as newer personal digital assistants and set top boxes   Traditionally  the semiconductor division of DEC was located in Massachusetts  In order to gain access to the design talent in Silicon Valley  DEC opened a design center in Palo Alto  California  This design center was led by Dan Dobberpuhl and was the main design site for the StrongARM project  Another design site which worked on the project was in Austin  Texas that was created by some ex DEC designers returning from Apple Computer and Motorola  The project was set up in 1995  and quickly delivered their first design  the SA 110   DEC agreed to sell StrongARM to Intel as part of a lawsuit settlement in 1997  Intel used the StrongARM to replace their ailing line of RISC processors  the i860 and i960   When the semiconductor division of DEC was sold to Intel  many engineers from the Palo Alto design group moved to SiByte  a start up company designing MIPS system on a chip  SoC  products for the networking market  The Austin design group spun off to become Alchemy Semiconductor  another start up company designing MIPS SoCs for the hand held market  A new StrongARM core was developed by Intel and introduced in 2000 as the XScale   2  SA 110  The SA 110 was the first microprocessor in the StrongARM family  The first versions  operating at 100  160  and 200 MHz  were announced on 5 February 1996  When announced  samples of these versions were available  with volume production slated for mid 1996  Faster 166 and 233 MHz versions were announced on 12 September 1996  Samples of these versions were available at announcement  with volume production slated for December 1996  Throughout 1996  the SA 110 was the highest performing microprocessor for portable devices  Towards the end of 1996 it was a leading CPU for internet intranet appliances and thin client systems  The SA 110 s first design win was the Apple MessagePad 2000  It was also used in a number of products including the Acorn Computers Risc PC and Eidos Optima video editing system  The SA 110 s lead designers were Daniel W  Dobberpuhl  Gregory W  Hoeppner  Liam Madden  and Richard T  Witek   2 1  Description  The SA 110 had a simple microarchitecture  It was a scalar design that executed instructions in order with a five stage classic RISC pipeline  The microprocessor was partitioned into several blocks  the IBOX  EBOX  IMMU  DMMU  BIU  WB and PLL  The IBOX contained hardware that operated in the first two stages of the pipeline such as the program counter  It fetched  decoded and issued instructions  Instruction fetch occurs during the first stage  decode and issue during the second  The IBOX decodes the more complex instructions in the ARM instruction set by translating them into sequences of simpler instructions  The IBOX also handled branch instructions  The SA 110 did not have branch prediction hardware  but had mechanisms for their speedy processing   Execution starts at stage three  The hardware that operates during this stage is contained in the EBOX  which comprises the register file  arithmetic logic unit  ALU   barrel shifter  multiplier and condition code logic  The register file had three read ports and two write ports  The ALU and barrel shifter executed instructions in a single cycle  The multiplier is not pipelined and has a latency of multiple cycles   The IMMU and DMMU are memory management units for instructions and data  respectively  Each MMU contained a 32 entry fully associative translation lookaside buffer  TLB  that can map 4 KB  64 KB or 1 MB pages  The write buffer  WB  has eight 16 byte entries  It enables the pipelining of stores  The bus interface unit  BIU  provided the SA 110 with an external interface   The PLL generates the internal clock signal from an external 3 68 MHz clock signal  It was not designed by DEC  but was contracted to the Centre Suisse d Electronique et de Microtechnique  CSEM  located in Neuchâtel  Switzerland   The instruction cache and data cache each have a capacity of 16 KB and are 32 way set associative and virtually addressed  The SA 110 was designed to be used with slow  and therefore low cost  memory and therefore the high set associativity allows a higher hit rate than competing designs  and the use of virtual addresses allows memory to be simultaneously cached and uncached  The caches are responsible for most of the transistor count and they take up half the die area   The SA 110 contained 2 5 million transistors and is 7 8 mm by 6 4 mm large  49 92 mm2   It was fabricated by DEC in its proprietary CMOS 6 process at its Fab 6 fab in Hudson  Massachusetts  CMOS 6 was DEC s sixth generation complementary metal&ndash oxide&ndash semiconductor  CMOS  process  CMOS 6 has a 0 35 µm feature size  a 0 25 µm effective channel length but for use with the SA 110  only three levels of aluminium interconnect  It used a power supply with a variable voltage of 1 2 to 2 2 volts  V  to enable designs to find a balance between power consumption and performance  higher voltages enable higher clock rates   The SA 110 was packaged in a 144 pin thin quad flat pack  TQFP    3  SA 1100  The SA 1100 was a derivative of the SA 110 developed by DEC  Announced in 1997  the SA 1100 was targeted for portable applications such as PDAs and differs from the SA 110 by providing a number of features that are desirable for such applications  To accommodate these features  the data cache was reduced in size to 8 KB   The extra features are integrated memory  PCMCIA  and color LCD controllers connected to an on die system bus  and five serial I O channels that are connected to a peripheral bus attached to the system bus  The memory controller supported FPM and EDO DRAM  SRAM  flash  and ROM  The PCMCIA controller supports two slots  The memory address and data bus is shared with the PCMCIA interface  Glue logic is required  The serial I O channels implement a slave USB interface  a SDLC  two UARTs  an IrDA interface  a MCP  and a synchronous serial port   The SA 1100 had a companion chip  the SA 1101  It was introduced by Intel on 7 October 1998  The SA 1101 provided additional peripherals to complement those integrated on the SA 1100 such as a video output port  two PS 2 ports  a USB controller and a PCMCIA controller that replaces that on the SA 1100  Design of the device started by DEC  but was only partially complete when acquired by Intel  who had to finish the design  It was fabricated at DEC s former Hudson  Massachusetts fabrication plant  which was also sold to Intel   The SA 1100 contained 2 5 million transistors and measured 8 24 mm by 9 12 mm  75 15 mm2   It was fabricated in a 0 35 μm CMOS process with three levels of aluminium interconnect and was packaged in a 208 pin TQFP   One of the early recipients of this processor was ill fated Psion netBook and its more consumer oriented sibling Psion Series 7   4  SA 1110  The SA 1110 was a derivative of the SA 110 developed by Intel  It was announced on 31 March 1999  positioned as an alternative to the SA 1100  At announcement  samples were set for June 1999 and volume later that year  Intel discontinued the SA 1110 in early 2003  The SA 1110 was available in 133 or 206 MHz versions  It differed from the SA 1100 by featuring support for 66 MHz  133 MHz version only  or 103 MHz  206 MHz version only  SDRAM  Its companion chip  which provided additional support for peripherals  was the SA 1111  The SA 1110 was packaged in a 256 pin micro ball grid array  It was used in mobile phones  personal data assistants  PDAs  such as the Compaq  later HP  iPAQ and HP Jornada  the Sharp SL 5x00 Linux Based Platforms and the Simputer   5  SA 1500  The SA 1500 was a derivative of the SA 110 developed by DEC initially targeted for set top boxes  It was designed and manufactured in low volumes by DEC but was never put into production by Intel  The SA 1500 was available at 200 to 300 MHz  The SA 1500 featured an enhanced SA 110 core  an on chip coprocessor called the Attached Media Processor  AMP   and an on chip SDRAM and I O bus controller  The SDRAM controller supported 100 MHz SDRAM  and the I O controller implemented a 32 bit I O bus that may run at frequencies up to 50 MHz for connecting to peripherals and the SA 1501 companion chip   The AMP implemented a long instruction word instruction set containing instructions designed for multimedia  such as integer and floating point multiply–accumulate and SIMD arithmetic  Each long instruction word is 64 bits wide and specifies an arithmetic operation and a branch or a load store  Instructions operate on operands from a 64 entry 36 bit register file  and on a set of control registers  The AMP communicates with the SA 110 core via an on chip bus and it shares the data cache with the SA 110  The AMP contained an ALU with a shifter  a branch unit  a load store unit  a multiply–accumulate unit  and a single precision floating point unit  The AMP supported user defined instructions via a 512 entry writable control store   The SA 1501 companion chip provided additional video and audio processing capabilities and various I O functions such as PS 2 ports  a parallel port  and interfaces for various peripherals   The SA 1500 contains 3 3 million transistors and measures 60 mm2  It was fabricated in a 0 28 µm CMOS process  It used a 1 5 to 2 0 V internal power supply and 3 3 V I O  consuming less than 0 5 W at 100 MHz and 2 5 W at 300 MHz  It was packaged in a 240 pin metal quad flat package or a 256 ball plastic ball grid array   6  References  7  Further reading   StrongARM 1500 Grapples With MPEG 2    8 December 1997   Microprocessor Report
