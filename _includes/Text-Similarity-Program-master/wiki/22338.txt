Operation Sea Lion    was Nazi Germany s plan to invade the United Kingdom during the Second World War  following the Fall of France  For any likelihood of success  however  the operation required both air and naval superiority over the English Channel  neither of which the Germans ever achieved during or after the Battle of Britain  Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940 and never carried out   1  Background  Adolf Hitler had decided by early November 1939 on forcing an end to the war by invading France  In order to avoid the heavily defended Maginot Line the Germans had to invade Belgium  the Netherlands and Luxembourg in order to invade France  With the prospect of the Channel ports falling under Kriegsmarine  the German navy  control  and attempting to anticipate the obvious next step that might entail  Grand Admiral  Großadmiral  Erich Raeder  head of the Kriegsmarine  instructed his operations officer  Kapitän Hans Jürgen Reinicke  to draw up a document examining  the possibility of troop landings in England should the future progress of the war make the problem arise   Reinicke spent five days on this study and set forth the following prerequisites   Elimination or sealing off of Royal Navy forces from the landing and approach areas   Elimination of the Royal Air Force  RAF    Destruction of all Royal Navy units in the coastal zone   Prevention of British submarine action against the landing fleet  In December 1939  the German Army issued its own study paper  designated Nordwest  and solicited opinions and input from both the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe  the German Air Force   The paper outlined an assault on England s eastern coast between The Wash and the River Thames by troops crossing the North Sea from Low Country ports  Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring  head of the Luftwaffe  responded with a single page letter in which he stated      a combined operation having the objective of landing in England must be rejected  It could only be the final act of an already victorious war against Britain as otherwise the preconditions for success of a combined operation would not be met   The Kriegsmarine response was rather more restrained but equally focused on pointing out the many difficulties to be surmounted if invading England was to be a viable option   Later in the spring of 1940 the Kriegsmarine became even more opposed to invading Britain after its Pyrrhic victory in Norway  After Operation Weserübung  as the invasion of Norway had been code named  the Kriegsmarine had only one heavy cruiser  two light cruisers  and four destroyers available for operations  Admiral Raeder was strongly opposed to Sea Lion since almost the entire Kriegsmarine surface fleet had been either sunk or badly damaged in Weserübung  and his service was hopelessly outnumbered by the ships of the Royal Navy   On 16 July 1940  following Germany s swift and successful occupation of France and the Low Countries and growing impatient with Britain s outright rejection of his recent peace overtures  Hitler issued Führer Directive No  16  setting in motion preparations for a landing in Britain  He prefaced the order by stating   As England  in spite of her hopeless military situation  still shows no signs of willingness to come to terms  I have decided to prepare  and if necessary to carry out  a landing operation against her  The aim of this operation is to eliminate the English Motherland as a base from which the war against Germany can be continued  and  if necessary  to occupy the country completely    Hitler s directive set four conditions for the invasion to occur   The RAF was to be  beaten down in its morale and in fact  that it can no longer display any appreciable aggressive force in opposition to the German crossing    The English Channel was to be swept of British mines at the crossing points  and the Strait of Dover must be blocked at both ends by German mines   The coastal zone between occupied France and England must be dominated by heavy artillery   The Royal Navy must be sufficiently engaged in the North Sea and the Mediterranean so that it could not intervene in the crossing  British home squadrons must be damaged or destroyed by air and torpedo attacks  This ultimately placed responsibility for Sea Lions success squarely on the shoulders of Raeder and Göring  neither of whom had the slightest enthusiasm for the venture and  in fact  did little to hide their opposition to it  Nor did Directive 16 provide for a combined operational headquarters under which all three service branches  Army  Navy  Air Force  could work together under a single umbrella organisation to plan  coordinate and execute such a complex undertaking  similar to the Allies  creation of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force  SHAEF  for the later Normandy landings    Upon hearing of Hitler s intentions  Italian dictator Benito Mussolini  through his Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano  quickly offered up to ten divisions and thirty squadrons of Italian aircraft for the proposed invasion  Hitler initially declined any such aid but eventually allowed a small contingent of Italian fighters and bombers  the Italian Air Corps  Corpo Aereo Italiano or CAI   to assist in the Luftwaffe s aerial campaign over Britain in October November 1940   2  German land forces  In the plan finalised in August 1940  the invasion force was organised into two army groups drawn from the 6th Army  the 9th Army and the 16th Army  The first wave of the landing would have consisted of eleven infantry and mountain divisions  the second wave of eight panzer and motorised infantry divisions and finally  the third wave was formed of six further infantry divisions  The initial assault would have also included two airborne divisions and the special forces of the Brandenburg Regiment   3  Air power  3 1  Battle of Britain  Beginning in August 1940  the German Luftwaffe began a series of concentrated aerial attacks  designated Unternehmen Adlerangriff or Operation Eagle Attack  on targets throughout the United Kingdom in an attempt to destroy the RAF and establish air superiority over Great Britain  The campaign later became known as the Battle of Britain  The change in emphasis of the bombing from RAF bases to bombing London  however  turned Adler into a strategic bombing operation  The effect of the switch in strategy is disputed  Some historians argue that the change in strategy lost the Luftwaffe the opportunity of winning the air battle  or air superiority  Others argue the Luftwaffe achieved little in the air battle and the RAF was not on the verge of collapse  as often claimed  Another perspective has also been put forward  which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed  Others have pointed out that it was unlikely the Luftwaffe was ever able to destroy RAF Fighter Command  If British losses became severe  the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped  It could then deploy when  or if  the Germans launched an invasion  Most historians argue Sea Lion would have failed regardless  because of the weaknesses of German sea power compared to the Royal Navy   The view of those that believed  regardless of a potential German victory in the air battle  Sea Lion was still not going to succeed included a number of German General Staff members  Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz believed air superiority was  not enough   Dönitz stated   we possessed neither control of the air or the sea  nor were we in any position to gain it   Erich Raeder  commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine in 1940 argued   When Franz Halder  the Chief of the Army General Staff  heard of the state of the Kriegsmarine  and its plan for the invasion  he noted in his diary  on 28 July 1940   If that  the plan  is true  all previous statements by the navy were so much rubbish and we can throw away the whole plan of invasion    Alfred Jodl  Chief of Operations in the OKW  Oberkommando der Wehrmacht   remarked  after Raeder said the Kriegsmarine could not meet the operational requirements of the Army   then a landing in England must be regarded as a sheer act of desperation    3 2  Limitations of the Luftwaffe  The track record of the Luftwaffe against naval combat vessels up to that point in the war was poor  In the Norwegian Campaign  despite eight weeks of continuous air supremacy  the Luftwaffe sank only two British warships  The German aircrews were not trained or equipped to attack fast moving naval targets  particularly agile naval destroyers or Motor Torpedo Boats  MTB   The Luftwaffe also lacked armour piercing bombs and had almost no aerial torpedo capability  essential for defeating larger warships  The Luftwaffe made 21 deliberate attacks on small torpedo boats during the Battle of Britain  sinking none  The British had between 700 and 800 small coastal craft  MTBs  MGBs  Motor Gun Boats  and smaller vessels   making them a critical threat if the Luftwaffe could not deal with the force  Only nine MTBs were lost to air attack out of 115 sunk by various means throughout the Second World War  Only nine destroyers were sunk by air attack in 1940  out of a force of over 100 operating in British waters at the time  Only five were sunk while evacuating Dunkirk  despite large periods of German air superiority  thousands of sorties flown  and hundreds of tons of bombs dropped  The Luftwaffe s record against merchant shipping was also not impressive  It sank only one in every 100 British vessels passing through British waters in 1940  and most of this total was achieved using mines   3 2 1  Luftwaffe Special Equipment  Had an invasion taken place  the Bf 110 equipped Erprobungsgruppe 210 would have dropped ‘Seilbomben  just prior to the landings  This was a secret weapon which would have been used to blackout the electricity network in south east England  The equipment for dropping the wires was fitted to the Bf 110 aeroplanes and tested  It involved dropping wires across high voltage wires  and was probably as dangerous to the aircraft crews as to the British   4  Navy  The most daunting problem for Germany in protecting an invasion fleet was the small size of its navy  The Kriegsmarine  already numerically far inferior to Britain s Royal Navy  had lost a sizeable portion of its large modern surface units in April 1940 during the Norwegian Campaign  either as complete losses or due to battle damage  In particular  the loss of two light cruisers and ten destroyers was crippling  as these were the very warships most suited to operating in the Channel narrows where the invasion would likely take place  Most U boats  the most powerful arm of the   were meant for destroying ships  not supporting an invasion   Although the Royal Navy could not bring to bear the whole of its naval superiority as most of the fleet was engaged in the Atlantic and Mediterranean  the British Home Fleet still had a very large advantage in numbers  It was debatable whether British ships were as vulnerable to enemy air attack as the Germans hoped  During the Dunkirk evacuation  few warships were actually sunk  despite being stationary targets  The overall disparity between the opposing naval forces made the amphibious invasion plan risky  regardless of the outcome in the air  In addition  the Kriegsmarine had allocated its few remaining larger and more modern ships to diversionary operations in the North Sea   The fleet of defeated France  one of the most powerful and modern in the world  might have tipped the balance against Britain if it had been captured by the Germans  However  the pre emptive destruction of the French fleet by the British at Mers el Kébir  and the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon two years later  ensured that this could not happen   Even if the Royal Navy had been neutralised  the chances of a successful amphibious invasion across the Channel were remote  The Germans had no specialised landing craft  and had to rely primarily on river barges to lift troops and supplies for the landing  This would have limited the quantity of artillery and tanks that could be transported and restricted operations to times of good weather  The barges were not designed for use in open sea and  even in almost perfect conditions  they would have been slow and vulnerable to attack  There were also not enough barges to transport the first invasion wave nor the following waves with their equipment  The Germans would have needed to immediately capture a port in full working order  a highly unlikely circumstance considering the strength of the British coastal defences around the south eastern harbours at that time and the likelihood the British would have demolished the docks in any port they had to withdraw from  The British also had several contingency plans  including the use of poison gas   4 1  Landing craft  In 1940 the German Navy was ill prepared for mounting an amphibious assault the size of Operation Sea Lion  Lacking purpose built landing craft and both doctrinal and practical experience with amphibious warfare  the Navy was largely starting from scratch  Some efforts had been made during the inter war years to investigate landing military forces by sea  but inadequate funding severely limited any useful progress   The Navy had taken some small steps in remedying the landing craft situation with construction of the Pionierlandungsboot 39  Engineer Landing Boat 39   a self propelled shallow draft vessel which could carry 45 infantrymen  two light vehicles or 20 tons of cargo and land on an open beach  unloading via a pair of clamshell doors at the bow  But by late September 1940 only two prototypes had been delivered   Recognising the need for an even larger craft capable of landing both tanks and infantry onto a hostile shore  the Navy began development of the 220 ton Marinefährprahm  MFP  but these too were unavailable in time for a landing on English soil in 1940  the first of them not being commissioned until April 1941   Given barely two months to assemble a large seagoing invasion fleet  the Kriegsmarine opted to convert inland river barges into makeshift landing craft  Approximately 2 400 barges were collected from throughout Europe  860 from Germany  1 200 from the Netherlands and Belgium and 350 from France   Of these  only about 800 were powered  some insufficiently   the rest had to be towed by tugs   4 1 1  Barge types  Two types of inland river barge were generally available in Europe for use in Sea Lion  the peniche  which was 38 5 metres long and carried 360 tons of cargo  and the Kampine  which was 50 metres long and carried 620 tons of cargo  Of the barges collected for the invasion  1 336 were classified as peniches and 982 as Kampinen  For simplicity’s sake  the Germans designated any barge up to the size of a standard peniche as Type A1 and anything larger as Type A2   4 1 2  Type A  Converting the assembled barges into landing craft involved cutting an opening in the bow for off loading troops and vehicles  welding longitudinal I beams and transverse braces to the hull to improve seaworthiness  adding a wooden internal ramp and pouring a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport  As modified  the Type A1 barge could accommodate three medium tanks while the Type A2 could carry four   4 1 3  Type B  This barge was a Type A altered to carry and rapidly off load the submersible tanks  Tauchpanzer  developed for use in Sea Lion  They had the advantage of being able to unload their tanks directly into water up to in depth  several hundred yards from shore  whereas the unmodified Type A had to be firmly grounded on the beach  making it more vulnerable to enemy fire  The Type B required a longer external ramp  11 metres  with a float attached to the front of it  Once the barge anchored  the crew would extend the internally stowed ramp using block and tackle sets until it was resting on the water s surface  As the first tank rolled forward onto the ramp  its weight would tilt the forward end of the ramp into the water and push it down onto the seabed  Once the tank rolled off  the ramp would bob back up to a horizontal position  ready for the next one to exit  The Navy High Command increased its initial order for 60 of these vessels to 70 in order to compensate for expected losses  A further five were ordered on 30 September as a reserve   4 1 4  Type C  The Type C barge was specifically converted to carry the Panzer II amphibious tank  Schwimmpanzer   Because of the extra width of the floats attached to this tank  cutting a broad exit ramp into the bow of the barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel s seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree  Instead  a large hatch was cut into the stern  thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore  The Type C barge could accommodate up to four Schwimmpanzers in its hold  Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September   4 1 5  Type AS  During the planning stages of Sea Lion  it was deemed desirable to provide the advanced infantry detachments  making the initial landings  with greater protection from small arms and light artillery fire by lining the sides of a Type A barge with concrete  Wooden slides were also installed along the barge’s hull to accommodate ten assault boats  Sturmboote   each capable of carrying six infantrymen and powered by a 30 hp outboard motor  The extra weight of this additional armour and equipment reduced the barge’s load capacity to 40 tons  By mid August  18 of these craft  designated Type AS  had been converted  and another five were ordered on 30 September   4 1 6  Type AF  The Luftwaffe had formed its own special command  Sonderkommando  under Major Fritz Siebel to investigate the production of landing craft for Sea Lion  Major Siebel proposed giving the unpowered Type A barges their own motive power by installing a pair of 600 hp surplus BMW aircraft engines on them driving propellers  The Navy was highly sceptical of this venture but the Army high command enthusiastically embraced the concept and Siebel proceeded with the conversions   The aircraft engines were mounted on a platform supported by iron scaffolding at the aft end of the vessel  Cooling water was stored in tanks mounted above deck  As completed  the Type AF had a speed of six knots  and a range of 60 nautical miles unless auxiliary fuel tanks were fitted  Disadvantages of this set up included an inability to back the vessel astern  limited maneuverability and the deafening noise of the engines which would have made voice commands problematic   By 1 October  128 Type A barges had been converted to airscrew propulsion and  by the end of the month  this figure had risen to over 200   The Kriegsmarine later used some of the motorized Sea Lion barges for landings on the Russian held Baltic islands in 1941 and  though most of them were eventually returned to the inland rivers they originally plied  a reserve was kept for military transport duties and for filling out amphibious flotillas   5  Army  5 1  Panzers ashore  Providing armour support for the initial wave of assault troops was a critical concern for Sea Lion planners and much effort was devoted to finding practical ways of rapidly getting tanks onto the invasion beaches  Though the Type A barges could disembark several medium tanks onto an open beach  this could be accomplished only at low tide when the barges were firmly grounded  The time needed for assembling the external ramps also meant that both the tanks and the ramp assembly crews would be exposed to close quarter enemy fire for a considerable time  A safer and faster method was needed and the Germans eventually settled on providing some tanks with floats and making others fully submersible   5 1 1  Schwimmpanzer  The Schwimmpanzer II was a modified version of the Panzer II which  at 8 9 tons  was light enough to float with the attachment of long rectangular buoyancy boxes on each side of the tank s hull  The boxes were machined from aluminium stock and filled with Kapok sacks for added buoyancy  Motive power came from the tank s own tracks which were connected by rods to a propeller shaft running through each float  The Schwimmpanzer II could make 5 7 km h in the water  An inflatable rubber hose around the turret ring created a waterproof seal between the hull and turret  The tank s 2 cm gun and coaxial machinegun were kept operational and could be fired while the tank was still making its way ashore  Because of the great width of the pontoons  Schwimmpanzer IIs were to be deployed from specially modified Type C landing barges  from which they could be launched directly into open water from a large hatch cut into the stern  The Germans converted 52 of these tanks to amphibious use prior to Sealion s cancellation   5 1 2  Tauchpanzer  The Tauchpanzer or deep wading tank  also referred to as the U Panzer or Unterwasser Panzer  was a standard Panzer III or Panzer IV medium tank with its hull made completely waterproof by sealing all sighting ports  hatches and air intakes with tape or caulk  The gap between the turret and hull was sealed with an inflatable hose while the main gun mantlet  commander’s cupola and radio operator’s machine gun were given special rubber coverings  Once the tank reached the shore  all covers and seals could be blown off via explosive cables  enabling normal combat operation   Fresh air for both the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was attached to keep one end above the water’s surface  A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge  The tank s engine was converted to be cooled with seawater  and the exhaust pipes were fitted with over pressure valves  Any water seeping into the tank s hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump  Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyro compass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge   Experiments conducted at the end of June and early July at Schilling  near Wilhelmshaven  showed that the submersible tanks functioned best when they were kept moving along the seabed as  if halted for any reason  they tended to sink into the sand  Obstacles such as underwater trenches or large rocks tended to stop the tanks in their tracks  and it was decided for this reason that they should be landed at high tide so that any mired tanks could be retrieved at low tide  Submersible tanks could operate in water up to a depth of    The Kriegsmarine initially expected to use 50 specially converted motor coasters to transport the submersible tanks  but testing with the coaster Germania showed this to be impractical  This was due to the ballast needed to offset the weight of the tanks  and the requirement that the coasters be grounded to prevent them from capsizing as the tanks were transferred by crane onto the vessel s wooden side ramps  These difficulties led to development of the Type B barge   By the end of August the Germans had converted 160 Panzer IIIs  42 Panzer IVs and 52 Panzer IIs to amphibious use  This gave them a paper strength of 254 machines  about the equivalent of an armoured division  The tanks were divided into four battalions or detachments labeled Panzer Abteilung A  B  C and D  They were to carry sufficient fuel and ammunition for a combat radius of 200 km   5 2  Specialised landing equipment  As part of a Navy competition  prototypes for a prefabricated  heavy landing bridge  or jetty  similar in function to later Allied Mulberry Harbours  were designed and built by Krupp Stahlbau and Dortmunder Union and successfully overwintered in the North Sea in 1941–42  Krupp s design won out  as it only required one day to install  as opposed to twenty eight days for the Dortmunder Union bridge  The Krupp bridge consisted of a series of 32m long connecting platforms  each supported on the seabed by four steel columns  The platforms could be raised or lowered by heavy duty winches in order to accommodate the tide  The German Navy initially ordered eight complete Krupp units composed of six platforms each  This was reduced to six units by the autumn of 1941  and eventually cancelled altogether when it became apparent that Sea Lion would never take place   In mid 1942  both the Krupp and Dortmunder prototypes were shipped to the Channel Islands and installed together off Alderney  where they were used for unloading materials needed to fortify the island  Referred to as the  German jetty  by local inhabitants  they remained standing for the next thirty six years until demolition crews finally removed them in 1978–79  a testament to their durability   The German Army developed a portable landing bridge of its own nicknamed Seeschlange  Sea Snake   This  floating roadway  was formed from a series of joined modules that could be towed into place to act as a temporary jetty  Moored ships could then either unload their cargo directly onto the roadbed or lower it down onto waiting vehicles via their heavy duty booms  The Seeschlange was successfully tested by the Army Training Unit at Le Havre in France in the autumn of 1941 and later chosen for use in Operation Herkules  the proposed Italo German invasion of Malta  It was easily transportable by rail   A specialised vehicle intended for Sea Lion was the Landwasserschlepper  LWS   an amphibious tractor under development since 1935  It was originally intended for use by Army engineers to assist with river crossings  Three of them were assigned to Tank Detachment 100 as part of the invasion  it was intended to use them for pulling ashore unpowered assault barges and towing vehicles across the beaches  They would also have been used to carry supplies directly ashore during the six hours of falling tide when the barges were grounded  This involved towing a Kässbohrer amphibious trailer capable of transporting 10–20 tons of freight behind the LWS  The LWS was demonstrated to General Halder on 2 August 1940 by the Reinhardt Trials Staff on the island of Sylt and  though he was critical of its high silhouette on land  he recognised the overall usefulness of the design  It was proposed to build enough tractors that one or two could be assigned to each invasion barge  but the late date and difficulties in mass producing the vehicle prevented this   5 3  Other equipment to be used for the first time  Operation Sealion would have been the first ever amphibious invasion by a mechanised army  and the largest amphibious invasion since Gallipoli  The Germans had to invent and improvise a lot of equipment  They also proposed to use some new weapons and use upgrades of their existing equipment for the first time  These included   New anti tank guns and ammunition  The standard German anti tank gun  the 37 mm Pak 36  was capable of penetrating the armour of all 1940 British tanks except the Matilda and Valentine  Armour piercing Ballistic capped  tungsten cored  ammunition  Pzgr  40  for 37 mm Pak 36 had become available in time for the invasion   The 37 mm Pzgr 40 would still have had trouble penetrating the Matilda II’s armour so the first echelon units replaced theirs with French or Czech 47mm guns  which weren t much better   The Pak 36 began to be replaced by the 50 mm Pak 38 in mid 1940  The Pak 38  which could penetrate a Matilda s armour  would probably have seen action first with Sealion as it would have been issued initially to the Waffen SS and the army s elite units  and all those units were in the Sealion force  These included the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler regiment  the Großdeutschland regiment  2 Mountain  2 Jäger  2 Fallschirmjäger  4 Panzer  and 2 Motorised Divisions  In addition the 7th Infantry division was considered one of the best in the Heer  and the 35th almost as good     Captured French armoured tractors  The use of these tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence on horses and probably would have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches  In addition to their proposed use on the beaches  the Germans later used them as tractors for anti tank guns and munitions carriers  as self propelled guns  and as armoured personnel carriers  There were two main types  The Renault UE Chenillette  German name  Infanterie Schlepper UE 630  f   was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940  Five to six thousand were built  and about 3 000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans  They had a storage compartment that could carry 350 kg  pull a trailer weighing 775 kg for a total of about 1000 kg  and could climb a 50% slope  The armour was 5–9 mm  enough to stop shell fragments and bullets  There was also the Lorraine 37L  which was larger  of which 360 fell into German hands  In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried  plus a 690 kg trailer pulled for a total of 1 5 tonnes  The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised  with the first wave using 9 3%  4 200  of the 45 000 horses normally required   48× Stug III Ausf B Assault Guns  7 5 cm StuK 37 L 24  50mm armour and improved suspension  Some were to be landed with the first wave   Panzer III F G upgraded with more armour on the mantlet and progressively from 3 7 cm KwK 36 L 46 5 to 5 cm KwK 38 L 42  72 Nebelwerfers  until then a secret weapon  to be landed with the second and third waves   36× Flammpanzer II flame thrower tanks  20 to land with the first wave   6  Broad versus narrow front  The German Army High Command    OKH  originally planned an invasion on a vast scale  landing over forty divisions from Dorset to Kent  This was far in excess of what the Kriegsmarine could supply  and final plans were more modest  calling for nine divisions to make an amphibious landing in Sussex and Kent with around 67 000 men in the first echelon and an airborne division to support them  The chosen invasion sites ran from Rottingdean in the west to Hythe in the east   The German Navy wanted a front as short as possible as they regarded this as more defensible  Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from Dover to Eastbourne  stressing that shipping between Cherbourg Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Navy based in Portsmouth and Plymouth  General Halder rejected this  saying   From the army s point of view I regard it as complete suicide  I might just as well put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine    The battle plan called for German forces to be launched from Cherbourg to Lyme Regis  Le Havre to Ventnor and Brighton  Boulogne to Eastbourne  Calais to Folkestone  and Dunkirk and Ostend to Ramsgate  Fallschirmjäger  paratroopers  would land near Brighton and Dover  Once the coast was secured  they would push north  taking Gloucester and encircling London  There is reason to believe that the Germans would not attempt to assault the city but besiege and bombard it  German forces would secure England up to the 52nd parallel  approximately as far north as Northampton   anticipating that the rest of the United Kingdom would then surrender   7  German coastal guns  With Germany s occupation of the Pas de Calais region in Northern France  the possibility of closing the Strait of Dover to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys by the use of land based heavy artillery became readily apparent  both to the German High Command and to Hitler  Even the Kriegsmarine’s Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal  especially given the relatively short distance    between the French and English coasts  Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast  primarily at Pas de Calais  This work was assigned to the Organisation Todt and commenced on 22 July 1940  By early August  four traversing turrets were fully operational as were all of the Army’s railway guns  Seven of these weapons  six 28 cm K5 pieces and a single K12 gun with a range of   could only be used against land targets  The remainder  thirteen 28 cm and five pieces  plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24 cm guns and ten 21 cm weapons  could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed  long loading time and ammunition types   Better suited for use against naval targets were the four heavy naval batteries installed by mid September  Friedrich August with three barrels  Prinz Heinrich with two 28 cm guns  Oldenburg with two 24 cm weapons and  largest of all  Siegfried  later renamed Batterie Todt  with a pair of guns  Fire control for these weapons was provided by both spotter aircraft and by DeTeGerät radar sets installed at Blanc Nez and Cap d’Alprech  These units were capable of detecting targets out to a range of   including small British patrol craft inshore of the English coast  Two additional radar sites were added by mid September  a DeTeGerät at Cap de la Hague and a FernDeTeGerät long range radar at Cap d’Antifer near Le Havre  To strengthen German control of the Channel narrows  the Army planned to quickly establish mobile artillery batteries along the English shoreline once a beachhead had been firmly established  Towards that end  16th Army’s Artillerie Kommand 106 was slated to land with the second wave to provide fire protection for the transport fleet as early as possible  This unit consisted of twenty four and seventy two guns  About one third of them were to be deployed on English soil by the end of Sea Lions first week   The presence of these batteries was expected to greatly reduce the threat posed by British destroyers and smaller craft along the eastern approaches as the guns would be sited to cover the main transport routes from Dover to Calais and Hastings to Boulogne  They could not entirely protect the western approaches  but a large area of those invasion zones would still be within effective range   The British military was well aware of the dangers posed by German artillery dominating the Dover Strait and on 4 September 1940 the Chief of Naval Staff issued a memo stating that if the Germans     could get possession of the Dover defile and capture its gun defences from us  then  holding these points on both sides of the Straits  they would be in a position largely to deny those waters to our naval forces   Should the Dover defile be lost  he concluded  the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel  at least by day  and he further warned that     there might really be a chance that they  the Germans  might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country   The very next day the Chiefs of Staff  after discussing the importance of the defile  decided to reinforce the Dover coast with more ground troops   The guns started to fire in the second week of August 1940 and were not silenced until 1944  when the batteries were overrun by Allied ground forces  They caused 3 059 alerts  216 civilian deaths  and damage to 10 056 premises in the Dover area  However  despite firing on frequent slow moving coastal convoys  often in broad daylight  for almost the whole of that period  there was an interlude in 1943   there is no record of any vessel being hit by them  although one seaman was killed and others were injured by shell splinters from near misses  Whatever the perceived risk  this lack of ability to hit any moving ship does not support the contention that the German coastal batteries would have been a serious threat to fast destroyers or smaller warships   8  Cancellation  Both the British and the Americans believed during the summer of 1940 that a German invasion was imminent  and studied the forthcoming high tides of 5–9 August  2–7 September  1–6 October  and 30 October 4 November as likely dates  The Germans were confident enough to film it in advance  A crew turned up at the Belgian port of Antwerp in early September 1940  For two days they filmed tanks and troops landing from barges on a nearby beach under simulated fire  It was explained that as the invasion would happen at night  Hitler wanted the German people to see all the details   On 17 September 1940  however  Hitler held a meeting with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt during which he became convinced the operation was not viable  Control of the skies was still lacking  and coordination among three branches of the armed forces was out of the question  Later that day  Hitler ordered the postponement of the operation  He ordered the dispersal of the invasion fleet in order to avert further damage by British air and naval attacks   The postponement coincided with rumours that there had been an attempt to land on British shores on or about 7 September  which had been repulsed with large German casualties  The story was later expanded to include false reports that the British had set the sea on fire using flaming oil  Both versions were widely reported in the American press and in William L  Shirer s Berlin Diary  but both were officially denied by Britain and Germany  Author James Hayward has suggested that the whispering campaign around the  failed invasion  was a successful example of British black propaganda to bolster morale at home and in occupied Europe  and convince America that Britain was not a lost cause   After the London Blitz  Hitler turned his attention to the Soviet Union  and lapsed  never to be resumed  However  not until 13 February 1942  after the invasion of Russia  were forces earmarked for the operation released to other duties   9  Chances of success  The great majority of military historians believe Operation Sea Lion had little chance of success  Kenneth Macksey asserts it would have been possible only if the Royal Navy had refrained from large scale intervention and the Germans had assaulted in July 1940  although Macksey conceded they were unprepared at that time   while others such as Peter Fleming  Derek Robinson and Stephen Bungay believe the operation would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans  Len Deighton and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a  Dunkirk in reverse   Robinson argues that the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the Kriegsmarine would have made Sea Lion a disaster   Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring  Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe  believed the invasion could not succeed and doubted whether the German air force would be able to win control of the skies  nevertheless he hoped that an early victory in the Battle of Britain would force the UK government to negotiate  without any need for an invasion  Adolf Galland  commander of fighters at the time  claimed invasion plans were not serious and that there was a palpable sense of relief in the when it was finally called off  Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt also took this view and thought that Hitler never seriously intended to invade Britain and the whole thing was a bluff to put pressure on the British government to come to terms following the Fall of France  He observed that Napoleon had failed to invade and the difficulties that confounded him did not appear to have been solved by the Sea Lion planners  In fact  in November 1939  the German Naval staff produced a study on the possibility of an invasion of Britain and concluded that it required two preconditions  air and naval superiority  neither of which Germany ever had  Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz believed air superiority was not enough and admitted   We possessed neither control of the air or the sea  nor were we in any position to gain it   Grand Admiral Erich Raeder thought it would be impossible for Germany to successfully invade the UK  he instead called for Malta and the Suez Canal to be overrun so German forces could link up with Japanese forces in the Indian Ocean to bring about the collapse of the British Empire in the Far East  and prevent the Americans from being able to use British bases if the United States entered the war   As early as 14 August 1940 Hitler had told his generals that he would not attempt to invade Britain if the task seemed too dangerous  before adding that there were other ways of defeating the UK than invading   9 1  Logistics  Four years later the Allied D Day landings showed just how much material had to be landed continuously to maintain an amphibious invasion  The problem for the Germans was worse  as the German Army was mostly horse drawn  One of its prime headaches would have been transporting thousands of horses across the Channel  British intelligence calculated that the first wave of 11 divisions  including the airborne divisions  would require a daily average of 3 300 tons of supplies  In fact in Russia in 1941  when engaged in heavy fighting  a single German infantry division required up to 1 100 tons of supplies a day  though a more usual figure would be 212 425 tons per day  British intelligence further calculated that Folkestone  the largest harbour falling within the planned German landing zones  could handle 150 tons per day in the first week of the invasion  assuming all dockside equipment was successfully demolished and regular RAF bombing raids reduced capacity by 50%   Within seven days  maximum capacity was expected to rise to 600 tons per day  once German shore parties had made repairs to the quays and cleared the harbour of any blockships and other obstacles  This meant that  at best  the nine German infantry and two airborne divisions landed initially would receive less than 20% of the 3 300 tons of supplies they required each day through a port  and would have to rely heavily on whatever could be brought in directly over the beaches or air dropped   The capture of Dover and its harbour facilities was expected to add another 800 tons per day  raising to 40% the amount of supplies brought in through ports  However  this rested on the rather unrealistic assumption of little or no interference from the Royal Navy and RAF with the German supply convoys which would have been made up of underpowered  or unpowered  i e  towed  inland waterways vessels as they shuttled slowly between the Continent to the invasion beaches and any captured harbours   9 2  Weather  From 19 to 26 September 1940  sea and wind conditions on and over the Channel where the invasion was to take place were good overall  and a crossing  even using converted river barges  was feasible provided the sea state remained at less than 4  which for the most part it did  Winds for the remainder of the month were rated as  moderate  and would not have prevented the German invasion fleet from successfully depositing the first wave troops ashore during the ten days needed to accomplish this  From the night of 27 September  strong northerly winds prevailed  making passage more hazardous  but calm conditions returned on 11–12 October and again on 16–20 October  After that  light easterly winds prevailed which would have actually assisted any invasion craft travelling from the Continent towards the invasion beaches  But by the end of October  according to British Air Ministry records  very strong south west winds  force 8  would have prohibited any non seagoing craft from risking a Channel crossing   9 3  German intelligence  At least 20 spies were sent to England by boat or parachute to gather information on the British coastal defenses under the codename  Operation Lena   many of the agents spoke limited English  All agents were quickly captured and many were convinced to defect by MI5 s Double Cross System  providing disinformation to their German superiors  It has been suggested that the  amateurish  espionage efforts were a result of deliberate sabotage by the head of the Hamburg s army intelligence bureau  Herbert Wichmann  in an effort to prevent a disastrous and costly amphibious invasion  Wichmann was critical of the Nazi regime and had close ties to Wilhelm Canaris  the former head of the Abwehr who was executed by the Nazis for treason   While some errors might not have caused problems  others  such as the inclusion of bridges that no longer existed and misunderstanding the usefulness of minor British roads  would have been detrimental to German operations  and would have added to the confusion caused by the layout of Britain s cities and the removal of road signs   9 4  Post war wargaming of the plan  In the 1974 wargame conducted at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst  which assumed the had not yet won air supremacy and continued to divert much of their efforts into bombing London  the Germans were able to establish a beachhead in south east England  However  the German ground forces were delayed at the  Stop Lines   such as the GHQ Line   a layered series of defensive positions that had been built  each a combination of Home Guard troops and physical barriers  At the same time  the regular troops of the British Army were forming up  After only a few days  the Royal Navy was able to reach the Channel from Scapa Flow  cutting off supplies and blocking further reinforcement  Isolated and facing regular troops with armour and artillery  the invasion force was forced to surrender   10  Planned occupation of Britain  10 1  Administration  According to the most detailed plans created for the planned post invasion administration  Great Britain and Ireland were to be divided into six military economic commands  with headquarters in London  Birmingham  Newcastle  Liverpool  Glasgow and Dublin  Hitler decreed that Blenheim Palace  the ancestral home of Winston Churchill  was to serve as the overall headquarters of the German occupation military government  A certain source indicates that the Germans intended to occupy Southern England only  and that draft documents existed on the regulation of the passage of British civilians back and forth between the occupied and unoccupied territories  Some Nazi planners envisaged the institution of a nationalities policy in Western Europe to secure German hegemony there  which entailed the granting of independence to various regions  In the British Isles this involved detaching Scotland from the United Kingdom  the creation of a United Ireland  and an autonomous status for Western England   The OKW  RSHA   the Reichsicherheitamt  and Foreign Ministry compiled lists of those they thought could be trusted to form a new government along the lines of that in occupied Norway  The list was headed by Oswald Mosley  The RSHA also felt that Harold Nicolson might prove useful in this role  OKW also expected to face armed civilian resistance   After the war rumours also emerged about the selection of two candidates for the  viceregal  office of Reichskommissar für Großbritannien  Reichskommissar for Great Britain   which in other occupied territories  such as Norway and the Netherlands  actually entailed the granting of near dictatorial powers to its officeholders  Josef Terboven and Arthur Seyss Inquart  respectively   The first of these was Joachim von Ribbentrop  the German Foreign Minister and previously an ambassador to Great Britain  the second was Ernst Wilhelm Bohle  an undersecretary in the Foreign Office and the Gauleiter of the NSDAP AO  However  no establishment by this name was ever approved by either Hitler or the Reich government during the Second World War  and was also denied by Bohle when he was interrogated by the victorious Allies  von Ribbentrop not having been questioned on the matter   After the Second Armistice at Compiègne with France  when he expected an imminent British capitulation  Hitler did however assure Bohle that he would be the next German ambassador to the Court of St  James s  if the British behave d  sensibly    10 2  British monarchy  A Channel 5 documentary broadcast on 16 July 2009 claimed that the Germans intended to restore Edward VIII to the throne in the event of a German occupation  Many senior Nazi officials believed the Duke of Windsor to be highly sympathetic to the Nazi government  a feeling that was reinforced by his and Wallis Simpson s 1937 visit to Germany  However  it was revealed that  despite German approaches and implications that  some harm  might come to him otherwise  the former king had willingly allowed himself to be  smuggled   at personal risk  aboard a US warship to take up his new post as Governor of the Bahamas – and therefore beyond Hitler s reach  Despite rumours  the British Foreign Office later issued a statement to the effect that   The Duke never wavered in his loyalty to Great Britain during the war    10 3  Security  Had Operation Sea Lion succeeded  under Dr  Franz Six were to follow the invasion force to Great Britain to establish the New Order  Six s headquarters were to be in London  with regional task forces in Birmingham  Liverpool  Manchester and Edinburgh  They were provided with a list  known as The Black Book  of 2 820 people to be arrested immediately  The Einsatzgruppen were also tasked with liquidating Britain s Jewish population  which numbered over 300 000  Six had also been entrusted with the task of securing  aero technological research result and important equipment  as well as  Germanic works of art   There is also a suggestion that he toyed with the idea of moving Nelson s Column to Berlin   The RSHA planned to take over the Ministry of Information  to close the major news agencies and to take control of all of the newspapers  Anti German newspapers were to be closed down   It appears  based on the German police plans  that the occupation was to be only temporary  as detailed provisions for the post occupation period are mentioned   10 4  Deportation  According to captured German documents  the commander in chief of the German Army  Walther von Brauchitsch  directed that “The able bodied male population between the ages of 17 and 45 will  unless the local situation calls for an exceptional ruling  be interned and dispatched to the Continent”  This represented about 25% of male citizens  The UK was then to be plundered for anything of financial  military  industrial or cultural value  and the remaining population terrorised  Civilian hostages would be taken  and the death penalty immediately imposed for even the most trivial acts of resistance   The deported male population would have most likely been used as industrial slave labour in areas of the Reich such as the factories and mines of the Ruhr and Upper Silesia  Although they might have been treated less brutally than slaves from the East  whom the Nazis regarded as sub humans  fit only to be worked to death   living and working conditions would still have been severe   In late February 1943 Otto Bräutigam of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories claimed he had the opportunity to read a personal report by General Eduard Wagner about a discussion with Heinrich Himmler  in which Himmler had expressed the intention to kill about 80% of the populations of France and England by special forces of the SS after the German victory  In an unrelated event  Hitler had on one occasion called the English lower classes  racially inferior    11  In fiction  There is a large corpus of works set in an alternate history where the Nazi invasion of Britain is attempted or successfully carried out   12  See also  Alien
