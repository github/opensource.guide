Louis Andriessen    born 6 June 1939  is a Dutch composer and pianist based in Amsterdam  He was a composition teacher at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague  He was recipient of the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1959   1  Life and career  Andriessen was born in Utrecht into a musical family  the son of the composer Hendrik Andriessen  1892–1981   brother of composers Jurriaan Andriessen  1925–1996  and Caecilia Andriessen  born 1931   and nephew of Willem Andriessen  1887–1964    Andriessen originally studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague  before embarking upon two years of study with Italian composer Luciano Berio in Milan and Berlin  He later joined the faculty of the Royal Conservatory   In 1969 Andriessen co founded STEIM in Amsterdam  He also helped found the instrumental groups Orkest de Volharding and Hoketus  both of which performed compositions of the same names  He later became closely involved in the ongoing Schonberg and Asko ensembles and inspired the formation of the British ensemble Icebreaker   Andriessen  a widower  was married to guitarist Jeanette Yanikian  1935–2008   They were a couple for over 40 years and were married in 1996   2  Style and notable works  Andriessen s early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends  post war serialism  Series  1958   pastiche  Anachronie I  1966–67   and tape  Il Duce  1973   His reaction to what he perceived as the conservatism of much of the Dutch contemporary music scene quickly moved him to form a radically alternative musical aesthetic of his own  Since the early 1970s he has refused to write for conventional symphony orchestras and has instead opted to write for his own idiosyncratic instrumental combinations  which often retain some traditional orchestral instruments alongside electric guitars  electric basses  and congas   Andriessen s mature music combines the influences of jazz  American minimalism  Igor Stravinsky and Claude Vivier  His harmonic writing eschews the consonant modality of much minimalism  preferring post war European dissonance  often crystallised into large blocks of sound  Large scale pieces such as De Staat   Republic    1972–76   for example  are influenced by the energy of the big band music of Count Basie and Stan Kenton and the repetitive procedures of Steve Reich  both combined with bright  clashing dissonances  Andriessen s music is thus anti Germanic and anti Romantic  and marks a departure from post war European serialism and its offshoots  He has also played a role in providing alternatives to traditional performance practice techniques  often specifying forceful  rhythmic articulations  and amplified  non vibrato  singing   Other notable works include Workers Union  1975   a melodically indeterminate piece  for any loud sounding group of instruments   Mausoleum  1979  for 2 baritones and large ensemble  De Tijd   Time    1979–81  for female singers and
