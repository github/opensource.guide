The World Health Organization  WHO  is a specialized agency of the United Nations  UN  that is concerned with international public health  It was established on 7 April 1948  headquartered in Geneva  Switzerland  WHO is a member of the United Nations Development Group  Its predecessor  the Health Organization  was an agency of the League of Nations  The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946  with the first meeting of the World Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948  It incorporated the Office International d Hygiène Publique and the League of Nations Health Organization  Since its creation  it has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox  Its current priorities include communicable diseases  in particular  HIV AIDS  Ebola  malaria and tuberculosis  the mitigation of the effects of non communicable diseases  sexual and reproductive health  development  and aging  nutrition  food security and healthy eating  occupational health  substance abuse  and drive the development of reporting  publications  and networking  WHO is responsible for the World Health Report  a leading international publication on health  the worldwide World Health Survey  and World Health Day  7 April of every year    1  History  1 1  Establishment  During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization  Dr  Szeming Sze  a delegate from China  conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations  After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject  Alger Hiss  the Secretary General of the conference  recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization  Dr  Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health  The use of the word  world   rather than  international  emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve  The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations  and by 10 other countries  on 22 July 1946  It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed  Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948  when it was ratified by the 26th member state  The first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948  having secured a budget of US$5 million  then GBP£1 250 000  for the 1949 year  Andrija Stampar was the Assembly s first president  and G  Brock Chisholm was appointed Director General of WHO  having served as Executive Secretary during the planning stages  Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria  tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections  and to improve maternal and child health  nutrition and environmental hygiene  Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease  The logo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a symbol for healing   1 2  Operational history  WHO established an epidemiological information service via telex in 1947  and by 1950 a mass tuberculosis inoculation drive  using the BCG vaccine  was under way  In 1955  the malaria eradication programme was launched  although it was later altered in objective  1965 saw the first report on diabetes mellitus and the creation of the International Agency for Research on Cancer  WHO moved into its headquarters building in 1966  The Expanded Programme on Immunization was started in 1974  as was the control programme into onchocerciasis – an important partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization  FAO   the United Nations Development Programme  UNDP   and World Bank  In the following year  the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases was also launched  In 1976  the World Health Assembly voted to enact a resolution on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation  with a focus on community driven care  The first list of essential medicines was drawn up in 1977  and a year later the ambitious goal of  health for all  was declared  In 1986  WHO started its global programme on the growing problem of HIV AIDS  followed two years later by additional attention on preventing discrimination against sufferers and UNAIDS was formed in 1996  The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established in 1988   In 1958  Viktor Zhdanov  Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR  called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox  resulting in Resolution WHA11 54  At this point  2 million people were dying from smallpox every year  In 1967  the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2 4 million annually to the effort and adopted a new disease surveillance method  The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases  WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities  The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972  After over two decades of fighting smallpox  the WHO declared in 1979 that the disease had been eradicated – the first disease in history to be eliminated by human effort   In 1998  WHO s Director General highlighted gains in child survival  reduced infant mortality  raised life expectancy and reduced rates of  scourges  such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO s founding  He  did  however  accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow  Cholera and malaria have remained problems since WHO s founding  although in decline for a large part of that period  In the twenty first century  the Stop TB Partnership was created in 2000  along with the UN s formulation of the Millennium Development Goals  The Measles initiative was formed in 2001  and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007  In 2002  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available  In 2006  the organization endorsed the world s first official HIV AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe  which formed the basis for a global prevention  treatment and support plan to fight the AIDS pandemic   1 3  Overall focus  The WHO s Constitution states that its objective  is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health    WHO fulfils its objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution   a  to act as the directing and co ordinating authority on international health work   b  to establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations  specialized agencies  governmental health administrations  professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate   c  to assist Governments  upon request  in strengthening health services   d  to furnish appropriate technical assistance and  in emergencies  necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments   e  to provide or assist in providing  upon the request of the United Nations  health services and facilities to special groups  such as the peoples of trust territories   f  to establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required  including epidemiological and statistical services   g  to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic  endemic and other diseases   h  to promote  in co operation with other specialized agencies where necessary  the prevention of accidental injuries   i  to promote  in co operation with other specialized agencies where necessary  the improvement of nutrition  housing  sanitation  recreation  economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene   j  to promote co operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health   k  to propose conventions  agreements and regulations  and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform   WHO currently defines its role in public health as follows   providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed   shaping the research agenda and stimulating the generation  translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge   setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation   articulating ethical and evidence based policy options   providing technical support  catalyzing change  and building sustainable institutional capacity  and  monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends   1 4  Communicable diseases  The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 13 areas among which funding was distributed  Two of those thirteen areas related to communicable diseases  the first  to reduce the  health  social and economic burden  of communicable diseases in general  the second to combat HIV AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis in particular   In terms of HIV AIDS  WHO works within the UNAIDS network and considers it important that it works in alignment with UNAIDS objectives and strategies  It also strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of the disease  In line with UNAIDS  WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%  reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%  and reducing HIV related deaths by 25%   Although WHO dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign in the 1970s as too ambitious  it retains a strong commitment to malaria control  WHO s Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases  and future problems in malaria control schemes  WHO is to report  likely in 2015  as to whether RTS S AS01  currently in research  is a viable malaria vaccine  For the time being  insecticide treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria  as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children   WHO s help has contributed to a 40% fall in the number of deaths from tuberculosis between 1990 and 2010  and since 2005  it claims that over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7 million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO  These include engaging national governments and their financing  early diagnosis  standardising treatment  monitoring of the spread and impact of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply  It has also recognised the vulnerability of victims of HIV AIDS to tuberculosis   WHO aims to eradicate polio  It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988  which partnered WHO with Rotary International  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the United Nations Children s Fund  UNICEF   as well as smaller organizations  It works to immunize young children and prevent the re emergence of cases in countries declared  polio free    1 5  Non communicable diseases  mental health and injuries  Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of  disease  disability and premature deaths from chronic noncommunicable diseases  mental disorders  violence and injuries  and visual impairment    For example  the WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic related injuries   WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery  including emergency and essential surgical care  trauma care  and safe surgery  The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety   1 6  Life course and life style  WHO works to  reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life  including pregnancy  childbirth  the neonatal period  childhood and adolescence  and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals    It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for  health conditions associated with use of tobacco  alcohol  drugs and other psychoactive substances  unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and unsafe sex    WHO works to improve nutrition  food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development   1 7  Emergency work  When any sort of disaster or emergency occurs  it is WHO s stated objective to reduce any consequences the event may have on world health and its social and economic implications   On 5 May 2014  WHO announced that the spread of polio is a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia  Africa and the Middle East are considered  extraordinary    On 8 August 2014  WHO declared that the spread of Ebola is a public health emergency  an outbreak which is believed to have started in Guinea  has spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone  The situation in West Africa is considered very serious   1 8  Health policy  WHO addresses government health policy with two aims  firstly   to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro poor  gender responsive  and human rights based approaches  and secondly  to promote a healthier environment  intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health    The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence based tools  norms and standards to support member states to inform health policy options  It oversees the implementation of the International Health Regulations  and publishes a series of medical classifications  of these  three are overreaching  reference classifications   the International Statistical Classification of Diseases  ICD   the International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health  ICF  and the International Classification of Health Interventions  ICHI   Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast milk Substitutes  adopted in 1981   Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  adopted in 2003  and the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  adopted in 2010    In terms of health services  WHO looks to improve  governance  financing  staffing and management  and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy making  It also strives to  ensure improved access  quality and use of medical products and technologies    1 9  Governance and support  The remaining two of WHO s thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself    to provide leadership  strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries  the United Nations system  and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda   and   to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible  learning organization  enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively    1 9 1  Partnerships  The WHO along with the World Bank constitute the core team responsible for administering the International Health Partnership  IHP+   The IHP+ is a group of partner governments  development agencies  civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries  Partners work together to put international principles for aid effectiveness and development cooperation into practice in the health sector   The organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work  such as the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization  the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy  and the WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education & Collaborative Practice   WHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research  targeted at improving health policy and systems   WHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the HINARI network   1 9 2  Public health education and action  Each year  the organization marks World Health Day and other observances focusing on a specific health promotion topic  World Health Day falls on 7 April each year  timed to match the anniversary of WHO s founding  Recent themes have been vector borne diseases  2014   healthy ageing  2012  and drug resistance  2011    The other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are World Tuberculosis Day  World Immunization Week  World Malaria Day  World No Tobacco Day  World Blood Donor Day  World Hepatitis Day  and World AIDS Day   As part of the United Nations  the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals  Of the eight Millennium Development Goals  three – reducing child mortality by two thirds  to reduce maternal deaths by three quarters  and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV AIDS – relate directly to WHO s scope  the other five inter relate and have an impact on world health   1 10  Data handling and publications  The World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms  including the World Health Survey covering almost 400 000 respondents from 70 countries  and the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health  SAGE  covering over 50 000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries  The Country Health Intelligence Portal  CHIP   has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries  The information gathered in this portal is utilized by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans  implement  monitor  and evaluate it   The WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national health systems and health workforces  The Global Health Observatory  GHO  has been the WHO s main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe   The WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems  WHO AIMS   the WHO Quality of Life Instrument  WHOQOL   and the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment  SARA  provide guidance for data collection  Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies  such as through the Health Metrics Network  also aim to provide sufficient high quality information to assist governmental decision making  WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs  including through the Evidence Informed Policy Network  EVIPNet   The Pan American Health Organization  PAHO AMRO  became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009   On 10 December 2013  a new WHO database  known as MiNDbank  went online  The database was launched on Human Rights Day  and is part of WHO s QualityRights initiative  which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions  The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health  substance abuse  disability  human rights  and the different policies  strategies  laws  and service standards being implemented in different countries  It also contains important international documents and information  The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners  Users can review policies  laws  and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health   The WHO regularly publishes a World Health Report  its leading publication  including an expert assessment of a specific global health topic  Other publications of WHO include the Bulletin of the World Health Organization  the Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal  overseen by EMRO   the Human Resources for Health  published in collaboration with BioMed Central   and the Pan American Journal of Public Health  overseen by PAHO AMRO    2  Structure  The World Health Organization is a member of the United Nations Development Group   2 1  Membership    the WHO has 194 member states  all Member States of the United Nations except Liechtenstein  as well as the Cook Islands and Niue   A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization     it also had two associate members  Puerto Rico and Tokelau  Several other entities have been granted observer status  Palestine is an observer as a  national liberation movement  recognised by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118  The Holy See also attends as an observer  as does the Order of Malta  In 2010  Taiwan was invited under the name of  Chinese Taipei    WHO Member States appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly  WHO s supreme decision making body  All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership  and  according to the WHO web site   other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly    In addition  the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into  official relations  with WHO and are invited as observers  In the World Health Assembly they are seated alongside the other NGOs   2 2  Assembly and Executive Board  The World Health Assembly is the legislative and supreme body of WHO  Based in Geneva  it typically meets yearly in May  It appoints the Director General every five years  and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO  including the proposed budget  It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination  The Assembly elects 34 members  technically qualified in the field of health  to the Executive Board for three year terms  The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly  to advise it and to facilitate its work   2 3  Regional offices  The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952  and are based on article 44 of WHO s constitution  which allowed the WHA to  establish a  single  regional organization to meet the special needs of  each defined  area   Many decisions are made at regional level  including important discussions over WHO s budget  and in deciding the members of the next assembly  which are designated by the regions   Each region has a Regional Committee  which generally meets once a year  normally in the autumn  Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region  including those states that are not fully recognised  For example  Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional office  Each region also has a regional office  Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director  who is elected by the Regional Committee  The Board must approve such appointments  although as of 2004  it had never overruled the preference of a regional committee  The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate  but the practical effect has always been small  Since 1999  Regional Directors serve for a once renewable five year term   Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads  in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region  Aside from electing the Regional Director  the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation  within the region  of the health and other policies adopted by the World Health Assembly  The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region   The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region  The RD manages and or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centers  The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director General—of all the heads of WHO country offices  known as WHO Representatives  within the Region   2 4  People  The head of the organization is the Director General  elected by the World Health Assembly  The current Director General is Margaret Chan  who was first appointed on 9 November 2006 and confirmed for a second term until the end of June 2017   WHO employs 8 500 people in 147 countries  In support of the principle of a tobacco free work environment the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers  The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003   The WHO operates  Goodwill Ambassadors   members of the arts  sport or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO s initiatives and projects  There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors  Jet Li  Nancy Brinker  Peng Liyuan  Yohei Sasakawa and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra  and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project  Craig David    2 5  Country and liaison offices  The World Health Organization operates 147 country offices in all its regions  It also operates several liaison offices  including those with the European Union  United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  It also operates the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon  France  and the WHO Centre for Health Development in Kobe  Japan  Additional offices include those in Pristina  the West Bank and Gaza  the US Mexico Border Field Office in El Paso  the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados  and Northern Micronesia office  There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital  occasionally accompanied by satellite offices in the provinces or sub regions of the country in question   The country office is headed by a WHO Representative  WR     the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya   Libya    all other staff were international  Those in the Region for the Americas  they are referred to as PAHO WHO Representatives  In Europe  WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office  and are nationals with the exception of Serbia  there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania  the Russian Federation  Tajikistan  Turkey  and Uzbekistan  The WR is member of the UN system country team which is coordinated by the UN System Resident Coordinator   The country office consists of the WR  and several health and other experts  both foreign and local  as well as the necessary support staff  The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country s government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies   2 6  Financing and partnerships  The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors    the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States  $110 million   Japan  $58 million   Germany  $37 million   United Kingdom  $31 million  and France  $31 million   The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3 959 million  of which $944 million  24%  will come from assessed contributions  This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget  adjusting to take account of previous underspends  Assessed contributions were kept the same  Voluntary contributions will account for $3 015 million  76%   of which $800 million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding  with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives   In recent years  the WHO s work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies    a total of 473 NGOs had some form of partnership with WHO  There were 189 partnerships with international non governmental organization  NGO  in formal  official relations  – the rest being considered informal in character  Partners include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation   3  Controversies  3 1  IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40  In 1959  the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA   The agreement states that the WHO recognises the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health  However  the following paragraph adds   whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest  the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement   The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists  including Women in Europe for a Common Future  to believe that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the use of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima  They believe WHO must regain what they see as  independence    3 2  Roman Catholic Church and AIDS  In 2003  the WHO denounced the Roman Curia s health department s opposition to the use of condoms  saying   These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people  and currently affects at least 42 million     the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV AIDS  At the time  the World Health Assembly President  Guyana s Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy  condemned Pope Benedict s opposition to contraception  saying he was trying to  create confusion  and  impede  proven strategies in the battle against the disease   3 3  Intermittent preventive therapy  The aggressive support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for intermittent preventive therapy of malaria triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi   3 4  Diet and sugar intake  Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people s lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial  as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic non communicable disease  which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a healthy diet  This report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation  to which the WHO FAO responded by including in the report the statement  The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial   but also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies  In 2014  WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half  saying that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet   3 5  2009 Swine Flu pandemic  In 2007  the WHO organized work on pandemic influenza vaccine development through clinical trials in collaboration with many experts  A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by Director General Margaret Chan in April 2009   By the post pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger  spreading  fear and confusion  rather than  immediate information   Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to  unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities  scientists and manufacturers  resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken  with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration  This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken in during the last decade    4  World headquarters  The seat of the organization is in Geneva  Switzerland  It was dedicated and opened in 1966   4 1  Early views  4 2  Views 2013  5  Name in other languages  منظمة الصحة العالمية  世界卫生组织  Shìjiè wèishēng zǔzhī   Organisation mondiale de la santé  Всемирная
