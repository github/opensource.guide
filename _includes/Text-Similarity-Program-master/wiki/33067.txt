A white elephant is a possession which its owner cannot dispose of and whose cost  particularly that of maintenance  is out of proportion to its usefulness  The term derives from the story that the kings of Siam  now Thailand  were accustomed to make a present of one of these animals to courtiers who had rendered themselves obnoxious in order to ruin the recipient by the cost of its maintenance  In modern usage  it is an object  scheme  business venture  facility  etc   considered without use or value   1  Background  The term derives from the sacred white elephants kept by Southeast Asian monarchs in Burma  Thailand  Laos and Cambodia  To possess a white elephant was regarded  and is still regarded in Thailand and Burma  as a sign that the monarch reigned with justice and power  and that the kingdom was blessed with peace and prosperity  The opulence expected of anyone that owned a beast of such stature was great  Monarchs often exemplified their possession of white elephants in their formal titles  e g   Hsinbyushin  lit   Lord of the White Elephant  and the third monarch of the Konbaung dynasty    White elephants are linked to Hindu cosmology as the mount of Indra  king of the Vedic deities  is Airavata  a white elephant  White elephants are also intricately linked to Buddhist cosmology  the mount of Sakka s  a Buddhist deity and ruler of the Tavatimsa heaven  is a three headed white elephant named Airavata  Albino elephants exist in nature  usually being reddish brown or pink   The tradition derives from tales that associate a white elephant with the birth of the Buddha  as his mother was reputed to have dreamed of a white elephant presenting her with a lotus flower  a common symbol of wisdom and purity  on the eve of giving birth  Because the animals were considered sacred and laws protected them from labor  receiving a gift of a white elephant from a monarch was simultaneously a blessing and a curse  It was a blessing because the animal was sacred and a sign of the monarch s favour  and a curse because the recipient now had an expensive to maintain animal he could not give away and could not put to much practical use   The Order of the White Elephant consists of eight grades of medals issued by the government of Thailand  There are also white elephants in Nepal   In the West  the term  white elephant  relating to an expensive burden that fails to meet expectations  was popularized following P  T  Barnum s experience with an elephant named Toung Taloung that he billed as the  Sacred White Elephant of Burma   After much effort and great expense  Barnum finally acquired the animal from the King of Siam only to discover that his  white elephant  was actually dirty grey in color with a few pink spots   The expressions  white elephant  and  gift of a white elephant  came into common use in the middle of the nineteenth century  The phrase was attached to  white elephant swaps  and  white elephant sales  in the early twentieth century  Many church bazaars held “white elephant sales” where donors could unload unwanted bric a brac  generating profit from the phenomenon that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure  Many organizational and church fairs still use the term today  In general use a “white elephant” usually refers to an item that’s not useful  decorative  but may be expensive and odd   2  Alleged white elephant projects  Crazy Horse Memorial  A colossal statue of Oglala warrior Tȟašúŋke Witkó  Crazy Horse  pointing and mounted on a horse was commissioned by Lakota elder Henry Standing Bear as a memorial to Crazy Horse and the Lakota people who disapproved of Mt  Rushmore as four non native faces peering over his ancestral land  The project is opposed by several leaders in the Oglala community   Several airports built in Spain are considered as white elephants  Ciudad Real Airport  just south of Madrid  has been described as the worst example of the many white elephants in that area  It promised 6000 new jobs and a boom for the local economy  but closed in 2012  only four years after opening  In a similar situation are the Castellón Costa Azahar Airport north of Valencia and the Huesca Pirineos Airport  both currently have no scheduled commercial flights   Kangbashi New Area  Ordos City  China   The New South China Mall was the largest mall in the world  conceived to accommodate 100 000 visitors a day   The West Edmonton Mall was once the largest mall in the world  and faced a lawsuit by Disney over the use of the name Fantasyland   The U S  Navy s s were described as  white elephants  because the  tactical and strategic concepts that inspired them were completely outmoded  by the time they were commissioned – the Japanese heavy cruisers that they were designed to hunt down had already been destroyed   The World War II Japanese battleship IJN Yamato was described as a white elephant due to it being an outdated tactical and strategic concept  The primary naval warship had become the aircraft carrier rather than the battleship   Bristol Brabazon     a ship designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel  She was the largest ship ever built at the time of her launch in 1858  and had the capacity to carry 4 000 passengers around the world without refuelling  but was not a commercial success  Her hold was later gutted and converted to lay the successful 1865 transatlantic telegraph cable  an impossible task for a smaller vessel   The Thai aircraft carrier has been criticized as having been built for nationalist reasons rather than applicable military uses  It has spent little time at sea since being commissioned in 1997  the year of the Asian financial crisis  due to her high operating costs   Hughes H 4 Hercules  or  Spruce Goose    often called Howard Hughes  white elephant before and during the Senate War Investigating Committee  Hughes  associate Noah Dietrich called it a  plywood white elephant    Lambert St  Louis International Airport runway 11 29 was conceived on the basis of traffic projections made in the 1980s and 1990s that warned of impending strains on the airport and the national air traffic system as a result of predicted growth in traffic at the airport  The $1 billion runway expansion was designed in part to allow for simultaneous operations on parallel runways in bad weather  Construction began in 1998  and continued even after traffic at the airport declined following the September 11 attacks in 2001  the purchase of Trans World Airlines by American Airlines in April 2001  and subsequent cuts in flights to the airport by American Airlines in 2003  The project required the relocation of seven major roads and the demolition of approximately 2 000 homes in Bridgeton  Missouri  Intended to provide superfluous extra capacity for flight operations at the airport  use of the runway is shunned by fuel conscious pilots and airlines due to its distance from the terminals  Even one of the airport commissioners  John Krekeler  deemed the project a  white elephant    The Millennium Dome in London  built at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds in Greenwich in London to celebrate the millennium  was commonly termed a white elephant  The exhibition it housed was less successful than hoped and the widely criticised building struggled to find a role after the event  It is now The O2  an arena and entertainment centre   Christ s Hospital railway station was constructed at great expense in 1902 to accommodate Christ s Hospital school  a large independent school that had relocated from London to the West Sussex countryside  The station had seven platforms and a magnificent terminal building  It was envisaged that the station would be busy due to the 850 pupils regularly using it  and also the foreseen westward expansion of the nearby town of Horsham  It was also the meeting point of three separate railway lines  However  the railway company did not realise that the school is a boarding school  so the station is only used by large numbers of pupils a handful of times per year  and the development of Horsham did not materialise  Two of the railway lines also closed down in the 1960s as a result of the Beeching Axe  and the station now has two remaining platforms  one northbound to London Victoria  one southbound to Portsmouth   and one train per hour in each direction   Montréal Mirabel International Airport is North America s largest airport  but has been abandoned as a passenger airport due to its awkward location and lack of traffic  The name of the project s most notable supporter Pierre Elliott Trudeau was subsequently used for Dorval Airport  which Mirabel was intended to replace   The Philadelphia Athletics baseball team was referred to as a

bol de toilette  has also been applied as a pejorative   The Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang  North Korea  designed as the world s tallest hotel  began construction in 1987  Due to financial difficulties  construction ceased prematurely in 1992  Since then  the structure has remained as an unoccupied hulk  Construction resumed in April 2008   Ada programming language  commissioned by the United States Department of Defense  DoD   It was designed to be a single  standard language  particularly suitable for embedded and real time systems  The DoD mandated the use of Ada for many software projects in 1987  but removed the requirement in 1997  It is still used in many countries  especially for safety critical systems such as air traffic control and subways  It came to be known as the  Green Elephant  for the color code used to keep contract selection unbiased  It became irrelevant for commercial applications  barely surviving the wave of free and successful tools such as C++ and Java  The introduction of the GNAT compiler and the Ada 95 and 2005 standards has to some extent mitigated the cost   Several incomplete or badly functioning dams  such as the Bujagali dam  Uganda  and Epupa dam  Angola   Most were constructed by foreign companies in the interest of foreign aid  Although the buildings do not meet expectations  if construction is completed or restarted  they could still provide a contribution to the local population   In 1907  author Henry James described the mansions in Newport  Rhode Island  USA as being  white elephants  and  witless dreams  because they were summer homes for the wealthy and were unoccupied for most of the year  Thorstein Veblen invented the term conspicuous consumption to describe the mansions   The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway  CGB   a public transit project in East Anglia  whose high construction costs far exceed even the most optimistic projections of revenue  Because the 50 000 tons of concrete used to build the busway is itself white  the project is often referred to as a white elephant   Brisbane  Australia s Clem Jones Tunnel  The operating company Rivercity motorways posted a A$1 67 billion loss in 2010  largely due to overly optimistic traffic projections  Despite cutting tolls by up to 50% traffic volumes are less than half of the projected 60 000 vehicles a day   The stadiums built in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World Cup have been dubbed  white elephants   citing a massive misappropriation of national funds to provide a spectacle for the sporting event that might have been directed toward the country s staggering poverty   The F 35 Joint Strike Fighter is being increasingly viewed as a  white elephant  by the U S  military  due to its price of $380 billion for nearly 2 500 aircraft in three differing versions  to equip nine nations  air forces  along with lower performance than originally anticipated  Airplane designer Pierre Sprey is highly critical of the project calling the plane too un maneuverable to be a dogfighter  too slow to be an interceptor  too small to be a bomber and it can t loiter over a battlefield for hours at a time to provide close air support  The lifetime cost of the F 35 program has since been estimated by the Pentagon at $1 45 trillion   The National Ignition Facility  a laser fusion research facility in the United States  has been described by opponents as a white elephant  The total cost for development and construction of the research facility was $3 54 billion  A common joke among opponents of the facility is that  the technology is always 20 years away   Proponents point out that fusion is the holy grail of energy science and that the research wouldn t be a grand challenge if scientists knew in advance when fusion would be achieved in a laboratory  Public perception aside  the primary mission of the National Ignition Facility is actually to help ensure the safety and reliability of the U S  nuclear stockpile without underground testing  In this capacity  it serves as the keystone research facility for the Stockpile Stewardship program   The Temple of Olympian Zeus in ancient Greece was intended to be the biggest temple of its time  but due to its high construction costs and human power demands  the temple remain unfinished for many centuries  Its construction was finally completed during the Roman times 638 years after the project had begun   The Sagrada Família church in Barcelona has been viewed for many years as a monumental white elephant  The construction started in 1882 and until today the church still remains under construction  The lack of funds  the death of the architect Antoni Gaudí  the Spanish Civil War and the complexity of the project led to delays and interruptions over the years  Completion is not expected until at least 2026  although it functions as a church and tourist attraction in the meantime   The Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest  Romania was built by dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu as the world s second largest building  second to The Pentagon   After the 1989 overthrow  the cost of demolishing the palace would have been higher than the cost of finishing it

meeting that took place in 2012  The bridge connects the mainland part of Vladivostok with the meeting venue on Russky Island  The world s then longest cable stayed bridge terminates in a dead end on the island – whose population of 5 000 lack access to telephones  public lighting and mains water – and was completed at a cost believed to have exceeded $1 billion USD  the total bill has not been published   Maryland Route 200  whose cost in 2013 exceeded $2 5 billion  was funded through infrastructure bonds and the debt was expected to be paid off from tolls collected  The highway witnessed less than half traffic and revenue projected and had little impact in easing the capital area traffic congestion  Higher toll rates could cause even lesser usage  and the cost of the project is unlikely to be fully recouped from tolls  Consequently  the MTA raised tolls to in other locations to compensate  which caused an outcry from many citizens   The Diözesanzentrum  Diocesan Centre St  Nicholas  in Limburg  Germany  In 2013  Franz Peter Tebartz van Elst  the ex bishop of the Limburg Diocese  renovated a luxurious Bishopric of Limburg  The compound was renovated at a cost of €31M several times what was originally planned for  Elst  was in the habit of extravagant tastes  despite him preaching to the contrary that they should live modestly  His congregation nicknamed him the  Bishop of Bling  and the  luxury Bishop  to express their frustrations with the double standards  The compound was nicknamed pejoratively as the Kabba of Limburg  so named for an obsidian colored rectangular chapel centrally within the complex  The complex is equipped with a private garden costing €783K  private residences with a bathtub costing €15K  a diocese museum  the Kabba like chapel  An fitness room was planned  as well other unconfirmed facilities such as a sauna and wine cellar  City officials were denied permission to inspect the residence and confirm the rumors  also the construction crew vowed secrecy  Expensive materials were used in its construction and interior decorations such as $600K for artwork and $474K for carpentry and cabinets  Funding for the residence took a toll on the Limburg diocese  programs such as day care and maintenance overhead were denied funding  Elst never resided in his new residence as he was removed from his position as Bishop of

first planned in the early 1960s  Due to skyrocketing costs and numerous delays  with trackage costs alone estimated at $100 000 per foot   construction was only made as far as 21st Street – Queensbridge by the time it opened in 1989  For twelve years  the three station 63rd Street Line was known as the  tunnel to nowhere   as it stub ended just a couple hundred feet west of the IND Queens Boulevard Line  a very busy subway line  and did nothing to alleviate congestion on the latter line  In 1984  usage estimates for the mostly two tracked  $530 million line were 220 passengers an hour  A useful connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line was opened in 2001   3  See also  Bridge to nowhere  Pork barrel  4  References  de Weißer Elefant#Redewendung
