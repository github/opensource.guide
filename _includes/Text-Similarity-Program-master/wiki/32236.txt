An urban heat island  UHI  is a metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities  The phenomenon was first investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s  although he was not the one to name the phenomenon  The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day  and is most apparent when winds are weak  UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter  The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces  which use materials that effectively store short wave radiation  Waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor  As a population center grows  it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature  The less used term heat island refers to any area  populated or not  which is consistently hotter than the surrounding area   Monthly rainfall is greater downwind of cities  partially due to the UHI  Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons  and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes  The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone  and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems   Not all cities have a distinct urban heat island  Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of green roofs and the use of lighter colored surfaces in urban areas  which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat   Despite concerns raised about its possible contribution to global warming  comparisons between urban and rural areas show that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends   1  Causes  There are several causes of an urban heat island  UHI   The principal reason for the nighttime warming is that the short wave radiation is still within the concrete  asphalt  and buildings that was absorbed during the day  unlike suburban and rural areas  This energy is then slowly released during the night as long wave radiation  making cooling a slow process  Two other reasons are changes in the thermal properties of surface materials and lack of evapotranspiration  for example through lack of vegetation  in urban areas  With a decreased amount of vegetation  cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees  the low albedo of their leaves  and the removal of carbon dioxide  Materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs  such as concrete and asphalt  have significantly different thermal bulk properties  including heat capacity and thermal conductivity  and surface radiative properties  albedo and emissivity  than the surrounding rural areas  This causes a change in the energy balance of the urban area  often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas   Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects  The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight  increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated  This is called the  urban canyon effect   Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind  which also inhibits cooling by convection and pollution from dissipating  Waste heat from automobiles  air conditioning  industry  and other sources also contributes to the UHI  High levels of pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI  as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere  As UHI raises the temperature of cities  it will also increase the concentration of ozone in the air  which is a greenhouse gas  Ozone concentrations will increase because it is a secondary gas  aided by an increase in temperature and sunlight   Some cities exhibit a heat island effect  largest at night  Seasonally  UHI shows up both in summer and winter  The typical temperature difference is several degrees between the center of the city and surrounding fields  The difference in temperature between an inner city and its surrounding suburbs is frequently mentioned in weather reports  as in   downtown  in the suburbs   Black surfaces absorb significantly more electromagnetic radiation  and causes the surfaces of asphalt roads and highways to heat   The annual mean air temperature of a city with 1 million people or more can be warmer than its surroundings  In the evening  the difference can be as high as     2  Diurnal behavior  The IPCC stated that  it is well known that compared to non urban areas urban heat islands raise night time temperatures more than daytime temperatures   For example  Barcelona  Spain is 0 2 °C cooler for daily maxima and 2 9 °C warmer for minima than a nearby rural station  A description of the very first report of the UHI by Luke Howard in the late 1810s said that the urban center of London was warmer at night than the surrounding countryside by 3 7 °F   Though the warmer air temperature within the UHI is generally most apparent at night  urban heat islands exhibit significant and somewhat paradoxical diurnal behavior  The air temperature difference between the UHI and the surrounding environment is large at night and small during the day  The opposite is true for skin temperatures of the urban landscape within the UHI   Throughout the daytime  particularly when the skies are free of clouds  urban surfaces are warmed by the absorption of solar radiation  Surfaces in the urban areas tend to warm faster than those of the surrounding rural areas  By virtue of their high heat capacities  urban surfaces act as a giant reservoir of heat energy  For example  concrete can hold roughly 2 000 times as much heat as an equivalent volume of air  As a result  the large daytime surface temperature within the UHI is easily seen via thermal remote sensing  As is often the case with daytime heating  this warming also has the effect of generating convective winds within the urban boundary layer  It is theorized that  due to the atmospheric mixing that results  the air temperature perturbation within the UHI is generally minimal or nonexistent during the day  though the surface temperatures can reach extremely high levels   At night  the situation reverses  The absence of solar heating causes the atmospheric convection to decrease  and the urban boundary layer begins to stabilize  If enough stabilization occurs  an inversion layer is formed  This traps urban air near the surface  and keeping surface air warm from the still warm urban surfaces  forming the nighttime warmer air temperatures within the UHI  Other than the heat retention properties of urban areas  the nighttime maximum in urban canyons could also be due to the blocking of  sky view  during cooling  surfaces lose heat at night principally by radiation to the comparatively cool sky  and this is blocked by the buildings in an urban area  Radiative cooling is more dominant when wind speed is low and the sky is cloudless  and indeed the UHI is found to be largest at night in these conditions   3  Predicting the UHI  If a city or town has a good system of taking weather observations the UHI can be measured directly  An alternative is to use a complex simulation of the location to calculate the UHI  or to use an approximate empirical method Such models than allow the UHI to be included in estimates of future temperatures rises within cities due to climate change   Professor Leonard O  Myrup  University of California at Davis  developed and published in 1969 the first comprehensive numerical treatment to predict the effects of the urban heat island  UHI   His paper published in the American Meteorological Society s Journal of Applied Meteorology surveys UHI and criticizes then existing theories as being excessively qualitative  A general purpose  numerical energy budget model is described and applied to the urban atmosphere  Calculations for several special cases as well as a sensitivity analysis are presented  The model is found to predict the correct order of magnitude of the urban temperature excess  The heat island effect is found to be the net result of several competing physical processes  In general  reduced evaporation in the city center and the thermal properties of the city building and paving materials are the dominant parameters  It is suggested that such a model could be used in engineering calculations to improve the climate of existing and future cities   4  Impact on animals  Ant colonies in urban heat islands have an increased heat tolerance at no cost to cold tolerance   Species that are good at colonizing can utilize conditions provided by urban heat islands to thrive in regions outside of their normal range  Examples of this include Grey headed Flying Fox  Pteropus Poliocephalus  and the Common House Gecko  Grey headed Flying Fox  found in Melbourne Australia  colonized urban habitats following increase in temperatures there  Increased temperatures  causing warmer winter conditions  made the city more similar in climate to the more northerly wildland habitat of the species   With attempts to mitigate and manage urban heat islands  Temperature changes and availability of food and water are reduced  With temperate climates  urban heat islands will extend the growing season  therefore altering breeding strategies of inhabiting species  This can be seen the best in the effects that urban heat islands have on water temperature  With the temperature of the nearby buildings sometimes reaching over 50 degrees different from the near surface air temperature  precipitation will warm rapidly  causing runoff into nearby streams  lakes and rivers  or other bodies of water  to provide excessive thermal pollution  The increase in the thermal pollution has the ability to increase water temperature by 20 to 30 degrees  This increase will cause the fish species inhabiting the body of water to undergo thermal stress and shock due to the rapid change in temperature to their climate   Urban heat islands caused by cities have altered the natural selection process  Selective pressures like temporal variation in food  predation and water are relaxed causing for a new set of selective forces to roll out  For example  within urban habitats  insects are more abundant than in rural areas  Insects are Ectotherms  This means that they depend on the temperature of the environment to control their body temperature  making for the warmer climates of the city perfect for their ability to thrive  A study done in Raleigh North Carolina conducted on Parthenolecanium quercifex  oak scales   showed that this particular species preferred warmer climates and were therefore found in higher abundance in the urban habitats than on oak trees in rural habitats  Over time of living in urban habitats  they have adapted to thrive in warmer climates than in cooler   The presence of non native species is heavily dependent on the amount of human activity  An example of this can be seen in the populations of cliff swallows seen taking nests under the eaves of homes in urban habitats  They make their homes using the shelter provided by the humans in the upper regions of homes  allowing for an influx in their populations due to added protection and reduced predator numbers   5  Other impacts on weather and climate  Aside from the effect on temperature  UHIs can produce secondary effects on local meteorology  including the altering of local wind patterns  the development of clouds and fog  the humidity  and the rates of precipitation  The extra heat provided by the UHI leads to greater upward motion  which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity  In addition  the UHI creates during the day a local low pressure area where relatively moist air from its rural surroundings converges  possibly leading to more favorable conditions for cloud formation  Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%  Partly as a result of this warming  monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between to downwind of cities  compared with upwind  Some cities show a total precipitation increase of 51%   Research has been done in a few areas suggesting that metropolitan areas are less susceptible to weak tornadoes due to the turbulent mixing caused by the warmth of the urban heat island  Using satellite images  researchers discovered that city climates have a noticeable influence on plant growing seasons up to away from a city s edges  Growing seasons in 70 cities in eastern North America were about 15 days longer in urban areas compared to rural areas outside of a city s influence   6  Health effects  UHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents  Within the United States alone  an average of 1 000 people die each year due to extreme heat  As UHIs are characterized by increased temperature  they can potentially increase the magnitude and duration of heat waves within cities  Research has found that the mortality rate during a heat wave increases exponentially with the maximum temperature  an effect that is exacerbated by the UHI  The nighttime effect of UHIs can be particularly harmful during a heat wave  as it deprives urban residents of the cool relief found in rural areas during the night   Research in the United States suggests that the relationship between extreme temperature and mortality varies by location  Heat is more likely to increase the risk of mortality in cities at mid latitudes and high latitudes with significant annual temperature variation  For example  when Chicago and New York experience unusually hot summertime temperatures  elevated levels of illness and death are predicted  In contrast  parts of the country that are mild to hot year round have a lower public health risk from excessive heat  Research shows that residents of southern cities  such as Los Angeles  Phoenix  and Miami  tend to be acclimated to hot weather conditions and therefore less vulnerable to heat related deaths   Increased temperatures have been reported to cause heat stroke  heat exhaustion  heat syncope  and heat cramps  Some studies have also looked at how severe heat stroke can lead to permanent damage to organ systems  This damage can increase the risk of early mortality because the damage can cause severe impairment in organ function  Other complications of heat stroke include respiratory distress syndrome in adults and disseminated intravascular coagulation  Some researchers have noted that any compromise to the human body s ability to thermoregulate would in theory increase risk of mortality  This includes illnesses that may affect a person s mobility  awareness  or behavior  Researchers have noted that individuals with cognitive health issues  e g  depression  dementia  Parkinson s disease  are more at risk when faced with high temperatures and  need to take extra care  as cognitive performance has been shown to be differentially affected by heat  People with diabetes  are overweight  have sleep deprivation  or have cardiovascular cerebrovascular conditions should avoid too much heat exposure  Some common medications that have an effect on thermoregulation can also increase the risk of mortality  Specific examples include anticholinergics  diuretics  phenotiazines and barbiturates  Not only health  but heat can also affect behavior  A U S  study suggests that heat can make people more irritable and aggressive  noting that violent crimes increased by 4 58 out of 100 000 for every one degree increase in temperature   A researcher found that high UHI intensity correlates with increased concentrations of air pollutants that gathered at night  which can affect the next day s air quality  These pollutants include volatile organic compounds  carbon monoxide  nitrogen oxides  and particulate matter  The production of these pollutants combined with the higher temperatures in UHIs can quicken the production of ozone  Ozone at surface level is considered to be a harmful pollutant  Studies suggest that increased temperatures in UHIs can increase polluted days but also note that other factors  e g  air pressure  cloud cover  wind speed  can also have an effect on pollution   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that it  is difficult to make valid projections of heat related illness and death under varying climate change scenarios  and that  heat–related deaths are preventable  as evidenced by the decline of all cause mortality during heat events over the past 35 years   However  some studies suggest the possibility that health impacts from UHIs are disproportionate because the impacts can be unevenly distributed based on a variety of factors  e g  age  ethnicity and socioeconomic status   This raises the possibility of health impacts from UHIs being an environmental justice issue   6 1  Inequality of tree canopy cover  Relationship between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover  In recent years  researchers have discovered a strong correlation between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover  In 2010  researchers at Auburn University and University of Southern California found that the presence of trees are  highly responsive to changes in  neighborhood  income   Low income neighborhoods tend to have significantly less trees than neighborhoods with higher incomes  They described this unequal distribution of trees as a demand for  luxury   rather than  necessity   According to the study   for every 1 percent increase in per capita income  demand for forest cover increased by 1 76 percent  But when income dropped by the same amount  demand decreased by 1 26 percent    Trees are a necessary feature in combating the urban heat island effect because they reduce air temperatures by 10 degrees  and surface temperatures by up to 20 45 degrees  Researchers hypothesized that less well off neighborhoods do not have the financial resources to plant and maintain trees  Wealthy neighborhoods can afford more trees  on  both public and private property    Additionally  many blogging sites overlay satellite imagery provided by google maps and census data to confirm or debunk the aforementioned research   Relationship between race and tree canopy cover  In 2013  researchers from the University of California  Berkeley published a study regarding the racial distribution of  heat risk related land cover   They found that  blacks were 52 percent more likely than whites to live  in a neighborhood with poor tree cover  in such neighborhoods  Asians 32 percent more likely  and Hispanics 21 percent more likely   Bill Jesdale  from the Department of Environmental Science  Policy and Management at University of California  Berkeley  and one of the study s authors  explained that there is  less shared investment  in  racial stratified  communities  which  shows up in the trees  inequality phenomenon    According to Jesdale   segregated places may be less likely to make collective investments  and collective investments are precisely what s needed to support environmental improvements for everyone like planting more trees    Minorities are much more likely to live in communities with greater exposure to traffic  pollution and other environmental hazards  As a result  they are at much higher risk to heat related health problems associated with urban heat islands and climate change  However  research points out that in racially integrated metropolitan areas  whites are  7  Impact on nearby water bodies  UHIs also impair water quality  Hot pavement and rooftop surfaces transfer their excess heat to stormwater  which then drains into storm sewers and raises water temperatures as it is released into streams  rivers  ponds  and lakes  Additionally  increased urban water body temperatures lead to a decrease in diversity in the water  In August 2001  rains over Cedar Rapids  Iowa led to a 10 5C  18 9F  rise in the nearby stream within one hour  which led to a fish kill  Since the temperature of the rain was comparatively cool  it could be attributed to the hot pavement of the city  Similar events have been documented across the American Midwest  as well as Oregon and California  Rapid temperature changes can be stressful to aquatic ecosystems  Permeable pavements may mitigate these effects by percolating water through the pavement into subsurface storage areas where it can be dissipate through absorption and evaporation   8  Impact on energy usage  Another consequence of urban heat islands is the increased energy required for air conditioning and refrigeration in cities that are in comparatively hot climates  The Heat Island Group estimates that the heat island effect costs Los Angeles about US$100 million per year in energy  Conversely  those that are in cold climates such as Moscow  Russia would have less demand for heating  However  through the implementation of heat island reduction strategies  significant annual net energy savings have been calculated for northern locations such as Chicago  Salt Lake City  and Toronto   9  Mitigation  The temperature difference between urban areas and the surrounding suburban or rural areas can be as much as   Nearly 40 percent of that increase is due to the prevalence of dark roofs  with the remainder coming from dark colored pavement and the declining presence of vegetation  The heat island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses  roofs  pavements  and roads  thus increasing the overall albedo of the city  Relative to remedying the other sources of the problem  replacing dark roofing requires the least amount of investment for the most immediate return  A cool roof made from a reflective material such as vinyl reflects at least 75 percent of the sun s rays  and emit at least 70 percent of the solar radiation absorbed by the building envelope  Asphalt built up roofs  BUR   by comparison  reflect 6 percent to 26 percent of solar radiation   Using light colored concrete has proven effective in reflecting up to 50% more light than asphalt and reducing ambient temperature  A low albedo value  characteristic of black asphalt  absorbs a large percentage of solar heat creating warmer near surface temperatures  Paving with light colored concrete  in addition to replacing asphalt with light colored concrete  communities may be able to lower average temperatures  However  research into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings has found that  unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass  solar radiation reflected off light colored pavements can increase building temperatures  increasing air conditioning demands   A second option is to increase the amount of well watered vegetation  These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs  Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment  Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen  The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees  followed by living roofs  light covered surface  and open space planting  From the standpoint of cost effectiveness  light surfaces  light roofs  and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction   A hypothetical  cool communities  program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately after planting ten million trees  reroofing five million homes  and painting one quarter of the roads at an estimated cost of US$1 billion  giving estimated annual benefits of US$170 million from reduced air conditioning costs and US$360 million in smog related health savings   10  Mitigation of urban heat islands  White roofs  Painting rooftops white has become a common strategy to reduce the heat island effect  In cities  there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb the heat of the sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city  White rooftops allows high solar reflectance and high solar emittance  increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring   Green roofs  Green roofs are another method of decreasing the urban heat island effect  Green roofery is the practice of having vegetation on a roof  such as having trees or a garden  The plants that are on the roof increase the albedo and decreases the urban heat island effect  This method has been studied and criticized for the fact that green roofs are affected by climatic conditions of green roof variables are hard to measure  and are very complex systems  Planting trees in cities  Planting trees around the city can be another way of increasing albedo and decreasing the urban heat island effect  Trees absorb carbon dioxide and provide shade  It is recommended to plant deciduous trees because they can provide many benefits such as more shade in the summer and not blocking warmth of winter  11  Mitigation policies  measures and other strategies  11 1  AB32 scoping plan  AB32 required the California Air Resources Board to create a scoping plan  This plan is California s approach on how to carry out their goal of combatting climate change by reducing greenhouse emissions by 2020 to levels from the 1990s  The scoping plan had four primary programs  advanced clean cars  cap and trade  renewables portfolio standard and low carbon fuel standard all geared toward increased energy efficiency  The plan has main strategies to reduce green house gases such as having monetary incentives  regulations and voluntary actions  Every five years the scoping plan is updated   The advanced clean car rules program was made to reduce tail pipe emissions  The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025  Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars  New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog forming emissions  And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6 000 over the life of the car   The renewable portfolio standard mandates to increase renewable energy from a variety of sources such as solar power and wind  Investor owned utilities  community choice aggregators and electric service providers are required to increase procurement to 33% by 2020   Low carbon fuel standards is administered by the California Air Resources Board and attempts to make wider choice of cleaner fuels to Californians  Producers of petroleum based fuels are required to reduce the carbon intensity of their products to 10 percent in 2020   Cap and trade is designed to reduce the effects of climate change by setting a cap on greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere  The cap will decline approximately three percent each year in 2013  The trading will create incentives to reduce the effects of climate change in California communities by reducing greenhouse gases through investments in clean technologies  Clean Air Act  The EPA has initiated several air quality requirements that help reduce ground level ozone that leads to urban heat islands  In the Clean Air Act  one of the EPA s chief policies  there are certain regulations that are put in place to ensure the state s emissions stay below a certain level  Included in the Clean Air Act  all states must set forth an State Implementation Plan  SIP  which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard   State implementation plans and policies  The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy allows a state to add unconventional forms of heat island mitigation  This can include removing pollution after it has already been emitted into air  water  or soil  These measures are not implemented into law  but they do make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient  The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation   The Guidance on State Implementation Plan Credits for Emissions Reductions from Electric Sector Energy Efficiency or Renewable Energy Measures is an educational tool for states to create an up to date and well organized SIP  It allows states to include plans that meet the guidelines or plans that exceed expectations  Based on the success of their SIP  some states can have their plans incorporated into other SIPs   The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes different factions within the state to collaborate on mitigation projects  This policy takes a more of a community based approach by adding several groups for the purpose of multiple perspectives and inventive approaches  The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co benefits for both parties  In example  if a partaking business were to add cool roofs  there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business   12  Implementation of policies  The Seattle Green Factor  a multifaceted system for urban landscaping  has seen much success in the mitigation of urban heat islands  The program focuses on areas that are prone to high pollution  such as business districts  There are strict guidelines for any new construction that exceeds roughly 20 parking spaces  and this platform helps developers physically see their levels of pollution while trying different methods of construction to figure out the most effective course of action  Seattle has correspondingly produced a  score sheet  for cities to use in their city planning   13  AB32 and urban heat islands  Urban heat islands increase demand for energy consumption during the summer when temperatures rise  As a result of increased energy consumption  there is an increase in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions  This policy focuses on lowering greenhouse emissions  which contributes to lowering the heat island effect   14  EPA Compendium of Strategies  This compendium focuses on a variety of issues dealing with urban heat islands  They describe how urban heat islands are created  who is affected  and how people can make a difference to reduce temperature  It also shows examples of policies and voluntary actions by state and local governments to reduce the effect of urban heat islands  15  Incentives  Sacramento Municipal Utility District  SMUD  and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered to provide the city of Sacramento shade trees for free  The program allows citizens to receive trees from four to seven feet tall  They also give them fertilizer  and delivery  all at no cost  They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs  Approximately more than 450 000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area   The Eco Roof Incentive Program  In Canada  grants are distributed throughout Toronto for installing green and cool roofs on residential and commercial buildings  This will reduce usage of energy and lower green house gas emissions   Tree vitalize  This program is a partnership with multiple entities that focuses on helping restore tree cover in the city  it also educates citizens about the positive effects of trees on climate change and the urban heat island effect  And another goal they have is to build capacity among local governments to understand  protect and restore their urban trees  Because there is a need for educating citizens about the maintenance of trees  Treevitalize provides nine hours of classroom and field training to community residents  The classes cover a variety of topics such as tree identification  pruning  tree biology  and proper species selection   16  Weatherization  U S  Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program helps low income recipients by covering their heating bills and helping the families to make their homes energy efficient  In addition  this program allows states to also use the funds to install cooling efficiency measures such as shading devices   17  Outreach and education  Tree Utah  a statewide non profit organization is dedicated to educating communities about the environmental and social benefits provided by trees  They are also committed to planting thousands of trees throughout the state of Utah   The Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley has a high school level course called Global Systems Science  The course focuses on a variety of topics including climate change and the greenhouse effect   18  Tree protection ordinances  A variety of local governments have implemented tree and landscape ordinances  which will help communities by providing shade during summer  Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit  An example is the city of Glendale  California  Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance  the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees  the California sycamore  the coast live oak  mesa oak  valley oak  scrub oak  California bay  Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit  Within the permit they have to provide detailed information about the number of trees affected  trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself  They also have to submit photographs of the site  and a site plan sketch   Another example is the city of Berkeley  California  The tree protection ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited  The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property   The city of Visalia  California has implemented a street tree ordinance intended to promote and regulate the planting  maintenance  and protection of street trees within the city  Their ordinance does not allow street trees to be altered  pruned or removed  Street trees are also protected during construction   19  Co benefits of mitigation strategies  19 1  Trees and gardens aid mental health  A large percentage of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas  which are probably the only connections they have with nature  A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well being  People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier than those who did not   Another study done investigating whether or not the viewing of natural scenery may influence the recoveries of people from undergoing surgeries  found that people who had a window with a scenic view had shorter postoperative hospital stays and fewer negative comments from nurses   19 2  Tree planting as empowerment and community building  Los Angeles TreePeople  is an example of how tree planting can empower a community  Tree people provides the opportunity for people to come together  build capacity  community pride and the opportunity to collaborate and network with each other   19 3  Green roofs as food production  Growing food on rooftops could be an option for fast growing communities  Popular plants grown for food include  chives  oregano and lavender these plants are suitable for green roofs because they are evolutionarily equipped for Mediterranean climate   19 4  Green roofs and wild life biodiversity  Green roofs are important for wildlife because they allow organisms to inhabit the new garden  To maximize opportunities to attract wildlife to a green roof  one must aid the garden to be as diverse as possible in the plants that are added  By planting a wide array of plants  different kinds of invertebrate species will be able to colonize  they will be provided with foraging sources and habitat opportunities   19 5  Urban forests and a cleaner atmosphere  Trees provide benefits such as absorbing carbon dioxide  and other pollutants  Trees also provide shade and reduce ozone emissions from vehicles  By having many trees  we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees  which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the effects of climate change and urban heat islands   19 6  Green building programs  Voluntary green building programs have been promoting the mitigation of the heat island effect for years  For example  one of the ways for a site to earn points under the US Green Building Council s  USGBC  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  LEED  Green Building Rating System is to take action that reduces heat islands  minimizing impacts on microclimates and human and wildlife habitats  Credits associated with reflective roofing or planted roofs can help a building achieve LEED certification  Buildings also receive credits by providing shade  Similarly  The  GBI  s Green Globes program awards points to sites that take measures to decrease a building s energy consumption and reduce the heat island effect  As many as 10 points may be awarded to sites with roof coverage from vegetation  highly reflective materials  or a combination of the two   20  Cost analysis  Every year in the U S  15% of energy goes towards the air conditioning of buildings in these urban heat islands  According to Rosenfeld et al    the air conditioning demand has risen 10% within the last 40 years   Home and business owners alike can benefit from building a cool community  A decrease in energy usage directly correlates to cost efficiency  Areas with substantial vegetation and reflective surface materials used for roofs of houses  pavement  and roads are proven to be more effective and cost efficient   In a case study of the Los Angeles Basin  simulations showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands  they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction  It is estimated that with this wide scale implementation  the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs  lighter colored pavement  and the planting of trees  With a city wide implementation  added benefits from the lowering smog level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year   The cost efficiency of green roofs is quite high because of several reasons  According to Carter   A conventional roof is estimated to be $83 78 m2 while a green roof was estimated at $158 82 m2   For one  green roofs have over double the lifespan of a conventional roof  effectively decelerating the amount of roof replacements every year  In addition to roof life  green roofs add stormwater management reducing fees for utilities  The cost for green roofs is more in the beginning  but over a period of time  their efficiency provides financial as well as health benefits   In Capital E Analysis  conclusions of the financial benefits of green buildings  it was determined that green roofs successfully lowered energy usage and raised health benefits  For every square foot of green roof used in one study the savings amounted to $5 80 energy wise  There were also savings seen in the emissions  water  and maintenance categories  Overall  the savings amounted to $52 90 $71 30 on average while the cost of going green totaled  $3 00 $5 00   21  Global warming  Because some parts of some cities may be hotter than their surroundings  concerns have been raised that the effects of urban sprawl might be misinterpreted as an increase in global temperature  Such effects are removed by homogenization from the raw climate record by comparing urban stations with surrounding stations  While the  heat island  warming is an important local effect  there is no evidence that it biases trends in the homogenized historical temperature record  For example  urban and rural trends are very similar   The Third Assessment Report from the IPCC says   However  over the Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent  both the trends of lower tropospheric temperature and surface air temperature show no significant differences  In fact  the lower tropospheric temperatures warm at a slightly greater rate over North America  about 0 28°C decade using satellite data  than do the surface temperatures  0 27°C decade   although again the difference is not statistically significant  Ground temperature measurements  like most weather observations  are logged by location  Their siting predates the massive sprawl  roadbuilding programs  and high  and medium rise expansions which contribute to the UHI  More importantly  station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets  Doing so  the presence of heat islands is visible  but overall trends change in magnitude  not direction  The effects of the urban heat island may be overstated  One study stated   Contrary to generally accepted wisdom  no statistically significant impact of urbanization could be found in annual temperatures   This was done by using satellite based night light detection of urban areas  and more thorough homogenisation of the time series  with corrections  for example  for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation  and thus cooler  than urban areas   If its conclusion is accepted  then it is necessary to  unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban in situ stations could show no contamination from urban warming   The main conclusion is that microscale and local scale impacts dominate the mesoscale impact of the urban heat island  Many sections of towns may be warmer than rural sites  but surface weather observations are likely to be made in park  cool islands    Not all cities show a warming relative to their rural surroundings  After trends were adjusted in urban weather stations around the world to match rural stations in their regions  in an effort to homogenise the temperature record  in 42 percent of cases  cities were getting cooler relative to their surroundings rather than warmer  One reason is that urban areas are heterogeneous  and weather stations are often sited in  cool islands  – parks  for example – within urban areas   Studies in 2004 and 2006 attempted to test the urban heat island theory  by comparing temperature readings taken on calm nights with those taken on windy nights  If the urban heat island theory is correct then instruments should have recorded a bigger temperature rise for calm nights than for windy ones  because wind blows excess heat away from cities and away from the measuring instruments  There was no difference between the calm and windy nights  and one study said that  we show that  globally  temperatures over land have risen as much on windy nights as on calm nights  indicating that the observed overall warming is not a consequence of urban development    A view often held by those who reject the evidence for global warming is that much of the temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas  For example  Ross McKitrick and Patrick J  Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators  and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend  for 1979–2002  could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the corrected temperature data set they studied—which had already been processed to remove the  modeled  UHI contribution  Critics of this paper  including Gavin A  Schmidt  have said the results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation  McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that  the evidence for contamination of climatic data is robust across numerous data sets    The preliminary results of an independent assessment carried out by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group  and made available to the public in October 2011  found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics  the urban heat island effect did not bias the results obtained by NOAA  the Hadley Centre and NASA s GISS  The Berkeley Earth group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0 911 °C  and their results closely matched those obtained from earlier studies   Climate Change 2007  the Fourth Assessment Report from the IPCC states the following   Studies that have looked at hemispheric and global scales conclude that any urban related trend is an order of magnitude smaller than decadal and longer time scale trends evident in the series  e g   Jones et al   1990  Peterson et al   1999   This result could partly be attributed to the omission from the gridded data set of a small number of sites   1%  with clear urban related warming trends  In a worldwide set of about 270 stations  Parker  2004  2006  noted that warming trends in night minimum temperatures over the period 1950 to 2000 were not enhanced on calm nights  which would be the time most likely to be affected by urban warming  Thus  the global land warming trend discussed is very unlikely to be influenced significantly by increasing urbanisation  Parker  2006       Accordingly  this assessment adds the same level of urban warming uncertainty as in the TAR  0 006°C per decade since 1900 for land  and 0 002°C per decade since 1900 for blended land with ocean  as ocean UHI is zero  A 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America looks at the potential of large scale urban adaptation to counteract the effects of long term global climate change  The researchers calculate that without any adaptive urban design  by 2100 the expansion of existing U S  cities into regional megalopolises could raise near surface temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius over large regions   a significant fraction of the 21st century greenhouse gas induced climate change simulated by global climate models   Large scale adaptive design could completely offset this increase  however  For example  the temperature increase in California was calculated to be as high as 1 31 degrees Celsius  but a 100% deployment of  cool roofs  would result in a temperature drop of 1 47 degrees Celsius — more than the increase   22  See
