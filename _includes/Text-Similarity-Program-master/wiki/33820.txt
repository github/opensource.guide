Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky      Vasiliy Vasil’yevich Kandinskiy     – 13 December 1944  was an influential Russian painter and art theorist  He is credited with painting one of the first purely abstract works  Born in Moscow  Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa  He enrolled at the University of Moscow  studying law and economics  Successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship  chair of Roman Law  at the University of Dorpat—Kandinsky began painting studies  life drawing  sketching and anatomy  at the age of 30   In 1896 Kandinsky settled in Munich  studying first at Anton Ažbe s private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts  He returned to Moscow in 1914  after the outbreak of World War I  Kandinsky was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Communist Moscow  and returned to Germany in 1921  There  he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933  He then moved to France  where he lived for the rest of his life  becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art  He died at Neuilly sur Seine in 1944   1  Artistic periods  Kandinsky s creation of abstract work followed a long period of development and maturation of intense thought based on his artistic experiences  He called this devotion to inner beauty  fervor of spirit  and spiritual desire inner necessity  it was a central aspect of his art   1 1  Youth and inspiration  1866–1896   Kandinsky was born in Moscow  the son of Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky  a tea merchant  Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow  He studied many fields while in school  including law and economics  Later in life  he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child  His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew  In 1889  he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the Vologda region north of Moscow  In Looks on the Past  he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them  he felt that he was moving into a painting  This experience  and his study of the region s folk art  particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background   was reflected in much of his early work  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted  writing   Colour is the keyboard  the eyes are the hammers  the soul is the piano with many strings  The artist is the hand which plays  touching one key or another  to cause vibrations in the soul    In 1896  at the age of 30  Kandinsky gave up a promising career teaching law and economics to enroll in art school in Munich  He was not immediately granted admission  and began learning art on his own  That same year  before leaving Moscow  he saw an exhibit of paintings by Monet  He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of Haystacks  this  to him  had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves  Later  he would write about this experience   Kandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by Richard Wagner s Lohengrin which  he felt  pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism  He was also spiritually influenced by H  P  Blavatsky  1831–1891   the best known exponent of theosophy  Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression  beginning with a single point  The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles  triangles and squares  Kandinsky s book Concerning the Spiritual In Art  1910  and Point and Line to Plane  1926  echoed this theosophical tenet  Illustrations by John Varley in Thought Forms  1901  influenced him visually   1 2  Metamorphosis  Art school  usually considered difficult  was easy for Kandinsky  It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter  The number of his existing paintings increased at the beginning of the 20th century  much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted  using broad swaths of colour and recognizable forms  For the most part  however  Kandinsky s paintings did not feature any human figures  an exception is Sunday  Old Russia  1904   in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful  and fanciful  view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town  Riding Couple  1907  depicts a man on horseback  holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a river  The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees  the town  and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness  This work demonstrates the influence of pointillism in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat  luminescent surface  Fauvism is also apparent in these early works  Colours are used to express Kandinsky s experience of subject matter  not to describe objective nature   Perhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was The Blue Rider  1903   which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow  The rider s cloak is medium blue  which casts a darker blue shadow  In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows  the counterparts of the fall trees in the background  The blue rider in the painting is prominent  but not clearly defined   and the horse has an unnatural gait  which Kandinsky must have known   Some art historians believe that a second figure  perhaps a child  is being held by the rider  although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider  This intentional disjunction  allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork  became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years  it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911–1914 period  In The Blue Rider  Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail  This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters  but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later   From 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe  he was an associate of the Blue Rose symbolist group of Moscow   until he settled in the small Bavarian town of Murnau  The Blue Mountain  1908–1909  was painted at this time  demonstrating his trend toward abstraction  A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees  one yellow and one red  A procession  with three riders and several others  crosses at the bottom  The faces  clothing  and saddles of the riders are each a single colour  and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail  The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence  The broad use of colour in The Blue Mountain illustrates Kandinsky s inclination toward an art in which colour is presented independently of form  and which each colour is given equal attention  The composition is more planar  the painting is divided into four sections  the sky  the red tree  the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders   Vassily Kandinsky  1898   Odessa Port jpg Odessa Port  1898 Vassily Kandinsky  1901   Akhtyrka jpg Akhtyrka  1901 Vassily Kandinsky  1906   Rotterdam sun

masses evaluated independently from forms and lines  these serve no longer to delimit them  but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force  Music was important to the birth of abstract art  since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world  but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul  Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works  he called his most spontaneous paintings  improvisations  and described more elaborate works as  compositions    In addition to painting  Kandinsky was an art theorist  his influence on the history of Western art stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings  He helped found the Neue Künstlervereinigung München  Munich New Artists  Association   becoming its president in 1909  However  the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky  and others  with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911  Kandinsky then formed a new group  the Blue Rider  Der Blaue Reiter  with like minded artists such as August Macke and Franz Marc  The group released an almanac  The Blue Rider Almanac  and held two exhibits  More of each were planned  but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via Switzerland and Sweden   His writing in The Blue Rider Almanac and the treatise  On the Spiritual In Art   which was released in 1910  were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality  He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous  apart from the visual description of an object or other form   These ideas had an almost immediate international impact  particularly in the English speaking world  As early as 1912  On the Spiritual In Art was reviewed by Michael Sadleir in the London based Art News  Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of On the Spiritual In Art in 1914  Extracts from the book were published that year in Percy Wyndham Lewis s periodical Blast  and Alfred Orage s weekly cultural newspaper The New Age  Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain  however  in 1910  he participated in the Allied Artists  Exhibition  organised by Frank Rutter  at London s Royal Albert Hall  This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist Spencer Frederick Gore in The Art News   Sadleir s interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky s first works entering a British art collection  Sadleir s father  Michael Sadler  acquired several woodprints and the abstract painting Fragment for Composition VII in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year  These works were displayed in Leeds  either in the University or the premises of the Leeds Arts Club  between 1913 and 1923   Vassily

Return to Russia  1914–1921   From 1918 to 1921  Kandinsky dealt with the cultural politics of Russia and collaborated in art education and museum reform  He painted little during this period  but devoted his time to artistic teaching  with a program based on form and colour analysis  he also helped organize the Institute of Artistic Culture in Moscow  In 1916 he met Nina Andreievskaya  whom he married the following year  His spiritual  expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois  In 1921  Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the Bauhaus of Weimar by its founder  architect Walter Gropius   1 5  Bauhaus  1922–1933   Kandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the Bauhaus  he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology  The development of his works on forms study  particularly on points and line forms  led to the publication of his second theoretical book  Point and Line to Plane  in 1926  Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting—particularly the circle  half circle  the angle  straight lines and curves  This period was intensely productive  This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations—as in Yellow – red – blue  1925   where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the constructivism and suprematism movements influential at the time   The two meter wide Yellow – red – blue  1925  consists of several main forms  a vertical yellow rectangle  an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle  a multitude of straight  or sinuous  black lines  circular arcs  monochromatic circles and scattered  coloured checkerboards contribute to its delicate complexity  This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work  whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation—not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship  their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony   Kandinsky was one of Die Blaue Vier  Blue Four   formed in 1923 with Klee  Feininger and von Jawlensky  which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924  Due to right wing hostility  the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in Dessau in 1925  Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for Berlin  until its dissolution in July 1933  Kandinsky then left Germany  settling in Paris   Vassily Kandinsky  1922   Kleine Welten I jpg Small worlds I  1922 Vassily Kandinsky  1923   Circles in a Circle

studio  Biomorphic forms with supple  non geometric outlines appear in his paintings—forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist s inner life  Kandinsky used original colour compositions  evoking Slavic popular art  He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular  rustic texture to his paintings   This period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky s previous work in which he used all elements  enriching them  In 1936 and 1939 he painted his two last major compositions  the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years  Composition IX has highly contrasted  powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb  Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of Composition X as star fragments  or filaments   while enigmatic hieroglyphs with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper left corner of the canvas  In Kandinsky’s work some characteristics are obvious  while certain touches are more discrete and veiled  they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work  He intended his forms  which he subtly harmonized and placed  to resonate with the observer s soul   Vassily Kandinsky  1935   Brown with supplement jpg Brown with supplement  1935 Vassily Kandinsky  1936

ultimate teacher   Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten Compositions  The first three survive only in black and white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend Gabriele Münter  While studies  sketches  and improvisations exist  particularly of Composition II   a Nazi raid on the Bauhaus in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky s first three Compositions  They were displayed in the State sponsored exhibit  Degenerate Art   and then destroyed  along with works by Paul Klee  Franz Marc and other modern artists    Influenced by theosophy and the perception of a coming New Age  a common theme among Kandinsky s first seven Compositions is the apocalypse  the end of the world as we know it   Writing of the  artist as prophet  in his book  Concerning the Spiritual In Art  Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality  Raised an Orthodox Christian  Kandinsky drew upon the Jewish and Christian stories of Noah s Ark  Jonah and the whale  Christ s resurrection  the four horsemen of the Apocalypse in the book of Revelation  Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth  Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative  he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death–rebirth and destruction–creation he felt were imminent in the pre World War I world   As he stated in Concerning the Spiritual In Art  see below   Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from  an internal necessity  inhabits the tip of an upward moving pyramid  This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future  What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today  what is avant garde today  and understood only by the few  is common knowledge tomorrow  The modern artist–prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid  making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow s reality  Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world   Composition IV and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist  As in his painting of the apocalypse by water  Composition VI   Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms  with a sense of desperation  flurry  urgency  and confusion   This spiritual communion of viewer painting artist prophet may be described within the limits of words and images   2 2  Artistic and spiritual theorist  As the Der Blaue Reiter Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Schoenberg indicate  Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind  synesthesia   Hearing tones and chords as he painted  Kandinsky theorized that  for example   yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet  black is the colour of closure  and the end of things  and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies  akin to chords played on a piano  Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships—claiming  for example  that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul  These theories are explained in Point and Line to Plane  see below    During the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for Composition IV  he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk  While he was out  Gabriele Münter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side  Upon returning and seeing the canvas  but not yet recognizing it  Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept  saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen  He had been liberated from attachment to an object  As when he first viewed Monet s Haystacks  the experience would change his life   In another episode with Münter during the Bavarian abstract expressionist years  Kandinsky was working on his Composition VI  From nearly six months of study and preparation  he had intended the work to evoke a flood  baptism  destruction  and rebirth simultaneously  After outlining the work on a mural sized wood panel  he became blocked and could not go on  Münter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture  She suggested he simply repeat the word uberflut   deluge  or  flood   and focus on its sound rather than its meaning  Repeating this word like a mantra  Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three day span   3  Theoretical writings on art  Kandinsky s analyses on forms and colours result not from simple  arbitrary idea associations but from the painter s inner experience  He spent years creating abstract  sensorially rich paintings  working with form and colour  tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists  noting their effects on his sense of colour  This subjective experience is something that anyone can do—not scientific  objective observations but inner  subjective ones  what French philosopher Michel Henry calls  absolute subjectivity  or the  absolute phenomenological life    3 1  Concerning the spiritual in art  Published in 1912  Kandinsky s text  Du Spirituel dans l’art  defines three types of painting  impressions  improvisations and compositions  While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point  improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious  though composition is developed from a more formal point of view  Kandinsky compares the spiritual life of humanity to a pyramid—the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work  The point of the pyramid is those few  great artists  It is a spiritual pyramid  advancing and ascending slowly even if it sometimes appears immobile  During decadent periods  the soul sinks to the bottom of the pyramid  humanity searches only for external success  ignoring spiritual forces   Colours on the painter s palette evoke a double effect  a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours  similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy  This effect can be much deeper  however  causing a vibration of the soul or an  inner resonance —a spiritual effect in which the colour touches the soul itself    Inner necessity  is  for Kandinsky  the principle of art and the foundation of forms and the harmony of colours  He defines it as the principle of efficient contact of the form with the human soul  Every form is the delimitation of a surface by another one  it possesses an inner content  the effect it produces on one who looks at it attentively  This inner necessity is the right of the artist to unlimited freedom  but this freedom becomes licence if it is not founded on such a necessity  Art is born from the inner necessity of the artist in an enigmatic  mystical way through which it acquires an autonomous life  it becomes an independent subject  animated by a spiritual breath   The obvious properties we can see when we look at an isolated colour and let it act alone  on one side is the warmth or coldness of the colour tone  and on the other side is the clarity or obscurity of that tone  Warmth is a tendency towards yellow  and coldness a tendency towards blue  yellow and blue form the first great  dynamic contrast  Yellow has an eccentric movement and blue a concentric movement  a yellow surface seems to move closer to us  while a blue surface seems to move away  Yellow is a typically terrestrial colour  whose violence can be painful and aggressive  Blue is a celestial colour  evoking a deep calm  The combination of blue and yellow yields total immobility and calm  which is green   Clarity is a tendency towards white  and obscurity is a tendency towards black  White and black form the second great contrast  which is static  White is a deep  absolute silence  full of possibility  Black is nothingness without possibility  an eternal silence without hope  and corresponds with death  Any other colour resonates strongly on its neighbors  The mixing of white with black leads to gray  which possesses no active force and whose tonality is near that of green  Gray corresponds to immobility without hope  it tends to despair when it becomes dark  regaining little hope when it lightens   Red is a warm colour  lively and agitated  it is forceful  a movement in itself  Mixed with black it becomes brown  a hard colour  Mixed with yellow  it gains in warmth and becomes orange  which imparts an irradiating movement on its surroundings  When red is mixed with blue it moves away from man to become purple  which is a cool red  Red and green form the third great contrast  and orange and purple the fourth   3 2  Point and line to plane  In his writings  Kandinsky analyzed the geometrical elements which make up every painting—the point and the line  He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the basic plane  or BP  He did not analyze them objectively  but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer   A point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas  It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction  it is extension  form and colour  This form can be a square  a triangle  a circle  a star or something more complex  The point is the most concise form but  according to its placement on the basic plane  it will take a different tonality  It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines   A line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction  the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist  The produced linear forms may be of several types  a straight line  which results from a unique force applied in a single direction  an angular line  resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions  or a curved  or wave like  line  produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously  A plane may be obtained by condensation  from a line rotated around one of its ends    The subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation  a horizontal line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves  it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue  A vertical line corresponds with height  and offers no support  it possesses a luminous  warm tonality close to white and yellow  A diagonal possesses a more or less warm  or cold  tonality  according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical   A force which deploys itself  without obstacle  as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with lyricism  several forces which confront  or annoy  each other form a drama  The angle formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle  a triangle   cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle  a circle   and similar to red for a right angle  a square    The basic plane is  in general  rectangular or square  therefore  it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting  communicating its affective tonality  This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines  the horizontals giving a calm  cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm  warm tonality  The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions  which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work  Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being  which the artist  fertilizes  and feels  breathing    Each part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration  this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it  and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas  The above of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness  while the below evokes condensation and heaviness  The painter s job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process  but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty   This book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky’s works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations  and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care  that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul   4  Art market  In 2012  Christie s auctioned Kandinsky s Studie für Improvisation 8  Study for Improvisation 8   a 1909 view of a man wielding a broadsword in a rainbow hued village  for $23 million  The painting had been on loan to the Kunstmuseum Winterthur  Switzerland  since 1960 and was sold to a European collector by the Volkart Foundation  the charitable arm of the Swiss commodities trading firm Volkart Brothers  Before this sale  the artist s last record was set in 1990 when Sotheby s sold his Fugue  1914  for $20 9 million   5  In popular culture  The 1990 play Six Degrees of Separation refers to a  double sided Kandinsky  painting  No such painting is known to exist  in the 1993 film version of the play  the double sided painting is portrayed as having Kandinsky s 1913 painting Black Lines on one side and his 1926 painting Several Circles on the other side  In 2014  Google commemorated Kandinsky s 148th birthday by featuring a Google Doodle based on his abstract paintings   6  See also  Goethe s Theory
