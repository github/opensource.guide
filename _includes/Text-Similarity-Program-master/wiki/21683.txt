began her career as a singer and actress in the early 1960s  but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan  In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number one hit with  These Boots Are Made for Walkin    which showed her provocative but good natured style  and which popularized and made her synonymous with go go boots  The promo clip featured a big haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops  go go boots and mini skirts  The song was written by Lee Hazlewood  who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets  including the critical and cult favorite  Some Velvet Morning   In 1966 and 1967  Sinatra charted with 13 titles  all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor   Sinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid 60s including

2  Recording career  2 1  1960s  In the late 1950s  Sinatra began to study music  dancing  and voice at the University of California  Los Angeles  She dropped out after a year  and made her professional debut in 1960 on her father s television special  The Frank Sinatra Timex Show  Welcome Home Elvis  celebrating the return of Elvis Presley from Europe following his discharge from service in the US Army  Nancy was sent to the airport on behalf of her father to welcome Elvis when his plane landed  On the special  Nancy and her father danced and sang a duet   You Make Me Feel So Young Old   That same year she began a five year marriage to Tommy Sands   Sinatra was signed to her father s label  Reprise Records  in 1961  Her first single   Cuff Links and a Tie Clip   went unnoticed  However  subsequent singles charted in Europe and Japan  Without a hit in the US by 1965  she was on the verge of being dropped  Her singing career received a boost with the help of songwriter producer arranger Lee Hazlewood  who had been making records for ten years  notably with Duane Eddy  Hazlewood became Sinatra s inspiration  He had her sing in a lower key and crafted pop songs for her  Bolstered by an image overhaul — including bleached blonde hair  frosted lips  heavy eye make up and Carnaby Street fashions — Sinatra made her mark on the American  and British  music scene in early 1966 with  These Boots Are Made for Walkin    its title inspired by a line in Robert Aldrich s 1963 western comedy 4 for Texas starring her father and Dean Martin  One of her many hits written by Hazlewood  it received three Grammy Award nominations  including two for Sinatra and one for arranger Billy Strange  It sold over one million copies  and was awarded a gold disc  The camp

Kim  Little Birdy  Billy Ray Cyrus  Faster Pussycat  KMFDM  Symarip  Operation Ivy and the Del Rubio Triplets and The Supremes   A run of chart singles followed  including the two 1966 Top 10 hits  How Does That Grab You  Darlin     #7  and  Sugar Town   #5    Sugar Town  became her second million seller  The ballad  Somethin  Stupid  — a duet with her father — hit #1 in the US and the UK in April 1967 and spent nine weeks at the top of Billboard s easy listening chart  It earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year and remains the only father daughter duet to hit No 1 in the US  it became Sinatra s third million selling disc  Other 45s showing her forthright delivery include  Friday’s Child   #36  1966   and the 1967 hits  Love Eyes   #15  and  Lightning’s Girl   #24   She rounded out 1967 with the raunchy but low charting  Tony Rome   #83  — the title track from the detective film Tony Rome starring her father — while her first solo single in 1968 was the more wistful  100 Years   #69   In 1968 she recorded the Kenny Young song  The Highway Song  with Mickey Most producing for the UK and European markets  The song reached top 20 in the UK and other European countries   Sinatra enjoyed a parallel recording career cutting duets with the husky voiced  country and western inspired Hazlewood  starting with  Summer Wine   originally the B side of  Sugar Town    Their biggest hit was a cover of the country song   Jackson   The single peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1967  when Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash also made the song their own  In December they released the  MOR  psychedelic single  Some Velvet Morning   regarded as one of the more unusual singles in pop  and the peak of Sinatra and Hazlewood’s vocal collaborations  It reached #26 in the US  The promo clip is  like the song  sui generis  The British broadsheet The Daily Telegraph placed  Some Velvet Morning  in pole position in its 2003 list of the Top 50 Best Duets Ever    Somethin  Stupid  ranked number 27    In 1967  she recorded the theme song for the James Bond film You Only Live Twice  In the liner notes of the CD reissue of her 1966 album  Nancy In London  Sinatra states that she was  scared to death  of recording the song  and asked the songwriters   Are you sure you don t want Shirley Bassey   There are two versions of the Bond theme  The first is the lushly orchestrated track featured during the opening and closing credits of the film  The second – and more guitar heavy — version appeared on the double A sided single with  Jackson   though the Bond theme stalled at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100   In 1966 and 1967 Sinatra traveled to Vietnam to perform for the US troops  Many US soldiers adopted her song  These Boots Are Made for Walkin   as their anthem  as shown in Pierre Schoendoerffer s academy award winning documentary The Anderson Platoon  1967  and reprised in a scene in Stanley Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket  1987   Sinatra recorded several anti war songs  including  My Buddy   featured on her album Sugar   Home   co written by Mac Davis  and  It s Such A Lonely Time of Year   which appeared on the 1968 LP The Sinatra Family Wish

went to Linda Evans in Beach Blanket Bingo  Nancy did not do the film as her character was kidnapped and the parallel to her brother Frank Sinatra  Jr  s kidnapping was not considered tasteful   In 1966 she appeared as herself in The Oscar  and starred in The Last of the Secret Agents  as well as singing the title song  and also starred in Roger Corman s The Wild Angels with Peter Fonda and Bruce Dern  and in 1968 she shared the screen with Elvis Presley in Speedway — her final film  She was the only singer to have a solo song on an Elvis album or soundtrack  Ann Margret had performed a

father and his Rat Pack pals Dean Martin and Sammy Davis  Jr   with a cameo appearance by her brother Frank Sinatra  Jr  and guest star appearance by West Side Story dancer David Winters  At one point in the video  Sinatra shared a kiss with Sammy Davis  Jr  She has stated  The kiss  was  one of the first interracial kisses seen on television and it caused some controversy then  and now   But  contrary to some inaccurate online reports  the kiss was unplanned and spontaneous   The special also features Winters  choreography  dancing and dancers  As there was no Emmy Award category for Choreography – the shows Emmy Nomination was placed in the  Special Classification of Individual Achievements  category  Possibly due to this specials success and its choreography a new category for  Outstanding Choreography  was created by the Emmys the next year  Movin  With Nancy was sponsored by Royal Crown Cola   2 2  1970s and 1980s  Sinatra remained with Reprise until 1970  In 1971  she

 Annabell of Mobile    It s for My Dad   and  Indian Summer   with Hazlewood    Kinky Love  was banned by some radio stations in the 1970s for  suggestive  lyrics  It saw the light of day on CD in

1966  She and Billy Strange worked on the arrangement  and it was Sinatra s idea to change from a mid tempo romp  as sung in Cher s hit single  to a ballad  Sinatra s father asked her to sing it on
