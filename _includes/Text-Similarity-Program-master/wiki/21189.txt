The Neolithic Era  or Period  from νέος  néos   new   and λίθος  líthos   stone    or New Stone Age  was a period in the development of human technology  beginning about 10 200 BC  according to the ASPRO chronology  in some parts of the Middle East  and later in other parts of the world and ending between 4 500 and 2 000 BC   Traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age  the Neolithic followed the terminal Holocene Epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming  which produced the  Neolithic Revolution   It ended when metal tools became widespread  in the Copper Age or Bronze Age  or  in some geographical regions  in the Iron Age   The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes  including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals   The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant  Jericho  modern day West Bank  about 10 200–8 800 BC  It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region  whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals  which then evolved into true farming  The Natufian period was between 12 000 and 10 200 BC  and the so called  proto neolithic  is now included in the Pre Pottery Neolithic  PPNA  between 10 200 and 8 800 BC  As the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet  and a sedentary way of life had begun among them  the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are thought to have forced people to develop farming  By 10 200–8 800 BC  farming communities arose in the Levant and spread to Asia Minor  North Africa and North Mesopotamia  Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants  both wild and domesticated  which included einkorn wheat  millet and spelt  and the keeping of dogs  sheep and goats  By about 6 900–6 400 BC  it included domesticated cattle and pigs  the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements  and the use of pottery   Not all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order  the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery  In other parts of the world  such as Africa  South Asia and Southeast Asia  independent domestication events led to their own regionally distinctive Neolithic cultures that arose completely independent of those in Europe and Southwest Asia  Early Japanese societies and other East Asian cultures used pottery before developing agriculture   Unlike the Paleolithic  when more than one human species existed  only one human species  Homo sapiens sapiens  reached the Neolithic  Homo floresiensis may have survived right up to the very dawn of the Neolithic  about 12 200 years ago   The term Neolithic derives from the Greek νεολιθικός  neolithikos  from νέος neos   new  + λίθος lithos   stone   literally meaning  New Stone Age   The term was invented by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three age system   1  Periods by pottery phase  In the Middle East  cultures identified as Neolithic began appearing by in the 10th millennium BC  Early development occurred in the Levant  e g  Pre Pottery Neolithic A and Pre Pottery Neolithic B  and from there spread eastwards and westwards  Neolithic cultures are also attested in southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia by c  8 000 BC   The prehistoric Beifudi site near Yixian in Hebei Province  China  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan and Xinglongwa cultures of about 5 000–6 000 BC  neolithic cultures east of the Taihang Mountains  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures  The total excavated area is more than 1 200 square yards and the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases   1 1  Neolithic 1 – Pre Pottery Neolithic A  PPNA   The Neolithic 1  PPNA  period began roughly 10 000 years ago in the Levant  A temple area in southeastern Turkey at Göbekli Tepe dated around 9 500 BC may be regarded as the beginning of the period  This site was developed by nomadic hunter gatherer tribes  evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human made place of worship  At least seven stone circles  covering   contain limestone pillars carved with animals  insects and birds  Stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars  which may have supported roofs  Other early PPNA sites dating to around 9 500 to 9 000 BC have been found in Jericho  Israel  notably Ain Mallaha  Nahal Oren  and Kfar HaHoresh   Gilgal in the Jordan Valley  and Byblos  Lebanon  The start of Neolithic 1 overlaps the Tahunian and Heavy Neolithic periods to some degree   The major advance of Neolithic 1 was true farming  In the proto Neolithic Natufian cultures  wild cereals were harvested  and perhaps early seed selection and re seeding occurred  The grain was ground into flour  Emmer wheat was domesticated  and animals were herded and domesticated  animal husbandry and selective breeding    In the 21st century  remains of figs were discovered in a house in Jericho dated to 9 400 BC  The figs are of a mutant variety that cannot be pollinated by insects  and therefore the trees can only reproduce from cuttings  This evidence suggests that figs were the first cultivated crop and mark the invention of the technology of farming  This occurred centuries before the first cultivation of grains   Settlements became more permanent with circular houses  much like those of the Natufians  with single rooms  However  these houses were for the first time made of mudbrick  The settlement had a surrounding stone wall and perhaps a stone tower  as in Jericho   The wall served as protection from nearby groups  as protection from floods  or to keep animals penned  There are also some enclosures that suggest grain and meat storage   1 2  Neolithic 2 – Pre Pottery Neolithic B  PPNB   The Neolithic 2  PPNB  began around 8 800 BC according to the ASPRO chronology in the Levant  Jericho  Israel   As with the PPNA dates there are two versions from the same laboratories noted above  But this terminological structure is not convenient for southeast Anatolia and settlements of the middle Anatolia basin  This era was before the Mesolithic era   Settlements have rectangular mud brick houses where the family lived together in single or multiple rooms  Burial findings suggest an ancestor cult where people preserved skulls of the dead  which were plastered with mud to make facial features  The rest of the corpse may have been left outside the settlement to decay until only the bones were left  then the bones were buried inside the settlement underneath the floor or between houses   1 3  Neolithic 3 – Pottery Neolithic  PN   The Neolithic 3  PN  began around 6 400 BC in the Fertile Crescent  By then distinctive cultures emerged  with pottery like the Halafian  Turkey  Syria  Northern Mesopotamia  and Ubaid  Southern Mesopotamia   This period has been further divided into PNA  Pottery Neolithic A  and PNB  Pottery Neolithic B  at some sites   The Chalcolithic period began about 4500 BC  then the Bronze Age began about 3500 BC  replacing the Neolithic cultures   2  Periods by region  2 1  Fertile Crescent  Around 10 200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phase Pre Pottery Neolithic A  PPNA  appeared in the fertile crescent  Around 10 700 to 9 400 BC a settlement was established in Tell Qaramel  10 miles north of Aleppo  The settlement included 2 temples dating back to 9 650  Around 9000 BC during the PPNA  one of the world s first towns  Jericho  appeared in the Levant  It was surrounded by a stone and marble wall and contained a population of 2000–3000 people and a massive stone tower  Around 6 400 BC the Halaf culture appeared in Lebanon  Israel and Palestine  Syria  Anatolia  and Northern Mesopotamia and subsisted on dryland agriculture   In 1981 a team of researchers from the Maison de l Orient et de la Méditerranée  including Jacques Cauvin and Oliver Aurenche divided Near East neolithic chronology into ten periods  0 to 9  based on social  economic and cultural characteristics  In 2002 Danielle Stordeur and Frédéric Abbès advanced this system with a division into five periods  Natufian  1  between 12 000 and 10 200 BC  Khiamian  2  between 10 200 8 800 BC  PPNA  Sultanian  Jericho   Mureybetian  early PPNB  PPNB ancien   3  between 8 800 7 600 BC  middle PPNB  PPNB moyen  7 600 6 900 BC  late PPNB  PPNB récent   4  between 7 500 and 7 000 BC and a PPNB  sometimes called PPNC  transitional stage  PPNB final   5  where Halaf and dark faced burnished ware begin to emerge between 6 900 6 400 BC  They also advanced the idea of a transitional stage between the PPNA and PPNB between 8 800 and 8 600 BC at sites like Jerf el Ahmar and Tell Aswad   2 2  Southern Mesopotamia  Alluvial plains  Sumer Elam   Little rainfall makes irrigation systems necessary  Ubaid culture from 6 900 BC   2 3  North Africa  Domestication of sheep and goats reached Egypt from the Near East possibly as early as 6 000 BC  Graeme Barker states  The first indisputable evidence for domestic plants and animals in the Nile valley is not until the early fifth millennium bc in northern Egypt and a thousand years later further south  in both cases as part of strategies that still relied heavily on fishing  hunting  and the gathering of wild plants  and suggests that these subsistence changes were not due to farmers migrating from the Near East but was an indigenous development  with cereals either indigenous or obtained through exchange  Other scholars argue that the primary stimulus for agriculture and domesticated animals  as well as mud brick architecture and other Neolithic cultural features  in Egypt was from the Middle East   2 4  Europe  In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC  attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe  discovered in Vashtëmi  southeastern Albania and dating back to 6 500 BC  Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC  and in Central Europe by c  5800 BC  La Hoguette   Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly  which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo Körös  Cris   Linearbandkeramik  and Vinča  Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples  the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC  The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing  the Vinča signs  though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing  The Cucuteni Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania  Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC  The megalithic temple complexes of Ġgantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo  in the Maltese archipelago  and of Mnajdra  Malta  are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures  the oldest of which date back to c  3600 BC  The Hypogeum of Ħal Saflieni  Paola  Malta  is a subterranean structure excavated c  2500 BC  originally a sanctuary  it became a necropolis  the only prehistoric underground temple in the world  and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands  After 2500 BC  the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants  a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta  In most cases there are small chambers here  with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones  They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples  It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea   2 5  South and East Asia  The earliest Neolithic site in South Asia is Mehrgarh  dated to 7500 BC  in the Kachi plain of Baluchistan  Pakistan  the site has evidence of farming  wheat and barley  and herding  cattle  sheep and goats    In South India  the Neolithic began by 3000 BC and lasted until around 1400 BC when the Megalithic transition period began  South Indian Neolithic is characterized by Ashmounds since 2500 BC in Karnataka region  expanded later to Tamil Nadu   In East Asia  the earliest sites include Nanzhuangtou culture around 9500 BC to 9000 BC  Pengtoushan culture around 7500 BC to 6100 BC  Peiligang culture around 7000 BC to 5000 BC   The  Neolithic   defined in this paragraph as using polished stone implements  remains a living tradition in small and extremely remote and inaccessible pockets of West Papua  Indonesian New Guinea   Polished stone adze and axes are used in the present day    in areas where the availability of metal implements is limited  This is likely to cease altogether in the next few years as the older generation die off and steel blades and chainsaws prevail   In 2012  news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam ri  Goseong  Gangwon Province  South Korea  which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia   No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before  the institute said  adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula   The farm was dated between 3600 and 3000 B C  Pottery  stone projectile points  and possible houses were also found   In 2002  researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware  jade earrings  among other items in the area   The research team will perform Accelerator mass spectrometry  AMS  dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site   2 6  America  In Mesoamerica  a similar set of events  i e   crop domestication and sedentary lifestyles  occurred by around 4500 BC  but possibly as early as 11 000–10 000 BC  These cultures are usually not referred to as belonging to the Neolithic  in America different terms are used such as Formative stage instead of mid late Neolithic  Archaic Era instead of Early Neolithic and Paleo Indian for the preceding period  The Formative stage is equivalent to the Neolithic Revolution period in Europe  Asia  and Africa  In the Southwestern United States it occurred from 500 to 1200 C E  when there was a dramatic increase in population and development of large villages supported by agriculture based on dryland farming of maize  and later  beans  squash  and domesticated turkeys  During this period the bow and arrow and ceramic pottery were also introduced   3  Social organization  During most of the Neolithic age  people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages  There is little scientific evidence of developed social stratification in most Neolithic societies  social stratification is more associated with the later Bronze Age  Although some late Neolithic societies formed complex stratified chiefdoms similar to Polynesian societies such as the Ancient Hawaiians  most Neolithic societies were relatively simple and egalitarian  However  Neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the Paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter gatherer cultures in general   The domestication of animals  c  8000 BC  resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality  Possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited inequalities of wealth  Neolithic pastoralists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock  and this made economic inequalities more pronounced  However  evidence of social inequality is still disputed  as settlements such as Catal Huyuk reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites  suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital  although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others   Families and households were still largely independent economically  and the household was probably the center of life  However  excavations in Central Europe have revealed that early Neolithic Linear Ceramic cultures   Linearbandkeramik   were building large arrangements of circular ditches between 4800 BC and 4600 BC  These structures  and their later counterparts such as causewayed enclosures  burial mounds  and henge  required considerable time and labour to construct  which suggests that some influential individuals were able to organise and direct human labour — though non hierarchical and voluntary work remain possibilities   There is a large body of evidence for fortified settlements at Linearbandkeramik sites along the Rhine  as at least some villages were fortified for some time with a palisade and an outer ditch  Settlements with palisades and weapon traumatized bones have been discovered  such as at the Talheim Death Pit demonstrates     systematic violence between groups  and warfare was probably much more common during the Neolithic than in the preceding Paleolithic period  This supplanted an earlier view of the Linear Pottery Culture as living a  peaceful  unfortified lifestyle    Control of labour and inter group conflict is characteristic of corporate level or  tribal  groups  headed by a charismatic individual  whether a  big man  or a proto chief  functioning as a lineage group head  Whether a non hierarchical system of organization existed is debatable  and there is no evidence that explicitly suggests that Neolithic societies functioned under any dominating class or individual  as was the case in the chiefdoms of the European Early Bronze Age  Theories to explain the apparent implied egalitarianism of Neolithic  and Paleolithic  societies have arisen  notably the Marxist concept of primitive communism   4  Shelter  The shelter of the early people changed dramatically from the paleolithic to the neolithic era  In the paleolithic  people did not normally live in permanent constructions  In the neolithic  mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster  The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible  Doorways were made on the roof  with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses  The roof was supported by beams from the inside  The rough ground was covered by platforms  mats  and skins on which residents slept  Stilt houses settlements were common in the Alpine and Pianura Padana  Terramare  region  Remains have been found at the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia and at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria  for example   5  Farming  A significant and far reaching shift in human subsistence and lifestyle was to be brought about in areas where crop farming and cultivation were first developed  the previous reliance on an essentially nomadic hunter gatherer subsistence technique or pastoral transhumance was at first supplemented  and then increasingly replaced by  a reliance upon the foods produced from cultivated lands  These developments are also believed to have greatly encouraged the growth of settlements  since it may be supposed that the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings  This trend would continue into the Bronze Age  eventually giving rise to permanently settled farming towns  and later cities and states whose larger populations could be sustained by the increased productivity from cultivated lands   The profound differences in human interactions and subsistence methods associated with the onset of early agricultural practices in the Neolithic have been called the Neolithic Revolution  a term coined in the 1920s by the Australian archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe   One potential benefit of the development and increasing sophistication of farming technology was the possibility of producing surplus crop yields  in other words  food supplies in excess of the immediate needs of the community  Surpluses could be stored for later use  or possibly traded for other necessities or luxuries  Agricultural life afforded securities that pastoral life could not  and sedentary farming populations grew faster than nomadic   However  early farmers were also adversely affected in times of famine  such as may be caused by drought or pests  In instances where agriculture had become the predominant way of life  the sensitivity to these shortages could be particularly acute  affecting agrarian populations to an extent that otherwise may not have been routinely experienced by prior hunter gatherer communities  Nevertheless  agrarian communities generally proved successful  and their growth and the expansion of territory under cultivation continued   Another significant change undergone by many of these newly agrarian communities was one of diet  Pre agrarian diets varied by region  season  available local plant and animal resources and degree of pastoralism and hunting  Post agrarian diet was restricted to a limited package of successfully cultivated cereal grains  plants and to a variable extent domesticated animals and animal products  Supplementation of diet by hunting and gathering was to variable degrees precluded by the increase in population above the carrying capacity of the land and a high sedentary local population concentration  In some cultures  there would have been a significant shift toward increased starch and plant protein  The relative nutritional benefits and drawbacks of these dietary changes and their overall impact on early societal development is still debated   In addition  increased population density  decreased population mobility  increased continuous proximity to domesticated animals  and continuous occupation of comparatively population dense sites would have altered sanitation needs and patterns of disease   6  Technology  The identifying characteristic of Neolithic technology is the use of polished or ground stone tools  in contrast to the flaked stone tools used during the Paleolithic era   Neolithic people were skilled farmers  manufacturing a range of tools necessary for the tending  harvesting and processing of crops  such as sickle blades and grinding stones  and food production  e g  pottery  bone implements   They were also skilled manufacturers of a range of other types of stone tools and ornaments  including projectile points  beads  and statuettes  But what allowed forest clearance on a large scale was the polished stone axe above all other tools  Together with the adze  fashioning wood for shelter  structures and canoes for example  this enabled them to exploit their newly won farmland   Neolithic peoples in the Levant  Anatolia  Syria  northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia were also accomplished builders  utilizing mud brick to construct houses and villages  At Çatal höyük  houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals  In Europe  long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed  Elaborate tombs were built for the dead  These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland  where there are many thousand still in existence  Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps  henges  flint mines and cursus monuments  It was also important to figure out ways of preserving food for future months  such as fashioning relatively airtight containers  and using substances like salt as preservatives   The peoples of the Americas and the Pacific mostly retained the Neolithic level of tool technology until the time of European contact  Exceptions include copper hatchets and spearheads in the Great Lakes region   7  Clothing  Most clothing appears to have been made of animal skins  as indicated by finds of large numbers of bone and antler pins which are ideal for fastening leather  Wool cloth and linen might have become available during the later Neolithic  as suggested by finds of perforated stones which  depending on size  may have served as spindle whorls or loom weights  The clothing worn in the Neolithic Age might be similar to that worn by Ötzi the Iceman  although he was not Neolithic  since he belonged to the later Copper age    8  Early settlements  Neolithic human settlements include   Göbekli Tepe
