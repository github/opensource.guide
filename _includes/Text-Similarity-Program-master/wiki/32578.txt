Vermont    locally  or   is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States  Vermont is the 6th smallest in area and the 2nd least populous of the 50 United States  It is the only New England state not bordering the Atlantic Ocean  Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont s western border  which it shares with the state of New York  The Green Mountains are within the state  Vermont is bordered by Massachusetts to the south  New Hampshire to the east across the Connecticut River  New York to the west  and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north   Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes  the Algonquian speaking Abenaki and the Iroquois   much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by France during its early colonial period  France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years  War  in the United States  referred to as the French and Indian War   For many years  the nearby colonies  especially New Hampshire and New York  disputed control of the area  then called the New Hampshire Grants    Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia  which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state  the Vermont Republic  Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War  the republic lasted for fourteen years  Aside from the Thirteen Colonies  Vermont is one of only four U S  states  along with Texas  Hawaii  and California  to have been a sovereign state in its past  In 1791  Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state  the first in addition to the original 13 Colonies  Vermont was the first state to partially abolish slavery while still independent   Vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States  The state capital is Montpelier with a population of 7 855  making it the least populous state capital in the country  Vermont s most populous city is Burlington  with a 2013 population of 42 284  which makes it the least populous city in the United States to be the largest city within a state  Burlington s metropolitan area has a population of 214 796  Vermont is one of the most racially homogeneous states  94 3% of its population identified as white in 2010   1  Geography  Vermont is located in the New England region in the eastern United States and comprises   making it the 45th largest state  It is the only state that does not have any buildings taller than   Land comprises and water comprises   making it the 43rd largest in land area and the 47th in water area  In total area  it is larger than El Salvador and smaller than Haiti   The west bank of the Connecticut River marks the eastern  New Hampshire  border of the state  the river is part of New Hampshire   41% of Vermont s land area is part of the Connecticut River s watershed   Lake Champlain  the major lake in Vermont  is the sixth largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state  From north to south  Vermont is long  Its greatest width  from east to west  is at the Canadian border  the narrowest width is at the Massachusetts line  The width averages   The state s geographic center is approximately three miles  5 km  east of Roxbury  in Washington County  There are fifteen US federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada   The origin of the name  Vermont  is uncertain  but likely comes from the French les Verts Monts  meaning  the Green Mountains   Thomas Young introduced it in 1777  Some authorities say that the mountains were called green because they were more forested than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York  others say that the predominance of mica quartz chlorite schist  a green hued metamorphosed shale  is the reason  The Green Mountain range forms a north–south spine running most of the length of the state  slightly west of its center  In the southwest portion of the state are the Taconic Mountains  the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast  In the northwest  near Lake Champlain  is the fertile Champlain Valley  In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen   Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year round alpine ecosystems  including Mount Mansfield  the highest mountain in the state  Killington Peak  the second highest  Camel s Hump  the state s third highest  and Mount Abraham  the fifth highest peak  About 77% of the state is covered by forest  the rest is covered in meadow  uplands  lakes  ponds  and marshes   Areas in Vermont administered by the National Park Service include the Marsh Billings Rockefeller National Historical Park  in Woodstock  and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail   1 1  Cities  Vermont has nine incorporated cities  listed by population   1 2  Largest towns  Although these towns are large enough to be considered cities  they are not incorporated as such   1 3  Climate  The annual mean temperature for the state is   Vermont has a humid continental climate  with muddy springs  in general a mild early summer  hot Augusts  it has colorful autumns  Vermont s hills reveal red  orange  and  on sugar maples  gold foliage as cold weather approaches  Winters are colder at higher elevations  It has a Köppen climate classification of Dfb  similar to Minsk  Stockholm  and Fargo   The rural northeastern section  dubbed the  Northeast Kingdom   often averages colder than the southern areas of the state during winter  The annual snowfall averages between depending on elevation   Vermont is the seventh coldest state in the country  In winter  until typical El Nino conditions  Vermont s winters are  too cold to snow   the air is too cold to contain sufficient moisture to prompt precipitation   The highest recorded temperature was   at Vernon  on July 4  1911  the lowest recorded temperature was   at Bloomfield  on December 30  1933  this is the lowest temperature recorded in New England  Big Black River  Maine  also recorded a verified in 2009   The agricultural growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days   The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range between zone 3b  no colder than   in the Northeast Kingdom and northern part of the state and zone 5b  no colder than   in the southern part of the state   The state receives between 2 000 and 2 400 hours of sunshine annually   1 4  Geology  There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont  Categorized by geological and physical attributes  they are the Northeastern Highlands  the Green Mountains  the Taconic Mountains  the Champlain Lowlands  and the Vermont Piedmont   About 500 million years ago  Vermont was part of Laurentia and located in the tropics   The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont  formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period  or orogeny   Subsequently  about years ago  the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were tall  three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas  The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the Champlain Thrust  running north–south to the west of the mountains  now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain   It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation   As a result of tectonic formation  Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods  Western Vermont mainly from the older Pre Cambrian and Cambrian material   Several large deposits within the state contain granite   Some buildings in Germany  Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi are constructed almost primarily of Vermont granite  Rock of Ages quarries two kinds of granite in Vermont  Barre Gray and Bethel White   The remains of the Chazy Formation can be observed in Isle La Motte  It was one of the first tropical reefs  It is the site of the limestone Fisk Quarry  which contains a collection of ancient marine fossils such as stromatoporoids that date back to years ago  It is believed that at one point  Vermont was connected to Africa  Pangaea  and the fossils found and the rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are further evidence of the Pangaea theory   In the past four centuries  Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes rarely centered under Vermont  the highest being a Richter magnitude scale 6 0 in 1952   1 5  Fauna  The state contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians  89 species of fish  of which 12 are non native  193 species of breeding birds  58 species of mammals  more than 15 000 insect species  and 2 000 higher plant species  plus fungi  algae  and 75 different types of natural communities   Vermont contains one species of venomous snake  the Eastern timber rattlesnake  which is confined to a few acres in western Rutland County   By the mid 19th century  wild turkeys were exterminated in the state through overhunting and destruction of habitat  Sixteen were re introduced in 1969 and had grown to an estimated flock of 45 000 in 2009  in 2013  hunters killed 6 968 of these   Since 1970  reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced environment for  and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock  brown thrasher  Eastern towhee  willow flycatcher  golden winged warbler  blue winged warbler  field sparrow  and Baltimore oriole   DDT destroyed the eggshells of ospreys  which resulted in their disappearance from the state  This species began reviving in 1998  As of 2010  they were no longer endangered in the state   White nose syndrome killed an estimated two thirds of all cave wintering bats in the state from 2008 to 2010   The New England cottontail disappeared from the state in the early 1970s  out competed by the eastern cottontail rabbit  imported in the 1800s for hunting  and which is better able to detect predators   Out of a total of 33 species of bumblebee  there were 19 or 20 in the state in 2013  Bombus terricola  the yellow banded bumblebee   although once common in Vermont  has not been seen in most of its range since 1999 and is now absent from Vermont  For honey bees  Colony collapse disorder has affected bee population in the state  as elsewhere   Invasive species included the Asian spotted wing drosophila  which started damaging berry crops in 2012  Vermont was the initial point of invasion in New England   Since 2010  the Vermont Department of Health has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct blood serum surveys of the state s deer and moose populations  Tests for eastern equine encephalitis virus antibodies were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont s counties  In 2012  12% of deer and 2 4% of moose tested positive   1 6  Flora  Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  Much of the state  in particular the Green Mountains  is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England Acadian forests  The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests  The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by Northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak   Invasive wild honeysuckle has been deemed a threat to the state s forests  native species of plants  and wildlife   Many of Vermont s rivers  including the Winooski River  have been subjected to man made barriers to prevent flooding   Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry  Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain  asian longhorn beetles  pear thrips  and  in 2011  an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat bark in the winter  These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup  The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years  The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples  in effect forcing the sugar maples to  migrate  north to Canada   2  History  2 1  Native American occupancy  Between 8500 and 7000 BCE  at the time of the Champlain Sea  Native Americans inhabited and hunted in present day Vermont  During the Archaic period  from the 8th millennium BCE to 1000 BCE  Native Americans migrated year round  During the Woodland period  from 1000 BCE to 1600 CE  villages and trade networks were established  and ceramic and bow and arrow technology was developed  In the western part of the state there lived a small population of Algonquian speaking tribes  including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples  Sometime between 1500 and 1600 CE  the Iroquois  based in present day New York  drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont  later using the area as a hunting ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki  The population in 1500 CE was estimated to be around 10 000 people   2 2  Colonial  The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been Jacques Cartier in 1535  On July 30  1609  French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed Vermont as part of New France  In 1666  French settlers erected Fort Lamotte  the first European settlement in Vermont   In 1638  a  violent  earthquake was felt throughout New England  centered in the St  Lawrence Valley  This was the first seismic event noted in Vermont   In 1690  a group of Dutch British settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney Point west of present day Addison   During Dummer s War  the first permanent British settlement was established in 1724  with the construction of Fort Dummer  It was to protect the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro   From 1731 to 1734  the French constructed Fort St  Frédéric  which gave the French control of the New France Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley  With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754  the North American front of the Seven Years  War between the French and English  the French began construction of Fort Carillon at present day Ticonderoga  New York in 1755  The British failed to take Fort St  Frédéric or Fort Carillon between 1755 and 1758  In 1759  a combined force of 12 000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon  after which the French abandoned Fort St  Frédéric  Amherst constructed Fort Crown Point next to the remains of the Fort St  Frédéric  securing British control over the area   Following France s loss in the French and Indian War  through the 1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British  Colonial settlement was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians  in order to try to end encroachment on Native American lands  The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north eastward to Lake Memphremagog  With the end of the war  new settlers arrived in Vermont  Ultimately  Massachusetts  New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area   On March 20  1764  King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River  north of Massachusetts  and south of 45 degrees north latitude  In 1770  Ethan Allen  his brothers Ira and Levi  and Seth Warner  recruited an informal militia known as the Green Mountain Boys to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against newcomers from New York   When New York refused to recognize the land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants  towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth   dissatisfied New Hampshire settlers organized in opposition  This led to their proclaiming an independent Vermont on January 15  1777  during the American Revolutionary War   2 3  Sovereignty  On January 15  1777  representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont  For the first six months of its existence  it was called The Republic of New Connecticut   On June 2  1777  a second convention of 72 delegates met to adopt the name  Vermont   This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian  Dr  Thomas Young  friend and mentor of Ethan Allen  who wrote to them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States of America as the 14th state  On July 4  the Constitution of Vermont was drafted at the Windsor Tavern  it was adopted by the delegates on July 8  This was among the first written constitutions in North America to partially ban slavery  provide for universal adult male suffrage  and require support of public schools  It was in effect from 1777 to 1791  Slavery was fully banned by state law on November 25  1858  less than three years before the American Civil War   2 4  Revolutionary War  The Battle of Bennington  fought on August 16  1777  was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States  A combined American force  under General John Stark s command  attacked the British column at Hoosick  New York  just across the border from Bennington  It killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment  General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6 000 man force at Saratoga  New York  on October 17 that year   The battles of Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army  The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday   The Battle of Hubbardton  July 7  1777  was the only Revolutionary battle in present day Vermont  Although the Continental forces were technically defeated  the British forces were damaged to the point that they did not pursue the Americans  retreating from Fort Ticonderoga  any further   2 5  Statehood  Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for 14 years  The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788 and operated a statewide postal service  Thomas Chittenden was the Governor in 1778–89 and in 1790–91  The state was obliged to solve conflicting property ownership disputes with New Yorkers  Vermont petitioned Congress to become a state in the federal union  Congress acted on February 18  1791 to admit Vermont to the union as the 14th state as of March 4  1791 s and become the first to enter the Union after the original 13 colonies  Vermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836   2 6  The Civil War  From the mid 1850s on  Vermonters became activists opposing slavery  which they had previously worked to contain in the South  Abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens developed as a national leader and later promoted Radical Republican goals after the American Civil War  While the Whig Party shriveled  and the Republican Party emerged  Vermont supported Republican candidates  In 1860 it voted for Abraham Lincoln for US President  giving him the largest margin of victory of any state   During the American Civil War  Vermont sent more than 34 000 men into United States service  Almost 5 200 Vermonters  15 percent  were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease  a higher percentage than any other state   The northernmost land action of the war  the St  Albans Raid  took place in Vermont   2 7  Postbellum era to present  2 7 1  Demographic changes  Beginning in the mid 19th century  Vermont attracted numerous Irish  Scots Irish and Italian immigrants  adding to its residents of mostly English and French Canadian ancestry  Many migrated to Barre  where the men worked as stonecutters of granite  for which there was a national market  Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states  Many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century to support their families  Such facilities helped absorb new residents  who peaked between 1890 and 1900  Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity  but sometimes they boarded with others   2 7 2  Natural disasters  The state has suffered some natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes  extensive rain and flooding  Large scale flooding occurred in early November 1927  During this incident  84 people died  including the state s lieutenant governor   The 1938 New England hurricane in the fall of that year blew down of trees  one third of the total forest at the time in New England  Three billion board feet were salvaged  Today many of the older trees in Vermont are about 75 years old  dating from after this storm   Another flood occurred in 1973  causing the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage   The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by Tropical Storm Irene  Heavy rains caused flooding in many towns built in narrow river valleys  The governor described it as one of the worst natural disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries  second only to the flood of 1927   2 7 3  Political changes  Vermont approved women s suffrage decades before it became part of the national constitution  Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18  1880  when women were granted limited suffrage  They were first allowed to vote in town elections  and later in state legislative races   In 1964  the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v  Sims required  one man  one vote  redistricting in all states  this resulted in major changes in Vermont  This ruling required city residents to be given an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state  Vermont had long been dominated by rural districts  as were several Southern states in those years  Until that time  apportionment was based on county jurisdictions  which had given more power to rural counties and decreased representation of urban residents  This arrangement had meant that urban issues were not considered in proportion to the number of people affected by them   In July 2000 Vermont was the first state to introduce civil unions  In 2009 the Vermont became the first state to legislate same sex marriage  unforced by court challenge or ruling   3  Demographics  3 1  Population  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Vermont was 626 562 on July 1  2014  a 0 13% increase since the 2010 United States Census  The center of population of Vermont is located in Washington County  in the town of Warren   According to the United States Census Bureau  as of 2014  Vermont has an estimated population of 626 562  which is an increase of 821  or 0 13% percent  from the prior year and an increase of 821  or 0 13% percent  since 2010  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 7 148 people  33 606 births minus 26 458 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 7 889 people into the state  In 2006 it had the second lowest birthrate in the nation  42 1000 women   Net migration from outside the United States resulted in an increase of 4 359 people  and net migration from within the country produced an increase of 3 530 people  As of 2009  47 8% of Vermont s population was born outside the state  with first and second generation Vermonters representing a majority of the population  The changing demographics between those with multi generational ties to the state and those who are newcomers  bringing different values with them  has resulted in a degree of tension between the two perspectives  This tension is expressed in the terms   Woodchuck   being applied to those established in the state  and  Flatlander   applied to the newcomers  Vermont is the least populous New England state  As of 2012  Vermont is one of only two states in the U S  that has fewer people than the District of Columbia  the other state is Wyoming    From 2010 to 2013  16 out of Vermont s 251 towns experienced an increase in population  All towns in Chittenden increased with the exception of Burlington  More than 180 towns experienced a decrease which hasn t happened since the mid 19th century   In 2009  12 6 percent of people over 15 were divorced  This was the fifth highest percentage in the nation  As of 2008  the median age of Vermonters was 40 6 and that of the work force was 43 7  compared with the national average of 41 1 years   3 2  Race and gender  Vermont s population is   50 8% female  49 2% male Among the 50 states and the District of Columbia  Vermont ranks   2nd highest proportion of non Hispanic Whites  94 3%   2nd oldest median age  41st highest proportion of Asians  1 3%   49th highest proportion of Hispanics  1 5%   48th highest proportion of Blacks  1 0%   29th highest proportion of Native Americans  0 4%   39th highest proportion of people of mixed race  1 7%   28th highest proportion of males  49 2%   24th highest proportion of females  50 8%  The above percentages are from the 2010 Census   3 3  Ethnicity and language  The largest ancestry groups are   23 9% French or French Canadian  18 6% English  17 9% Irish  10 3% German  7 5% Italian  7 0% American  5 0% Scottish  3 9% Polish  2 7% Scotch Irish  1 9% Swedish  1 6% Dutch  1 4% Russian  1 4% Welsh Residents of British ancestry  especially English  live throughout most of Vermont  The northern part of the state maintains a significant percentage of people of French Canadian ancestry  Some vestiges of a Vermont accent are heard but the population has become more homogenized around General American in recent years   According to the 2000 U S  Census  2 54 percent of the population aged five and older speak French at home  while 1 percent speak Spanish   3 4  Religion  According to 2012 and 2014 Gallup polls  Vermont ranked the least religious state in the U S   with 23% of the residents considering themselves  very religious   In 2008  just over half of Vermont residents identified themselves as Christians  The largest single religious body in the state is the Roman Catholic Church  According to the ARDA in 2010  the Catholic Church had 128 293 members   Almost one third of Vermonters were self identified Protestants  The Congregational United Church of Christ is the largest Protestant denomination with 16 392 members  Vermont has the largest percentage of this denomination of any state  The number of congregations of the United Church of Christ  135  was larger than the number of Catholic congregations  129    The second largest Protestant denomination is the United Methodist Church with 14 710 members  followed by the Baptists with 7 178 members   Twenty four percent of Vermonters attended church regularly  This low is matched nationally only by New Hampshire   In 2008  34 percent of Vermonters claimed no religion  this is the highest percentage in the nation  A survey suggested that people in Vermont and New Hampshire  which were polled jointly  were less likely to attend weekly services and are less likely to believe in God  54 percent  than people in the rest of the nation  71 percent   The two states were at the lowest levels among states in religious commitment  About 23 percent of the respondents attended religious service at least once a week  39 percent nationally   Thirty six percent said religion is very important to them  56 percent nationally    Joseph Smith  Jr  and Brigham Young—the first two leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints—were both born in Vermont  A memorial to Joseph Smith  at his birthplace in Sharon  is maintained by the LDS church and draws about 70 000 visitors annually    the church reports 4 386 members in twelve congregations throughout the state   Vermont may have the highest concentration of western convert Buddhists in the country  Several Buddhist retreat centers are located in the state   2 000 people of the Islamic faith are estimated to live in the state   4  Economy  In 2007  Vermont was ranked by Forbes magazine as 32nd best among states in which to do business  It was 30th the previous year  In 2008  an economist said that the state had  a really stagnant economy  which is what we are forecasting for Vermont for the next 30 years   In May 2010  Vermont s 6 2 percent unemployment rate was the fourth lowest in the nation  This rate reflects the second sharpest decline among the 50 states since the prior May   According to the 2010 U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis report  Vermont s gross state product  GSP  was   Not accounting for size  this places the state 50th among the 50 states  It stood 34th in per capita GSP   Components of GSP were   Government – $3 billion  13 4%   Real Estate  Rental and Leasing –  11 6%   Durable goods manufacturing –  9 6%   Health Care and Social Assistance –  9 4%   Retail trade – $1 9 billion  8 4%   Finance and Insurance – $1 3 billion  5 9%   Construction – $1 2 billion  5 5%   Professional and technical services –  5 5%   Wholesale trade – $1 1 billion  5 1%   Accommodations and Food Services –  4 5%   Information – $958 million  4 2%   Non durable goods manufacturing –  3 1%   Other Services – $563 million  2 4%   Utilities – $553 million  2 4%   Educational Services – $478 million  2 1%   Transportation and Warehousing –  2 1%   Administrative and Waste Services –  1 9%   Agriculture  forestry  fishing  and hunting –  1 6%   Arts  Entertainment  and Recreation –   8%   Mining – $100 million   4%   Management of Companies – $35 million   2%  Canada was Vermont s largest foreign trade partner in 2007  The state s second largest foreign trade partner was Taiwan  The state had worth of commerce with Québec   One measure of economic activity is retail sales  The state had in 2007  In 2008  8 631 new businesses were registered in Vermont  a decline of 500 from 2007   4 1  Personal income  The median household income from 2002 to 2004 was $45 692  This was 15th nationally  The median wage in the state in 2008 was $15 31 hourly or $31 845 annually  In 2007 about 80 percent of the 68 000 Vermonters who qualify for food stamps received them  40 percent of seniors 75 years or older live on annual incomes of $21 660 or less  In 2011  15 2% of Vermonters received food stamps  This compares to 14 8% nationally   In 2011  91 000 seniors received an annual average of $14 000 from Social Security  This comprised 59% of the average senior s income  This contributed $1 7 billion to the state s economy   4 2  Agriculture  Agriculture contributed 2 2% of the state s domestic product in 2000  In 2000  about 3 percent of the state s working population engaged in agriculture   Over the past two centuries  logging has fallen off as over cutting and the exploitation of other forests made Vermont s forest less attractive  The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont s forests due to ecological succession  Today  most of Vermont s forests are secondary  The state and non profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management  Over 78 percent of the land area of the state is forested  Over 85 percent of that area is non industrial  private forestland owned by individuals or families  In 2011 were harvested in Vermont  Most of it was processed within the state  In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half since 2005  The state estimates that remain in the state   Dairy farming is the primary source of agricultural income  In the last half of the 20th century  developers had plans to build condos and houses on what was relatively inexpensive  open land  Vermont s government responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont s dairy industry  Still  the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85 percent from the 11 206 dairy farms operating in 1947  In 2003 there were fewer than 1 500 dairy farms in the state  in 2006 there were 1 138  and in 2007 there were 1 087  The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10 percent annually   The number of cattle in Vermont had declined by 40 percent  however  milk production has doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow  While milk production rose  Vermont s market share declined  Within a group of states supplying the Boston and New York City markets  Vermont was third in market share  with 10 6 percent  New York has 44 9 percent and Pennsylvania has 32 9 percent  In 2007  dairy farmers received a record $23 60 for of milk  This dropped in 2008 to $17  The average dairy farm produced pounds of milk annually in 2008   The dairy barn remains an iconic image of Vermont  but the 87 percent decrease in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that preservation of the dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy  The Vermont Barn Census  organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs  has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number  condition  and features of barns throughout Vermont   In 2009  there were 543 organic farms  Twenty percent of the dairy farms were organic and 23 percent  128  vegetable farms were organic  Organic farming increased in 2006–07  but leveled off in 2008–09  Nor are any expected for 2010   A significant amount of milk is shipped into the Boston market  Therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards  Without this certification  a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the bulk market   An important and growing part of Vermont s economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods  fancy foods  and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont  brand   which the state  manages and defends  Examples of these specialty exports include Cabot Cheese  the Vermont Teddy Bear Company  Fine Paints of Europe  Vermont Butter and Cheese Company  several micro breweries  ginseng growers  Burton Snowboards  Lake Champlain Chocolates  King Arthur Flour  and Ben and Jerry s Ice Cream   There were about 2 000 maple products producers in 2010  In 2001  Vermont produced 275 000 US gallons  1 040 000 L  of maple syrup  about one quarter of U S  production  For 2005 that number was accounting for 37 percent of national production  This rose to in 2009  The state s share of the nation s production rose to 42% in 2013  It had the second lowest price at $33 40 gallon   Wine industry in Vermont started in 1985  As of 2007  there were 14 wineries   Farms in the state were estimated to have hired 2 000 illegal immigrants as of 2005  largely tolerated by local police and U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement   4 3  Manufacturing  Vermont s largest for profit employer  IBM  in Essex Junction  provides 25 percent of all manufacturing jobs in Vermont  employing 5 000 workers in 2013  It is responsible for of the state s annual economy   A 2010 University of Connecticut study reported that Vermont  Rhode Island  and New Hampshire tied as the most costly states in the U S  for manufacturers   4 4  Health  An increasingly aging population is expected to improve the position of aging services and health care in the state economy  In 2013  Fletcher Allen Health Care  with 7 100 employees  was the second largest employer of people in the state and the largest private employer   In 2010  all of Vermont s hospitals billed patients $3 76 billion  and collected $2 billion  92 000 people are enrolled in Medicare  In 2011  Medicare spent $740 million on health care in the state   4 5  Housing  In 2007 Vermont was the 17th highest state in the nation for mortgage affordability  However  in 41 other states  inhabitants contributed within plus or minus 4 percent of Vermont s 18 4 percent of household income to a mortgage   Housing prices did not rise much during the early 2000s  As a result  the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either  While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007  the state stood 50th—the most favorable—in ratio of foreclosure filings to households  While housing sales dropped annually from 2004 to 2008  prices continued to rise   In 2007  Vermont was best in the country for construction of new energy efficient homes as evaluated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Energy Star program  However  about 60 percent of Vermont homes were heated with oil in 2008  In August 2008  the cost in Vermont of various heating sources per BTU ranged from $14 39 for cord wood to $43 50 for kerosene   While the number of houses sold in the state has dropped from 8 318 in 2004 to 8 120 in 2005  6 919 in 2006  and 5 820 in 2007  the average price has

were $33 385 in 2006 constant dollars and remained there in 2010  the nation  $36 871   4 7  Insurance  Captive insurance plays an increasingly large role in Vermont s economy  With this form of alternative insurance  large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks  thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered  There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies  According to the Insurance Information Institute  Vermont in 2009 was the world s third largest domicile for captive insurance companies  following Bermuda and the Cayman Islands  In 2009  there were 560 such companies  In 2010  the state had 900 such companies   4 8  Tourism  Tourism is an important industry to the state  Some of the largest ski areas in New England are located in Vermont  Skiers and

to December 16  Waterfowl hunting is also controlled by federal law   4 9  Quarrying  The towns of Rutland and Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U S  For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U S   the Stonecutters Association  of about 500 members  The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset  The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters in the late 19th century from Italy  Scotland  and Ireland  Barre is the location of the Rock of Ages quarry  the largest dimension stone granite quarry in the United States  Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country  The highest quarrying revenues result from the production of dimension stone  The Rock of Ages Quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country  The work of the sculptors of this corporation can be seen down the road at the Hope Cemetery  where there are

highest in the states  34 4 percent of its bridges were rated deficient or obsolete  the 8th worst in the nation   Individual communities and counties have public transit  but their breadth of coverage is frequently limited  Greyhound Lines services a number of small towns  Two Amtrak trains serve Vermont  the Vermonter and the Ethan Allen Express  In 2011  Amtrak evaluated the track used by the Ethan Allen Express between Rutland and Whitehall  as the worst in the nation   Trucks weighing less than can use Vermont s interstate highways  The limit for state roads is   This means that vehicles too heavy for the turnpikes can legally only use secondary roads   In 1968 Vermont outlawed the use of billboards for advertisement along its roads  It is one of four states in the US to have done this  along with Hawaii  Maine  and Alaska   5 1  Major routes  The state has of highways under its control   For a more detailed explanation see a List of Routes in Vermont   5 1 1  North–south

in law  In 2010  there were about 150 methane digesters in the nation  Vermont led the nation with six online   While Vermont paid the lowest rates in New England for power in 2007  it is still ranked among the highest eleven states in the nation  that is  about 16 percent higher than the national average   In 2009  the state had the highest energy rates for energy  including heating  in the U S  and the worst affordability gap nationwide   In 2009  the state received one third  400 MW  of its power from Hydro Québec and one third from Vermont Yankee  In total  the state got half its power from Canada and other states  It received 75 percent of the power it generated in the state from Vermont Yankee  The state is part of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council for the distribution of electricity   The state s two largest electric utilities  Green Mountain Power Corporation and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation  together serve 80 percent of Vermont households   Vermont experts estimate that the state has the capacity to ultimately generate from 134 to 175 megawatts of electricity from hydro power   In 2006  the total summer generating capacity of Vermont was 1 117 megawatts  In 2005  the inhabitants of the state used an average of of electricity per capita  Another source says that each household consumed annually in 2008   Vermont has the highest rate of

and the General Assembly serve two year terms including the governor and 30 senators  There are no term limits for any office  The state capital is in Montpelier   There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont  towns  cities  and villages  Like most of New England  there is slight provision for autonomous county government  Counties and county seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services such as state courts  with several elected officers such as a state s Attorney and sheriff  All county services are directly funded by the state of Vermont  The next effective governmental level below state government are municipalities  Most of these are towns   8 1  Finances and taxation  Vermont is the only state in the union not to have a balanced budget requirement  yet Vermont has had a balanced budget every year since 1991  In 2007  Moody s gave its top bond credit rating  Aaa  to the state   The state uses enterprise funds for operations that are similar to private business enterprises  The Vermont Lottery Commission  the Liquor Control Fund  and the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund  are the largest of the State s enterprise funds   In 2007  Vermont was the 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local taxation  with a per capita load of $3 681  The national average was $3 447  However  CNNMoney ranked Vermont highest in the nation based on the percentage of per capita income  The rankings showed Vermont had a per capita tax load of $5 387  14 1 percent of the per capita income of $38 306   Vermont collects a state personal income tax in a progressive structure of five different income brackets  with marginal tax rates ranging from 3 6 percent to 9 5 percent  In 2008

taxes to be redistributed to school districts lacking adequate support   8 2  Politics  Vermonters have been known for their political independence  Vermont is one of four states  aside from the original Thirteen Colonies  that were once independent nations  the others being Texas  California  and Hawaii   It has sometimes voted contrarian in national elections  Notably  Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from the Anti Masonic Party  and Vermont was one of only two states to vote against Franklin D  Roosevelt in all four of his presidential campaigns  the other was Maine    Vermont s history of independent political thought has led to movements for the establishment of the Second Vermont Republic and other plans advocating secession   8 2 1  State politics  Republicans dominated local Vermont politics from the party s founding in 1854 until the mid 1970s  Prior to the 1960s  rural interests dominated the legislature  As a result  cities  particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski  were neglected and fell into decay  People began to move out to newer suburbs   Vermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party  Ethno political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State  Americans of French descent overwhelmingly vote Democratic  and are the largest ethnicity in Vermont  Vermonters of English descent   sometimes known as the “Yankee” Vermonters  overwhelmingly vote Republican  Americans of English descent make up between a fifth and a quarter of the state and Americans of French descent make roughly one third of the state  All other ethnicities in the state breakdown roughly 50 50 along political lines  however the predominance of French Canadian descended Vermonters who vote Democrat the overwhelming majority of the time has led to a dwindling of the “Yankee Republicanism” for which Vermont was once synonymous  The Irish Catholic vote has fluctuated during this time  while the French Canadian vote has remained solidly Democrat and the vote of the “Yankee” Vermonters of English descent has remained solidly Republican  Since 1992 Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential election  Prior to 1992 Vermont has voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election with the exception of 1964   A series of one man  one vote decisions made by the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s required states to redraw their legislative districts to more fairly reflect population  As a result  urban areas in Vermont gained political power   After the legislature was redistricted under one person  one vote in the 1960s  it passed legislation to accommodate the new arrivals to the state  This legislation was the Land Use and Development Law  Act 250  in 1970  The law  which was the first of its kind in the nation  created nine District Environmental Commissions consisting of private citizens  appointed by the Governor  who must approve land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state s environment and many small communities  As a result of Act 250  Vermont was the last state to get a Wal Mart  there are now five Wal Marts in the state  as of December 2013  but only two   in Williston and St  Albans   were newly built from the ground up   Because of the successful attempts to dilute what is perceived as the original intent of Act 250  and other development pressures  Vermont has been designated one of America s most  endangered historic places  by the National Trust for Historic Preservation   In 1995  the state banned the spreading of manure from December 15 to April 1  to prevent runoff and protect the water  Therefore farms must have environmentally approved facilities to store manure during this time frame   While the state voted largely Democratic  Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election   A controversy dating from 1999 has been over the adoption of civil unions  an institution which grants same sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state  but not federal  level  In Baker v  Vermont  1999   the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that  under the Constitution of Vermont  the state must either allow same sex marriage or provide a separate but equal status for them  The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of civil union  the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Howard Dean  In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas s veto to allow same sex marriage  becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same sex marriage through legislation  In September 2009  Vermont became the fourth state in which same sex couples could marry   In 2007  the state s House of Representatives rejected a measure which would have legalized assisted suicide for the terminally ill  by a vote of 82–63  Then with the governor s signature on May 20  2013  Vermont became the fourth state to pass a “death with dignity” law—the first to be passed through legislation rather than by ballot initiative   Minor parties and Independents flourish  Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont  As a result  voters often have extensive choices for general elections  This has resulted in the election to Mayor of Burlington and then to U S  Congressman of Bernie Sanders  then a Socialist  and later  as an Independent  to U S  Senator   A political issue has been Act 60  which balances taxation for education funding  This has resulted in the town of Killington trying to secede from Vermont and join New Hampshire due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden   The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person to walk  fish and hunt  on any unposted  unfenced land  That is  trespass must be proven by the owner  it is not automatically assumed   The state is an alcoholic beverage control state  In 2007  through the Vermont Department of Liquor Control  it took in over from the sale and distribution of liquor   In 2013  Vermont became the 17th state to decriminalize marijuana  The statute makes possession of less than an ounce of the drug punishable by a small fine rather than arrest and possible jail time   In 2014  Vermont became the first state to call for a constitutional convention to overturn the Supreme Court s Citizens United decision   In 2014 Vermont became the first state to mandate labeling of genetically modified organisms in the retail food supply   8 2 2  Elections to federal office  Historically  Vermont was considered one of the most reliably Republican
