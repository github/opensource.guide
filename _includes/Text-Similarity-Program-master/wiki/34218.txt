The X Men are a fictional team of superheroes that appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics  The X Men were created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby  and were first published in 1963  They are among Marvel Comics  most popular and lucrative intellectual properties  appearing in numerous books  television shows  films  and video games   The X Men are  mutants   a subspecies of humans who are born with superhuman abilities  They fight for peace and equality between normal humans and mutants in a world where antimutant bigotry is fierce and widespread   1  Publication history  Around 1963  with the success of Spider Man in Amazing Fantasy  as well as the Hulk  Thor  Iron Man  and the Fantastic Four  creator Stan Lee wanted to create another group of superheroes but was getting tired of coming up with new origins for how they got their powers   Lee devised the series title after Marvel publisher Martin Goodman turned down the initial name   The Mutants   stating that readers would not know what a  mutant  was  Within the Marvel Universe  the X Men are widely regarded to have been named after Professor Xavier himself  Xavier however claims that the name  X Men  was never chosen to be a self tribute  The name is also linked to the  X Gene   an unknown gene that causes the mutant evolution  The original explanation for the name  as provided by Xavier  is that mutants  possess an extra power    one which ordinary humans do not   That is why I call my students    X Men  for EX tra power    1 1  1960s  Early X Men issues introduced the original team composed of Cyclops  Marvel Girl  Beast  Angel and Iceman among a few others  their archenemy Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants featuring Mastermind  Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  and Toad  The comic focused on a common human theme of good versus evil and later included storylines and themes about prejudice and racism  all of which have persisted throughout the series in one form or another  The evil side in the fight was shown in human form and under some sympathetic beginnings via Magneto  a character who was later revealed to have survived Nazi concentration camps only to pursue a hatred for normal humanity  His key followers  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch  were Romani  Only one new member of the X Men was added  Mimic Calvin Rankin  but soon left due to his temporary loss of power   The title lagged in sales behind Marvel s other comic franchises  In 1969  writer Roy Thomas and illustrator Neal Adams rejuvenated the comic book and gave regular roles to two recently introduced characters  Havok Alex Summers  who had been introduced by Roy Thomas before Adams began work on the comic  and Lorna Dane  later called Polaris  created by Arnold Drake and Jim Steranko   However  these later X Men issues failed to attract sales and Marvel stopped producing new stories with issue #66  later reprinting a number of the older comics as issues #67–93   1 2  1970s  In Giant Size X Men #1  1975   writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum introduced a new team that then starred in a revival of The X Men  beginning with issue #94  This new team  however  differed greatly from the original  Unlike in the early issues of the original series  the new team was not made up of teenagers and they also had a more diverse background  Each was from a different country with varying cultural and philosophical beliefs  and all were already well versed in using their mutant powers  several being experienced in combat  The  all new  all different X Men  were led by Cyclops  from the original team  and consisted of the newly created Colossus  from the Soviet Union   Nightcrawler  from West Germany   Storm  from Kenya   and Thunderbird  a Native American from the Apache nation   In addition to the newly created members were three previously introduced characters  Banshee  from Ireland   Sunfire  from Japan   and Wolverine  from Canada   Wolverine eventually became the breakout character on the team and  in terms of comic sales and appearances  the most popular X Men character  A revamped Jean Grey soon rejoined the X Men as the popular  Phoenix   Angel  Beast  Havok  and Polaris also made significant guest appearances   The revived series was illustrated by Cockrum  and later by John Byrne  and written by Chris Claremont  Claremont became the series  longest running contributor  The run met with critical acclaim and produced such early storylines as the death of Thunderbird  the return of the Sentinels and the emergence of Phoenix  the saga of the Starjammers and the fight for control of the M Kraan Crystal  the resurrection of Garokk the Petrified Man  the introduction of Alpha Flight and the Proteus saga  Other characters introduced during this time include Amanda Sefton  Multiple Man  Mystique  and Moira MacTaggert  with her genetic research facility on Muir Island   1 3  1980s  The 1980s began with the comic s best known story arc  the Dark Phoenix Saga  which saw Phoenix manipulated by the illusionist Mastermind and becoming corrupted with an overwhelming lust for power and destruction as the evil Dark Phoenix  Other important storylines included Days of Future Past  the saga of Deathbird and the Brood  the discovery of the Morlocks  the invasion of the Dire Wraiths and The Trial of Magneto  as well as X Men  God Loves  Man Kills  the partial inspiration for the 2003 movie X2  X Men United   By the early 1980s  X Men was Marvel s top selling comic title  Its sales were such that distributors and retailers began using an  X Men index   rating each comic book publication by how many orders it garnered compared to that month s issue of X Men  The growing popularity of Uncanny X Men and the rise of comic book specialty stores led to the introduction of a number of ongoing spin off series nicknamed  X Books   The first of these was The New Mutants  soon followed by Alpha Flight  X Factor  Excalibur  and a solo Wolverine title  When Claremont conceived a story arc  the Mutant Massacre  which was too long to run in the monthly X Men  editor Louise Simonson decided to have it overlap into several X Books  The story was a major financial success  and when the later Fall of the Mutants was similarly successful  the marketing department declared that the X Men lineup would hold such crossovers annually   Throughout the decade  Uncanny X Men was written solely by Chris Claremont  and illustrated for long runs by John Byrne  Dave Cockrum  Paul Smith  John Romita  Jr   and Marc Silvestri  Additions to the X Men during this time were Kitty Pryde Shadowcat  Dazzler  Forge  Longshot  Psylocke  Rogue  Rachel Summers Phoenix  and Jubilee  In a controversial move  Professor X relocated to outer space to be with Lilandra  Majestrix of the Shi ar Empire  in 1986  Magneto then joined the X Men in Xavier s place and became the director of the New Mutants  This period also included the emergence of the Hellfire Club  the arrival of the mysterious Madelyne Pryor  and the villains Apocalypse  Mister Sinister  Mojo  and Sabretooth   1 4  1990s  In 1991  Marvel revised the entire lineup of X Books  centered on the launch of a second X Men series  simply titled X Men  With the return of Xavier and the original X Men to the team  the roster was split into two strike forces  Cyclops   Blue Team   chronicled in X Men  and Storm s  Gold Team   in Uncanny X Men    Its first issues were written by longstanding X Men writer Chris Claremont and drawn and co plotted by Jim Lee  Retailers pre ordered over 8 1 million copies of issue #1  generating and selling nearly $7 million  though retailers probably sold closer to 3 million copies    making it the best selling comic book of all time  according to Guinness Book of World Records  which presented honors to Claremont at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con   Another new X book released at the time was X Force  featuring the characters from The New Mutants  led by Cable  it was written by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza  Internal friction soon split the X books  creative teams  In a controversial move  X Men editor Bob Harras sided with Lee  and Uncanny X Men artist Whilce Portacio  over Claremont in a dispute over plotting  Claremont left after only three issues of X Men  ending his 16 year run as X Men writer  Marvel replaced Claremont briefly with John Byrne  who scripted both books for a few issues  Byrne was then replaced by Nicieza and Scott Lobdell  who would take over the majority of writing duties for the X Men until Lee s own departure months later when he and several other popular artists  including former X title artists Liefeld  Portacio  and Marc Silvestri  would leave Marvel to form Image Comics  Jim Lee s X Men designs would be the basis for much of the X Men animated series and action figure line as well as several Capcom video games   The 1990s saw an even greater number of X books with numerous ongoing series and miniseries running concurrently  X book crossovers continued to run annually  with  The X Tinction Agenda  in 1990   The Muir Island Saga  in 1991   X Cutioner s Song  in 1992   Fatal Attractions  in 1993   Phalanx Covenant  in 1994   Legion Quest   Age of Apocalypse  in 1995   Onslaught  in 1996  and  Operation  Zero Tolerance  in 1997  Though the frequent crossovers were criticized by fans as well as editorial and creative staff for being artificially regular  disruptive to the direction of the individual series  and having far less lasting impact than promised  they continued to be financially successful  There were many new popular additions to the X Men including Cable  Bishop  and Gambit—who became one of the most popular X Men  rivaling even Wolverine in size of fanbase   but many of the later additions to the team came and went  Joseph  Maggott  Marrow  Cecilia Reyes  and a new Thunderbird   Xavier s New Mutants grew up and became X Force  and the next generation of students began with Generation X  featuring Jubilee and other teenage mutants led and schooled by Banshee and former villainess Emma Frost at her Massachusetts Academy  In 1998  Excalibur and X Factor ended and the latter was replaced with Mutant X  starring Havok stranded in a parallel universe  Marvel launched a number of solo series  including Deadpool  Cable  Bishop  X Man  and Gambit  but few of the series would survive the decade   1 5  2000s  In 2000  Claremont returned to Marvel and was put back on the primary X Men titles during the Revolution event  He was later removed from the two flagship titles in 2001 and created his spin off series  X Treme X Men  X Men had its title changed to New X Men and writer Grant Morrison took over  The book is often referred to as the Morrison era  due to the drastic changes he made  beginning with  E Is For Extinction   where a new villain  Cassandra Nova  destroys Genosha  killing sixteen million mutants  Morrison also brought reformed ex villain Emma Frost into the primary X Men team  and opened the doors of the school by having Xavier  out  himself to the public about being a mutant  The bright spandex costumes that had become iconic over the previous decades were replaced by black leather street clothes reminiscent of the uniforms of the X Men films  Morrison also introduced Xorn  who would figure prominently in the climax of his run  Ultimate X Men set in Marvel s revised imprint was also launched  While Chuck Austen began his controversial run on Uncanny X Men   Several short lived spin offs and miniseries started featuring several X Men in solo series  such as Emma Frost  Gambit  Mystique  Nightcrawler  and Rogue  Another series  Exiles  started at the same time and concluded in December 2007 which led to New Exiles in January 2008 written by Claremont  Cable and Deadpool s books were merged into one book  Cable & Deadpool  Following Morrison s departure  a third core X Men title  Astonishing X Men was launched which was written by Joss Whedon  New X Men  Academy X was also launched focusing on the lives of the new young mutants at the Institute  This period included the resurrections of Colossus and Psylocke  a new death for Jean Grey  who later returned temporarily in the X Men  Phoenix   Endsong  as well as Emma Frost becoming the new headmistress of the Institute  The Institute formerly ran as a school  until the depowering of 98% of the mutant population served as a safe haven to mutants who are still powered   In 2007  the Messiah Complex crossover saw the destruction of the Xavier Institute and the disbanding of the X Men  It spun the new volumes of X Force  following the team led by Wolverine  and Cable  following Cable s attempts at protecting Hope Summers  X Men was renamed into X Men  Legacy which focused on Professor X  Rogue and Gambit  Under Cyclops  leadership  the X Men later reformed in Uncanny X Men #500  with their new base located in San Francisco  Uncanny X Men returned to its roots as the flagship title for the X Franchise and served as the umbrella under which the various X Books co exist  In 2009  Messiah War written by Craig Kyle and Chris Yost served as the second part in the trilogy that began with Messiah Complex was released  Utopia written by Matt Fraction  was a crossover of Dark Avengers and Uncanny X Men that served as a part of the Dark Reign storyline  A new New Mutants volume written by Zeb Wells  which featured the more prominent members of the original team reunited was launched  Magneto joined the X Men during the Nation X storyline to the dismay of other members of the X Men  such as Beast  who left the team  Magneto began to work with Namor to transform Utopia into a homeland for both mutants and Atlanteans  After the conclusion of Utopia  Rogue became the main character of X Men  Legacy   Notable additions to the X Men have been Emma Frost  Husk  Northstar  Armor  Pixie and Warpath  While former villains such as Juggernaut  Lady Mastermind  Mystique  and Sabretooth became members of the X Men  Other notable story arcs of this decade are  E Is For Extinction   2001    Planet X    Here Comes Tomorrow    Gifted   2004    House of M   2005   Deadly Genesis  2005–2006    Endangered Species   2007    Divided We Stand   2008    Manifest Destiny   2008–2009   X Infernus  and  Necrosha   2009   The X Men were also involved in the  Secret Invasion  storyline   1 6  2010s  In 2010   Second Coming  continued the plot threads on  Messiah Complex  and  House of M   while in 2012   Avengers vs  X Men  served as a closure to story lines such as  House of M  and  Decimation   It also ended with the death of Professor X and reappearance of new mutants  The aftermath of the  X Men  Schism   2011  led to the fallout between Wolverine and Cyclops  Featured in a new series titled Wolverine and the X Men  Wolverine rebuilt the original X Mansion and named it as Jean Grey School for Higher Learning   As part of the Marvel NOW  relaunch in 2012  many of the X Men titles were canceled and relaunched  including X Force  X Factor  X Men  Legacy  X Men  and Uncanny X Men  The relaunched Uncanny X Men features Cyclops  his team  and the new mutants  taking up residency in the Weapon X facility  which they have rebuilt into a school and named as the New Charles Xavier School for Mutants  New flagship titles such as Amazing X Men  Uncanny Avengers and All New X Men were launched  Uncanny Avengers featured a team of Avengers and X Men members while All New X Men featured the original five X Men members being brought to the present day  In 2013  for the 50th anniversary of the X Men franchise   Battle of the Atom  was published which involved members of both X Men schools try to decide what to do about the time displaced original X Men   Notable additions to the X Men have been X 23  Hope Summers  X Man and Blink  Other notable story arcs of this decade are  Curse of the Mutants   2010 2011    Age of X    Regenesis   2011  and  AXIS   2014    2  World of the X Men  The X Men exist in the Marvel Universe with other characters featured in Marvel Comics series  They often meet characters from other series  and the global nature of the mutant concept means the scale of stories can be highly varied  The X Men s enemies range from mutant thieves to galactic threats   Historically  the X Men have been based in the Xavier Institute  near Salem Center  in north east Westchester County  New York  and are often depicted as a family  The X Mansion is often depicted with three floors and two underground levels  To the outside world  it had acted as a higher learning institute until the 2000s  when Xavier was publicly exposed as a mutant at which point it became a full mutant boarding school  Xavier funds a corporation aimed at reaching mutants worldwide  though it ceased to exist following the  Decimation   The X Men benefit from advanced technology such as Xavier tracking down mutants with a device called Cerebro which amplifies his powers  the X Men train within the Danger Room  first depicted as a room full of weapons and booby traps  now as generating holographic simulations  and the X Men travel in their Blackbird jet   2 1  Fictional places  The X Men introduced several fictional locations which are regarded as important within the shared universe in which Marvel Comics characters exist   Asteroid M  an asteroid made by Magneto  a mutant utopia and training facility off of the Earth s surface   Genosha  an island near Madagascar and a longtime apartheid regime against mutants  Given control by the U N  to Magneto until the E Is for Extinction story   Madripoor  an island in South East Asia  near Singapore  Its location is shown to be in the southern portion of the Strait of Malacca  south west of Singapore   Muir Island  a remote island off the coast of Scotland  This is primarily known in the X Men universe as the home of Moira MacTaggert s laboratory   Mutant Town  also known as District X   an area in Alphabet City  Manhattan  populated largely by mutants and beset by poverty and crime   Savage Land  a preserved location in Antarctica which is home to a number of extinct species  most notably dinosaurs   Utopia  Cyclops had Asteroid M raised from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the San Francisco as a response to the rise of antimutant sentiment to form a mutant nation   3  Other versions  Age of Apocalypse – In a world where Professor Xavier is killed before he can form the X Men  Magneto leads the X Men in a dystopian world ruled by Apocalypse  Created and reverted via time travel   Days of Future Past – Sentinels have either killed or placed into concentration camps almost all mutants  Prevented by the time traveling Kate Pryde  the adult Kitty Pryde Shadowcat    House of M – Reality is altered by Scarlet Witch  with her father Magneto as the world s ruler  2005 s crossover event  it concludes with a reversion to the normal Marvel Universe  albeit with most mutants depowered   Marvel 1602 – Mutants are known as the  Witchbreed  in this alternate reality set during the time of The Inquisition  Carlos Javier creates a  school for the children of gentlefolk  to serve as a safe haven and training ground   Marvel 2099 – Set in a dystopian world with new characters looking to the original X Men

2005 status quo   4  Reflecting social issues  The conflict between mutants and normal humans is often compared to real world conflicts experienced by minority groups in America such as African Americans  Jews  various religious  or  non religious   groups  Communists  the LGBT community  etc  It has been remarked that attitudes towards mutants do not make sense in the context of the Marvel Universe  since non mutants with similar powers are rarely regarded with fear  X Men editor Ann Nocenti remarked that  I think that s literary  really   because there is no difference between Colossus and the Torch  If a guy comes into my office in flames  or a guy comes into my office and turns to steel  I m going to have the same reaction  It doesn t really matter that I know their origins        as a book  The X Men has always represented something different   their powers arrive at puberty  making them analogous to the changes you go through at adolescence   whether they re special  or out of control  or setting you apart   the misfit identity theme   Also on an individual level  a number of X Men serve a metaphorical function as their powers illustrate points about the nature of the outsider   Racism  Although this was not initially the case  Professor X has come to be compared to civil rights leader Martin Luther King  Jr  and Magneto to the more militant Malcolm X  The X Men’s purpose is sometimes referred to as achieving  Xavier’s dream   perhaps a reference to King’s historic  I Have a Dream  speech   Magneto  in the first film  quotes Malcolm X with the line  By any means necessary    X Men comic books have often portrayed mutants as victims of mob violence  evoking images of the lynching of African Americans in the age before the American civil rights movement  Sentinels and antimutant hate groups such as Friends of Humanity  Humanity s Last Stand  the Church of Humanity and Stryker s Purifiers are thought to often represent oppressive forces like the Ku Klux Klan giving a form to denial of civil rights and amendments  In the 1980s  the comic featured a plot involving the fictional island nation of Genosha  where mutants are segregated and enslaved by an apartheid state  This is widely interpreted as a reference to the situation in South Africa at the time   Anti Semitism  Explicitly referenced in recent decades is the comparison between antimutant sentiment and anti Semitism  Magneto  a Holocaust survivor  sees the situation of mutants as similar to those of Jews in Nazi Germany  At one point he even utters the words  never again  in a 1992 episode of the X Men animated series  The mutant slave labor camps on the island of Genosha  in which numbers were burned into mutant s foreheads  show much in common with Nazi concentration camps  as do the internment camps of the classic  Days of Future Past  storyline  In the third X Men film  when asked by Callisto   If you re so proud of being a mutant  then where s your mark   Magneto shows his concentration camp tattoo  while mentioning that he will never let another needle touch his skin  In the prequel film X Men  First Class  a fourteen year old Magneto suffers Nazi human experimentation during his time in the camps and witnesses his mother s death by gunshot   Diversity  Characters within the X Men mythos hail from a wide variety of nationalities  These characters also reflect religious  ethnic or sexual minorities  Examples include Shadowcat  Sabra and Magneto who are Jewish  Dust who is a devout Muslim  Nightcrawler who is a devout Catholic  and Neal Shaara Thunderbird who is Hindu  Storm represents two aspects of the African diaspora as her father was African American and her mother was Kenyan  Karma was portrayed as a devout Catholic from Vietnam  who regularly attended Mass and confession when she was introduced as a founding member of the New Mutants  This team also included Wolfsbane  a devout Scots Presbyterian   Danielle Moonstar  a Cheyenne Native American  and Cannonball  and was later joined by Magma  a devout Greco Roman classical religionist   Different nationalities included Wolverine  Aurora  Northstar  Deadpool and Transonic as Canadians  Colossus and Magik from Russia  Banshee and Siryn from Ireland  Gambit who is a Cajun  the original Thunderbird who was an Apache Native American  Psylocke  Wolfsbane and Chamber from the UK  Armor  Surge and Zero from Japan  Nightcrawler from Germany  Legion from Israel  Omega Sentinel  Neal Shaara  Kavita Rao and Indra from India  Velocidad from Mexico  Oya from Nigeria  Primal from Ukraine  etc   LGBT themes  Some commentators have noted the similarities between the struggles of mutants and the LGBT community  noting the onset of special powers around puberty and the parallels between being closeted and the mutants  concealment of their powers  In the comics series  gay and bisexual characters include Anole  Bling   Destiny  Karma  Mystique  Psylocke  Courier  Northstar  whose marriage was depicted in the comics in 2012   Graymalkin  Rictor  Shatterstar and the Ultimate version of Colossus  In the film X2  Bobby Drake s mother asks him   Have you ever tried not being a mutant   after revealing that he is a mutant  Transgender issues also come up with shapechangers like Mystique  Copycat  and Courier who can change gender at will  It has been said that the comic books and the X Men animated series delved into the AIDS epidemic with a long running plot line about the Legacy Virus  a seemingly incurable disease thought at first to attack only mutants  similar to the AIDS virus which at first was spread through the gay community    Red Scare  Occasionally  undercurrents of the  Red Scare  are present  Senator Robert Kelly s proposal of a Mutant Registration Act is similar to the efforts of United States Congress to try to ban Communism in the United States  In the 2000 X Men film  Kelly exclaims   We must know who these mutants are and what they can do   even brandishing a  list  of known mutants  a reference to Senator Joseph McCarthy s list of Communist Party USA members who were working in the government    Religion  Religion is an integral part of several X Men storylines  It is presented as both a positive and negative force  sometimes in the same story  The comics explore religious fundamentalism through the person of William Stryker and his Purifiers  an antimutant group that emerged in the 1982 graphic novel God Loves  Man Kills  The Purifiers believe that mutants are not human beings but children of the devil  and have attempted to exterminate them several times  most recently in the  Childhood s End  storyline  By contrast  religion is also central to the lives of several X Men  such as Nightcrawler  a devout Catholic  and Dust  a devout Sunni Muslim who wears an Islamic niqāb   Subculture  In some cases  the mutants of the X Men universe sought to create a subculture of the typical mutant society portrayed  The Morlocks  though mutants like those attending Xavier s school  hide away from society within the tunnels of New York  These Morlock tunnels serve as the backdrop for several X Men stories  most notably The Mutant Massacre crossover  This band of mutants illustrates another dimension to the comic  that of a group that further needs to isolate itself because society won t accept it  In Grant Morrison’s stories of the early 2000s  mutants are portrayed as a distinct subculture with  mutant bands   mutant use of code names as their primary form of self identity  rather than their given birth names   and a popular mutant fashion designer who created outfits tailored to mutant physiology  The series District X takes place in an area of New York City called  Mutant Town   These instances can also serve as analogies for the way that minority groups establish subcultures and neighborhoods of their own that distinguish them from the broader general culture  Director Bryan Singer has remarked that the X Men franchise has served as a metaphor for acceptance of all people for their special and unique gifts  The mutant condition that is often kept secret from the world can be analogous to feelings of difference and fear usually developed in everyone during adolescence   5  Cultural impact  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel s early 1960s comic books such as The Fantastic Four  The Amazing Spider Man  The Incredible Hulk  and X Men ushered in a new type of superhero  very different from the certain and all powerful superheroes before them  and changed the public s perception of superheroes   6  In other media  7  References  8  Further reading  Note  Contains a chapter on the X Men  with special emphasis on Jewish characters Magneto and Shadowcat   9  External links  at the
