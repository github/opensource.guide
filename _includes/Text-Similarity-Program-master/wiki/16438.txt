Janet is a private  UK government funded organisation  which provides computer network and related collaborative services to UK research and education  All further  and higher education organisations in the UK are connected to the Janet network  as are all the Research Councils  the majority of these sites are connected via 20 metropolitan area networks  though Janet refers to these as Regional Networks  emphasising that Janet connections are not just confined to a metropolitan area  across the UK  The network also carries traffic between schools within the UK  although many of the schools  networks maintain their own general Internet connectivity  The name was originally a contraction of Joint Academic NETwork but it is now known as Janet in its own right   The network is linked to other European and worldwide NRENs through GEANT and peers extensively with other ISPs at Internet Exchange Points in the UK  Any other networks are reached via transit services from commercial ISPs using Janet s Peering Policy   The Janet network is operated by Janet  Janet is also responsible for the  ac uk and  gov uk domains  It is funded by Jisc  On 1 December 2012  Janet and Jisc Collections joined together to form Jisc Collections and Janet Limited  as subsidiary organisations to Jisc  Janet continues to operate under the brand name of Janet  with the same remit of providing a world class network and related collaborative services to UK research and education  Janet was previously known as the JNT Association  and prior to that  UKERNA  the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association    1  History  Janet developed out of a number of local and research networks dating back to the 1970s  By 1980  a number of national computer facilities  ULCC London  UMRCC Manchester  Rutherford Appleton Laboratory serving the Science and Engineering Research Council community   each with their own star network had developed  There were also regional networks centred on Bristol  Edinburgh and Newcastle  where groups of institutions had pooled resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually  These networks were each based on one manufacturer s standards  were mutually incompatible  and overlapping  In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnect effort started  hosted on an expansion of the SERCnet X 25 research network  The system first went live in April 1983  hosting about 50 sites with line speeds of 9 6 kbit s  In the mid 80s the backbone was upgraded to a 2 Mbit s backbone with 64 kbit s access links  and a further upgrade in the early 1990s sped the backbone to 8 Mbit s and the access links to 2 Mbit s  making Janet the fastest X 25 network in the world   The Janet effort resulted in the standardisation known as the Coloured Book protocols  which provided the first complete X 25 standard  The naming scheme used on Janet  JANET NRS  had similarities to the Internet s Domain Name System  but with domains specified in big endian format rather than the little endian style used by DNS  There had been some talk of moving Janet to OSI protocols in the 1990s  but changes in the networking world meant this never happened   1 1  JIPS and SuperJanet  In January 1991 the Janet IP Service  JIPS  was set up as a pilot project to host IP traffic on the existing network  Within ten months the IP traffic had exceeded the levels of X 25 traffic  and the IP support became official in November  Today Janet is primarily a high speed IP network   In order to address speed concerns  several hardware upgrades have been incorporated into the Janet system  In 1989 SuperJanet was proposed  to re host Janet on a fibre optic network  Work started in late 1992  and by late 1993 the first 14 sites had migrated to the new 34 Mbit s ATM system  SuperJanet also moved solely to IP   In 1995 SuperJanet2 started  adding 155 Mbit s ATM backbones and a 10 Mbit s SMDS network encompassing some of the original Janet nodes  Janet s mandate now included running metropolitan area networks centred on these sites   SuperJanet3 created new 155 Mbit s ATM nodes to fully connect all of the major sites at London  Bristol  Manchester and Leeds  with 34 Mbit s links to smaller sites around the country   In March 2001 SuperJanet4 was launched  The key challenges for SuperJanet4 were the need to increase network capacity and to strengthen the design and management of the Janet network to allow it to meet a similar increase in the size of its userbase   SuperJanet4 saw the implementation of a 2 5 Gbit s core backbone from which connections to regional network points of presence were made at speeds ranging between 155 Mbit s to 2 5 Gbit s depending upon the size of the regional network  In 2002 the core SuperJanet4 backbone was upgraded to 10 Gbit s   SuperJanet4 also saw an increase in the userbase of the Janet network  with the inclusion of the Further Education Community and the use of the SuperJanet4 backbone to interconnect schools  networks  The core point of presence  Backbone  sites in SuperJanet4 were Edinburgh  Glasgow  Warrington  Reading  Bristol  Portsmouth  London and Leeds   In October 2006 the SuperJanet5 project was launched after £29 million of investment  It provides a 10Gbit s backbone  with an upgrade path to 40Gbit s over the next few years  The new backbone as a result of the SuperJanet5 project is a hybrid network offering  providing both a high speed IP transit service and private bandwidth channel services provisioned over a dedicated fibre network  It is designed not only to fully accommodate the requirements of the traditional Janet user base   all research institutes  universities and further education   but also to meet the needs of a new userbase in the UK s primary and secondary schools   In April 2011 Verizon helped Janet upgrade 4 central locations to run at 100Gbit s bringing it to a national research and education network performance parity with Internet2  which upgraded its backbone to 100Gbit s in October 2007   As of October 2011 they have over 18 million end users   Janet6 started to go live in July 2013  and was officially launched at an event at the London Film Museum on the 26 November 2013  At launch  Janet6 had an initial capacity of 2Tbit s   2  Regional networks  The Janet network is implemented through 19 regional networks which connect universities  colleges and schools to the Janet network  Most regional networks are operated by Janet  although a few operate as independent entities working under contract to Janet UK    Each regional network covers a specific geographical area  as of 2014 the following regional networks are connected to Janet   North East Scotland Region  Cumbria And North Lancashire Region  ClydeNET The Glasgow and Clydeside Network  EaStMAN The Edinburgh and Stirling Metropolitan Area Network  East of England Region  East Midlands Region  KPSN Kent Public Services
