Romare Bearden  September 2  1911 – March 12  1988  was an African American artist and writer  He worked in several media including cartoons  oils and collage  Born in Charlotte  North Carolina  Bearden moved to New York City at a very young age and went on to graduate from NYU in 1935  He began his artistic career creating scenes of the American South  Later  he endeavored to express the humanity he felt was lacking in the world after his experience in the US Army during World War II on the European front  He later returned to Paris in 1950 and studied Art History and Philosophy at the Sorbonne in 1950   Bearden s early work focused on unity and cooperation within the African American community  After a period during the 1950s when he painted more abstractly  this theme reemerged in his collage works of the 1960s  when Bearden became a founding member of the Harlem based art group known as The Spiral  formed to discuss the responsibility of the African American artist in the struggle for civil rights   Bearden was the author or coauthor of several books  and was a songwriter who co wrote the jazz classic  Sea Breeze   which was recorded by Billy Eckstine and Dizzy Gillespie  His lifelong support of young  emerging artists led him and his wife to create the Bearden Foundation to support young or emerging artists and scholars  In 1987  Bearden was awarded the National Medal of Arts  His work in collage led the New York Times to describe Bearden as “the nation s foremost collagist” in his 1988 obituary   1  Education  Bearden was born in Charlotte  North Carolina  His family moved him to New York City as a toddler  and their household soon became a meeting place for major figures of the Harlem Renaissance  His mother  Bessye Bearden  played an active role with New York City s Board of Education  and also served as founder and president of the Colored Women s Democratic League  Young Romare Bearden traveled frequently  to Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania and to visit family members in Charlotte  North Carolina   In 1929 he graduated from Peabody High School in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  He then enrolled in Lincoln University  the nation s first Historically Black College and University founded in 1854  He later transferred to Boston University where he served as art director for Beanpot  Boston University s student humor magazine  Bearden continued his studies at New York University  NYU   where he started to focus more on his art and less on athletics  and became a lead cartoonist and art editor for the Eucleian Society s  a secretive student society at NYU  monthly journal  The Medley  Bearden studied art  education  science and mathematics  graduating with a degree in science and education in 1935  He continued his artistic study under German artist George Grosz at the Art Students League in 1936 and 1937  During this period he supported himself as a political cartoonist for African American newspapers   2  Career as an artist  Bearden grew as an artist not by learning how to create new techniques and mediums  but by his life experiences  His early paintings were often of scenes in the American South  and his style was strongly influenced by the Mexican muralists  especially Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco  Shortly thereafter he began the first of his stints as a case worker for the New York Department of Social Services  During World War II  Bearden joined the United States Army  serving from 1942 until 1945  He would return to Europe in 1950 to study philosophy at the Sorbonne under the auspices of the GI Bill   This completely changed his style of art as he started producing abstract representations of what he deemed as human  specifically scenes from the Passion of the Christ  He had evolved from what Edward Alden Jewell  a reviewer for the New York Times  called a  debilitating focus on Regionalist and ethnic concerns  to what became known as his stylistic approach which participated in the post war aims of avant garde American art  His works were exhibited at the Samuel M  Kootz gallery until his work was deemed not abstract enough   During his success in the gallery  however  he produced Golgotha  a painting from his series of the Passion of the Christ  see Figure 1   Golgotha is an abstract representation of the Crucifixion  The eye of the viewer is drawn to the middle of the image first  where Bearden has rendered Christ s body  The body parts are stylized into abstract geometric shapes  yet still too realistic to be concretely abstract  this work has a feel of early Cubism  The body is in a central position and yet darkly contrasting with the highlighted crowds  The crowds of people are on the left and right  and are encapsulated within large spheres of bright colors of purple and indigo  The background of the painting is depicted in lighter jewel tones dissected with linear black ink  Bearden used these colors and contrasts because of the abstract influence of the time  but also for their meanings   Bearden intended to not focus on Christ but he wanted to emulate rather the emotions and actions of the crowds gathered around the Crucifixion  He worked hard to  depict myths in an attempt to convey universal human values and reactions   According to Bearden himself  Christ s life  death  and resurrection are the greatest expressions of man s humanism  not because of Christ s actual existence but the idea of him that lived on through other men  This is why Bearden focuses on Christ s body first  to portray the idea of the myth  and then highlights the crowd  to show how the idea is passed on to men   While it may seem as if Bearden was emphasizing the Biblical interpretations of Christ and the Crucifixion  he was actually focusing on the spiritual intent  He wanted to show ideas of humanism and thought that cannot be seen by the eye  but  must be digested by the mind   This is in accordance with the time he produced this image  as other famous artists creating avant garde abstract representations of historically significant events  such as Robert Motherwell’s commemoration of the Spanish Civil War  Jackson Pollock’s investigation of the Northwest Coast Indian art  Mark Rothko’s and Barnett Newman’s interpretations of Biblical stories  etc  Bearden used this form of art to depict humanity during a period of time when he didn’t see humanity in existence through the war  However  Bearden stands out from these other artists as his works  including Golgotha  are a little too realistic for this time  and he was kicked out of Sam Kootz s gallery   Bearden turned to music  co writing the hit song Sea Breeze  which was recorded by Billy Eckstine and Dizzy Gillespie  it is still considered a jazz classic  In 1954  at age 42  he married Nanette Bearden  a 27 year old dancer who herself became an artist and critic  The couple eventually created the Bearden Foundation to assist young artists   In the late 1950s  Bearden s work became more abstract  using layers of oil paint to produce muted  hidden effects  In 1956  Bearden began studying with a Chinese calligrapher  whom he credits with introducing him to new ideas about space and composition in painting  He also spent a lot of time studying famous European paintings he admired  particularly the work of the Dutch artists Johannes Vermeer  Pieter de Hooch  and Rembrandt  He began exhibiting again in 1960  About this time the couple established a second home in the Caribbean island of St  Maarten   In the early 1960s in Harlem  Bearden was a founding member of the art group known as The Spiral formed  for the purpose of discussing the commitment of the Negro artist in the present struggle for civil liberties  and as a discussion group to consider common aesthetic problems   The first meeting was held in Bearden s studio on July 5  1963 and was attended by Bearden  Hale Woodruff  Charles Alston  Norman Lewis  and James Yeargans  Felrath Hines  Richard Mayhew  and William Pritchard  Woodruff was responsible for naming the group The Spiral suggesting the way in which the Archimedes spiral ascends upward as a symbol of progress  Over time the group expanded to include Merton Simpson  Emma Amos  Reginald Gammon Alvin Hollingsworth  Calvin Douglas  Perry Ferguson  William Majors and Earle Miller  Stylistically the group ranged from Abstract Expressionists to social protest painters   3  Early works  His early works suggest the importance of African Americans  unity and cooperation  For instance  The Visitation implies the importance of collaboration of black communities by depicting intimacy between two black women who are holding hands together  However  not only because of the message conveyed  but also Bearden s vernacular realism represented in the work makes The Visitation noteworthy  Bearden describes two figures in The Visitation somewhat realistically but does not fully follow the pure realism by distorting and exaggerating some parts of their body  to “convey an experiential feeling or subjective disposition ” Bearden’s quotation also demonstrates his supportive view to vernacular realism  “the Negro artists  …  must not be content with merely recording a scene as a machine  He must enter wholeheartedly into the situation he wishes to convey ”  4  Collage  Bearden had struggled with two artistic sides of himself  his background as “a student of literature and of artistic traditions  and being a black human being involves very real experiences  figurative and concrete”  which was at combat with the mid twentieth century “exploration of abstraction”  His frustration with abstraction won over  as he himself described his paintings’ focus as coming to a plateau  Bearden then turned to a completely different medium at a very important time for the country   During the 1960s civil rights movement  Bearden started to experiment again  this time with forms of collage  After helping to found an artists group in support of civil rights  Bearden s work became more representational and more overtly socially conscious  He used clippings from magazines  which in and of itself was a new medium as glossy magazines were fairly new  He used these glossy scraps to incorporate modernity in his works  trying to show how not only were African American rights moving forward  but so was his socially conscious art  In 1964  he held an exhibition he called Projections  where he introduced his new collage style  These works were very well received  and these are generally considered to be his best work   There have been numerous museum shows of Bearden s work since then  including a 1971 show at the Museum of Modern Art entitled Prevalence of Ritual  an exhibition of his highly prized prints entitled A Graphic Odyssey showing the work of the last fifteen years of his life  and the 2005 National Gallery of Art retrospective entitled The Art of Romare Bearden  In 2011  Michael Rosenfeld Gallery exhibited its second show of the artist s work  Romare Bearden  1911–1988   Collage  A Centennial Celebration  an intimate grouping of 21 collages produced between 1964 and 1983   One of his most famous series  Prevalence of Ritual  concentrated mostly on southern African American life  He used these collages to show his rejection of the Harmon Foundation’s  a New York City arts organization  emphasis on the idea that African Americans must reproduce their culture in their art  Bearden found this to be a burden on African artists  because he saw this idea creating an emphasis on reproducing something that already exists in the world  He used this new series to speak out against this limitation on Black artists  and to emphasize modern art   In this series  one of the pieces is entitled Baptism  Bearden was influenced by Francisco de Zurbarán  and based Baptism on Zurbarán’s painting The Virgin Protectress of the Carthusians  Bearden wanted to show how the water that is about to be poured on the subject being baptized is always moving  giving the whole collage a feel and sense of temporal flux  This is a direct connection with the fact that African Americans’ rights were always changing  and society itself was in a temporal flux at the time he created this image  Bearden wanted to show how nothing is fixed  and represented this idea throughout the image  not only is the subject being baptized about to have water poured from the top  but the subject is also about to be submerged in water  Every aspect of the collage is moving and will never be the same more than once  which was congruent with society at the time   In  The Art of Romare Bearden   Ruth Fine describes his themes as  universal    A well read man whose friends were other artists  writers  poets and jazz musicians  Bearden mined their worlds as well as his own for topics to explore  He took his imagery from both the everyday rituals of African American rural life in the south and urban life in the north  melding those American experiences with his personal experiences and with the themes of classical literature  religion  myth  music and daily human ritual    A mural by Romare Bearden in the Gateway Center subway station in Pittsburgh is worth $15 million  more than the cash strapped transit agency expected  raising questions about how it should be cared for once it is removed before the station is demolished   We did not expect it to be that much   Port Authority of Allegheny County spokeswoman Judi McNeil said   We don t have the wherewithal to be a caretaker of such a valuable piece   It would cost the agency more than $100 000 a year to insure the 60 foot by 13 foot tile mural  McNeil said  Bearden was paid $90 000 for the project  titled  Pittsburgh Recollections   It was installed in 1984   Before his death  Bearden claimed the collage fragments aided him in ushering the past into the present   When I conjure these memories  they are of the present to me  because after all  the artist is a kind of enchanter in time    The Return of Odysseus  one of his collage works in the Art Institute of Chicago  exemplifies Bearden s effort to actively represent African American rights in a form of collage  This collage describes one of the scenes in Homer s novel Odyssey  in which the Odysseus is returning home from his long journey  When one first sees the collage  the focal point that first captures one s eyes is the main figure  Odysseus  situated at the middle of the work reaching his hand to his wife  However  if one takes a closer look at Odysseus  he or she would wonder why Odysseus and his wife  as well as all the other figures in the collage  are depicted as blacks  since according to the original story  Odysseus is a Greek king  This is one of the ways how Bearden actively involves in his collage works to represent African American rights  by replacing white characters into blacks  he attempts to defeat the rigidness of racial roles and stereotypes and open up the possibilities and potentials of blacks  In addition  the original novel depicts Odysseus as a strong character who has overcome numerous difficulties  and thus “Bearden may have seen Odysseus as a strong mental model for the African American community  which had endured its own adversities and setbacks ” Therefore  by describing Odysseus as black  Bearden maximizes the effect of potential black audiences empathizing to Odysseus   One may wonder why Bearden chose the technique of collage to support the Civil Rights Movement and assert African American rights  The reason he used this technique was because “he felt that art portraying the lives of African Americans did not give full value to the individual   …  In doing so he was able to combine abstract art with real images so that people of different cultures could grasp the subject matter of the African American culture  The people  This is why his theme always exemplified people of color ” In addition  collage’s technique of gathering several pieces together to create one assembled work “symbolizes the coming together of tradition and communities ”  5  Legacy  Romare Bearden died in New York City on March 12  1988 due to complications from bone cancer  In their obituary for him  the New York Times called Bearden  one of America s pre eminent artists  and  the nation s foremost collagist    Two years after his death  The Romare Bearden Foundation was founded  This non profit organization not only serves as Bearden s official Estate  but also helps  to preserve and perpetuate the legacy of this preeminent American artist   Recently  it has begun developing grant giving programs aimed at funding and supporting children  young  emerging  artists and scholars   In Charlotte  Romare Bearden has a street named after him  intersecting West Boulevard  on the west side of the city  On that site  Romare Bearden Drive is surrounded by the West Boulevard Public Library branch and rows of townhouses   Also in Charlotte at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Main Library  310 N  Tryon Street   just inside the doors is one of the strongest mosaic treasures in the region    Before Dawn   After Bearden s death  his widow selected a 12  x 18  collage to be recreated in smalti  glass tiles  by Crovatto Mosaics in Spilimbergo  Italy  for the Grand Reopening Gala  18 June 1989  of the  new  library  She was publicly honored at the ceremony for her contribution and graciously received much adulation from an appreciative city  The masterpiece is 9 feet tall and 13 5 feet wide   Ground breaking for Romare Bearden Park in Charlotte  took place at 9 am on September 2  2011  The park was created on a 5 2 acre parcel located in Third Ward between Church and Mint Streets and Martin Luther King Boulevard and 4th Street  At one point in his childhood  the artist lived near the new park at the corner of MLK Boulevard and Graham Street  The park design is based on work of public artist Norie Sato  Her concepts were inspired by Bearden s multimedia collages where he used memory  experience and tradition as the basis of his work   DC Moore Gallery currently represents the Estate of Romare Bearden  The first exhibition of his works at the gallery was in September 2008   6  Published works  Romare Bearden is the author of   Lil Dan  the
