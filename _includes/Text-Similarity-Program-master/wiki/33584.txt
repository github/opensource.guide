The World Meteorological Organization  WMO  is an intergovernmental organization with a membership of 191 Member States and Territories  It originated from the International Meteorological Organization  IMO   which was founded in 1873  Established in 1950  WMO became the specialised agency of the United Nations for meteorology  weather and climate   operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences  It has its headquarters in Geneva  Switzerland  and is a member of the United Nations Development Group  The current Secretary General is Michel Jarraud  The current president is David Grimes   1  The organization  The World Meteorological Organization  WMO  is a specialized agency of the United Nations  It is the UN system s authoritative voice on the state and behavior of the Earth s atmosphere  its interaction with the oceans  the climate it produces and the resulting distribution of water resources   WMO has a membership of 191 member states and territories  as of February 2014  The Convention of the World Meteorological Organization was signed 11 October 1947 and established upon ratification in 1950  WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations in 1951 for meteorology  weather and climate   operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences  It originated from the International Meteorological Organization  IMO   which was founded in 1873   The WMO hierarchy   The World Meteorological Congress determines the policy of WMO and meets every four years  Each Member country is represented by a Permanent Representative with WMO  The Permanent Representative should be the director of the National Meteorological or Hydrometeorological Service   The Executive Council  EC  implements Congress decisions and meets once a year   Six regional associations for addressing regional concerns  see the section on regional associations  below   Eight technical commissions provide technical recommendations for WMO and the national services   The secretariat headed by the Secretary General coordinates the activities of WMO with a regular staff of more than 250 employees   2  Activities  WMO provides a framework for international cooperation in the development of meteorology and operational hydrology and their practical application   Since its establishment  WMO has played a unique and powerful role in contributing to the safety and welfare of humanity  Under WMO leadership and within the framework of WMO programs  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services contribute substantially to the protection of life and property against natural disasters  to safeguarding the environment and to enhancing the economic and social well being of all sectors of society in areas such as food security  water resources and transport   The WMO and United Nations Environment Programme  UNEP  jointly created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC   It is also directly responsible for the creation of the Global Atmosphere Watch  GAW   The IPCC has received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007  for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change  and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change    WMO promotes cooperation in the establishment of networks for making meteorological  climatological  hydrological and geophysical observations  as well as the exchange  processing and standardization of related data  and assists technology transfer  training and research  It also fosters collaboration between the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of its Members and furthers the application of meteorology to public weather services  agriculture  aviation  shipping  the environment  water issues and the mitigation of the impacts of natural disasters   WMO facilitates the free and unrestricted exchange of data and information  products and services in real  or near real time on matters relating to safety and security of society  economic welfare and the protection of the environment  It contributes to policy formulation in these areas at national and international levels   In the specific case of weather   climate and water related hazards  which account for nearly 90% of all natural disasters  WMO s programs provide vital information for the advance warnings that save lives and reduce damage to property and the environment  WMO also contributes to reducing the impacts of human induced disasters  such as those associated with chemical and nuclear accidents  forest fire and volcanic ash  Studies have shown that  apart from the incalculable benefit to human well being  every dollar invested in meteorological and hydrological services produces an economic return many times greater  often ten times or more   WMO plays a leading role in international efforts to monitor and protect the environment through its programs  In collaboration with other UN agencies and the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services  WMO supports the implementation of a number of environmental conventions and is instrumental in providing advice and assessments to governments on related matters  These activities contribute towards ensuring the sustainable development and well being of nations   WMO publishes the International Cloud Atlas  the international standard cloud atlas since 1896   2 1  Meteorological codes  In keeping with its mandate to promote the standardization of meteorological observations  the WMO maintains numerous code forms for the representation and exchange of meteorological  oceanographical  and hydrological data  The traditional code forms  such as SYNOP  CLIMAT and TEMP  are character based and their coding is position based  Newer WMO code forms are designed for portability  extensibility and universality  These are BUFR  CREX  and  for gridded geo positioned data  GRIB   3  World Meteorological Day  World Meteorological Day is held annually on 23 March   4  Awards and prizes  International Meteorological Organization Prize  Vilho Väisälä Award  Norbert Gerbier Mumm International Award  WMO Research Award for Young Scientists  Professor

under the auspices of WMO  Its goal was to address advancements in seasonal to multi decadal climate predictions and to spur their applications to decision making in socio economic sectors  including food  water  energy  health  tourism and development sectors  The Conference aimed to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and broader UN climate goals through support for climate adaptation   6  Membership  As of February 2014  member states of the organisation include 183 of the 193 UN members  the Cook Islands and Niue  for a total of 185 member

inhabitants  Non members of either organisation include the Vatican City and the states with limited recognition   The six member territories are  the British Caribbean Territories  joint

members with admission dates   6 1  Current member states  States that joined the WMO before they joined the UN are marked with a blue background  States that are members of the WMO  but not of the UN are marked with a green background  For comparison  see Member states of the United Nations  The dates are the dates of the ratification of the WMO Convention by the member  or the date of accession  The national meteorological services belonging to each member state are also listed   6 2  Historical member states  6 3  Member territories  6 4  Membership by regional associations  The member states of the WMO are divided into six regional associations  The division is as follows   The sum of member states in the regional associations is larger than the total number of member states because some nations are members to more than one regional association   6 4 1  Region I  Africa   Region I consists of the nations of Africa and a few former colonial powers  and has 57 member states and no member territories  these are   Not member  6 4 2  Region II  Asia   Region II consists of nations in Asia  having a total of 33 member states and 2 member territories  The member states are
