name Odense is derived from Odins Vé  meaning  Odin s sanctuary  as the area was known as a sanctuary for worshippers of the Nordic god  Odin   Odense is one of Denmark s oldest cities  Archaeological excavations in the vicinity show proof of settlement for over 4 000 years since at least the Stone Age  The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake  now dry  to the north  Nonnebakken  one of Denmark s former Viking ring fortresses  lay to the south of the river  Today  Odense s Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area  The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast   The city celebrated its thousandth anniversary in 1988  commemorating the first mention of the town s name in a letter dated 18 March 988 from the German Emperor Otto III which granted rights to Odense and neighbouring settlements  The first church in Odense appears to have been St Mary s  probably built in the late 12th century  The first bishop of Odense was Reginbert who was consecrated by Æthelnoth  archbishop of Canterbury  in 1022   Recent excavations have shown that from the early 11th century  the town developed in the area around Albani Torv  Fisketorvet  Overgade and Vestergade  By 1070  Odense had already grown into a city of stature in Denmark  Canute IV of Denmark  generally considered to be the last Viking king  was murdered by unruly peasants  discontent with the high taxes he imposed on the town  in Odense s St Alban s Priory on 10 July 1086  He was canonized in 1100  The priory no longer exists  although a church has been situated on the site since about 900  At the beginning of the 12th century  Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute s Abbey  It was here the English monk Ælnoth wrote Denmark s first literary work  Vita et Passio S  Canuti  The Life and Passion of St Canute   Canute s shrine in Odense Cathedral  which was attached to the priory  attracted pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages   1 2  Middle Ages  In the Middle Ages  a number of churches and monasteries were built in the town  St Canute s Church  Skt  Knuds Kirke   now the cathedral  dates from the end of the 13th century and was closely connected to the Benedictine Order  The town s other old churches are St Mary s  Vor Frue Kirke  and St John s  Skt  Hans Kirke  with its adjacent monastery  Greyfriars Monastery  Gråbrødre Kloster  was founded by the Franciscans in 1279   In 1247 Odense was burned by Abel of Denmark during conflicts with his brother King Erik IV  The cathedral had to be completely rebuilt  Nevertheless  the town continued to flourish as a commercial centre  and was charted in 1335  The city thrived economically during the Middle Ages  attracting many merchants and craftsman who traded their goods   In 1482 Bishop Karl Rønnov brought the German printer Johann Snell to Odense to print a short prayer book  Breviarium Ottoniense  considered to be the first work to be printed in Scandinavia  In parallel Snell printed De obsidione et bello Rhodiano  an account of the Turkish siege of the island of Rhodes   After the Danish Reformation the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid 17th century  becoming northern Funen s commercial centre  One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle  providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half timbered houses for the local merchants  The local nobility also participated in the city s development by building residences where they spent the winter months  But the city s prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed after the end of the Swedish Wars  A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century   From the 16th century the town was the meeting place of several parliaments  and until 1805 Odense was the seat of the provincial assembly of Funen  By 1700 Odense s population was about 4 000   1 3  Development  Dramatic changes began in Odense in the 18th century to modernise the city and a great plan was drawn up for development  In 1720  Frederick IV ordered the rebuilding of Odense Palace  partly on the foundations of the 13th century St  Hans’s Monastery  and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the Knights Hospitallers  An 8 kilometre  5 0 mi  long  7 5 metre  25 ft  deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense Fjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city  radically increasing its level of trade and population  Founded in 1796  Odense Teater is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country s second oldest  Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995  The Odense Music Library contains Denmark s largest collection of phonograms   From the 1840s  the city enjoyed a period of rapid expansion beyond its traditional boundaries  becoming Denmark s second largest city  The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river  Glove production  which had begun in the 18th century  developed into one of the most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded  In 1853 Denmark s first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense  Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865  and Odense became one of Denmark s largest rail junctions  All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation  attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals  textiles  and food and beverages  Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion  and the population of the city began to grow markedly  by 1900 it had 35 000 inhabitants   1 4  Modern history  Odense s most famous landmark was Odinstårnet  The Odin Tower

However  a miniature model now stands in Odinsparken in the area where the original was located  During the German occupation in the Second World War  Odense s general strike in August 1943 contributed to terminating collaboration with the Germans   Until the beginning of the Danish industrial revolution  Odense was also the second largest city in modern Denmark  but has in recent times been overtaken by Aarhus  From the 1960s Odense increasingly became a cultural hub  with the establishment of a university in 1966 and the launching of trade shows  including the large Odense Congress Centre  In 1988 a major national television network  TV2  was established in Odense   In celebration of the thousandth anniversary in 1988  a forest  Tusindårsskoven  meaning  The Thousand Year Forest
