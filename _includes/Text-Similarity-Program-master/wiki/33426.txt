Wave–particle duality is the concept that every elementary particle or quantic entity exhibits the properties of not only particles  but also waves  It addresses the inability of the classical concepts  particle  or  wave  to fully describe the behavior of quantum scale objects  As Einstein wrote   It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other  while at times we may use either  We are faced with a new kind of difficulty  We have two contradictory pictures of reality  separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light  but together they do    Various opinions have arisen about this   Initiated by Louis de Broglie  before the discovery of quantum mechanics  and developed later as the de Broglie Bohm theory  the pilot wave interpretation does not regard the duality as paradoxical  seeing both particle and wave aspects as always coexisting  According to Schrödinger  the domain of the de Broglie waves is ordinary physical space time  This formal feature in principle makes an account separable in ordinary physical space time  It thereby serves to exhibit this particular theory as non local  which is considered by many physicists to be a grave defect in a theory   Still in the days of the old quantum theory  another pre quantum mechanical version of wave–particle duality was pioneered by William Duane  and developed by others including Alfred Landé  Duane explained diffraction of x rays by a crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect  The deflection of the trajectory of each diffracted photon was due to quantal translative momentum transfer from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal  Fourier analysis reveals the wave–particle duality as a simply mathematical equivalence  always present  and universal for all quanta  The same reasoning applies for example to diffraction of electrons by a crystal   In the light of de Broglie s ideas  Erwin Schrödinger developed his wave mechanics by referring the universal wave aspect not to ordinary physical space time  but rather to a profoundly different and more abstract  space   The domain of Schrödinger s wave function is configuration space  Ordinary physical space time allows more or less direct visualization of cause and effect relations  and so is said to be separable  In that sense  configuration space is not separable  and does not directly show cause and effect linkages  Sometimes  nevertheless  it seemed as if Schrödinger visualized his own waves as referring to ordinary space time  and there was much debate about this   Niels Bohr regarded the  duality paradox  as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of nature  Sometimes the wave aspect was apparent  and sometimes the particle aspect  with the same kind of quantic entity  but in respectively different physical settings  He saw it as one aspect of the concept of complementarity  Bohr regarded renunciation of the cause effect relation  or complementarily  of the space time picture  as essential to the quantum mechanical account   Werner Heisenberg considered the question further  He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities  but not quite in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr  He saw it in what is called second quantization  which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space time  causality still being visualizable  Classical field values  e g  the electric and magnetic field strengths of Maxwell  are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value  as considered in quantum field theory  Turning the reasoning around  ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory   Because of the difference of views of Bohr and Heisenberg  the main sources of the so called Copenhagen interpretation  the position of that interpretation on wave–particle duality is ill defined   1  Origin of theory  The idea of duality originated in a debate over the nature of light and matter that dates back to the 17th century  when Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton proposed competing theories of light  light was thought either to consist of waves  Huygens  or of particles  Newton   Through the work of Max Planck  Albert Einstein  Louis de Broglie  Arthur Compton  Niels Bohr  and many others  current scientific theory holds that all particles also have a wave nature  and vice versa   This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles  but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules  For macroscopic particles  because of their extremely short wavelengths  wave properties usually cannot be detected   2  Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints  Aristotle was one of the first to publicly hypothesize about the nature of light  proposing that light is a disturbance in the element air  that is  it is a wave like phenomenon   On the other hand  Democritus—the original atomist—argued that all things in the universe  including light  are composed of indivisible sub components  light being some form of solar atom   At the beginning of the 11th Century  the Arabic scientist Alhazen wrote the first comprehensive treatise on optics  describing refraction  reflection  and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye  He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light  In 1630  René Descartes popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light  showing that the behavior of light could be re created by modeling wave like disturbances in a universal medium   plenum    Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades  Isaac Newton developed and championed his corpuscular hypothesis  arguing that the perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light s particle nature  only particles could travel in such straight lines  He explained refraction by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium  Around the same time  Newton s contemporaries Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens—and later Augustin Jean Fresnel—mathematically refined the wave viewpoint  showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media  such as water and air   refraction could be easily explained as the medium dependent propagation of light waves  The resulting Huygens–Fresnel principle was extremely successful at reproducing light s behavior and  subsequently supported by Thomas Young s 1803 discovery of double slit interference  was the beginning of the end for the particle light camp   The final blow against corpuscular theory came when James Clerk Maxwell discovered that he could combine four simple equations  which had been previously discovered  along with a slight modification to describe self propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields  When the propagation speed of these electromagnetic waves was calculated  the speed of light fell out  It quickly became apparent that visible light  ultraviolet light  and infrared light  phenomena thought previously to be unrelated  were all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency  The wave theory had prevailed—or at least it seemed to   While the 19th century had seen the success of the wave theory at describing light  it had also witnessed the rise of the atomic theory at describing matter  In 1789  Antoine Lavoisier securely differentiated chemistry from alchemy by introducing rigor and precision into his laboratory techniques  allowing him to deduce the conservation of mass and categorize many new chemical elements and compounds  However  the nature of these essential chemical elements remained unknown  In 1799  Joseph Louis Proust advanced chemistry towards the atom by showing that elements combined in definite proportions  This led John Dalton to resurrect Democritus  atom in 1803  when he proposed that elements were invisible sub components  which explained why the varying oxides of metals  e g  stannous oxide and cassiterite  SnO and SnO2 respectively  possess a 1 2 ratio of oxygen to one another  But Dalton and other chemists of the time had not considered that some elements occur in monatomic form  like Helium  and others in diatomic form  like Hydrogen   or that water was H2O  not the simpler and more intuitive HO—thus the atomic weights presented at the time were varied and often incorrect  Additionally  the formation of H2O by two parts of hydrogen gas and one part of oxygen gas would require an atom of oxygen to split in half  or two half atoms of hydrogen to come together   This problem was solved by Amedeo Avogadro  who studied the reacting volumes of gases as they formed liquids and solids  By postulating that equal volumes of elemental gas contain an equal number of atoms  he was able to show that H2O was formed from two parts H2 and one part O2  By discovering diatomic gases  Avogadro completed the basic atomic theory  allowing the correct molecular formulae of most known compounds—as well as the correct weights of atoms—to be deduced and categorized in a consistent manner  The final stroke in classical atomic theory came when Dimitri Mendeleev saw an order in recurring chemical properties  and created a table presenting the elements in unprecedented order and symmetry  But there were holes in Mendeleev s table  with no element to fill them in  His critics initially cited this as a fatal flaw  but were silenced when new elements were discovered that perfectly fit into these holes  The success of the periodic table effectively converted any remaining opposition to atomic theory  even though no single atom had ever been observed in the laboratory  chemistry was now an atomic science   3  Turn of the 20th century and the paradigm shift  3 1  Particles of electricity  At the close of the 19th century  the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the atom itself  determining  through physics  the nature of the atom and the operation of chemical reactions  Electricity  first thought to be a fluid  was now understood to consist of particles called electrons  This was first demonstrated by J  J  Thomson in 1897 when  using a cathode ray tube  he found that an electrical charge would travel across a vacuum  which would possess infinite resistance in classical theory   Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel  this discovery could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum  This electron flew in the face of classical electrodynamics  which had successfully treated electricity as a fluid for many years  leading to the invention of batteries  electric motors  dynamos  and arc lamps   More importantly  the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell  Since electromagnetism was known to be a wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic field  a continuous  wave like entity itself  an atomic particle description of electricity and charge was a non sequitur  Furthermore  classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete   3 2  Radiation quantization  Black body radiation  the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object s heat  could not be explained from classical arguments alone  The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics  the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories  stated that an object s energy is partitioned equally among the object s vibrational modes  This worked well when describing thermal objects  whose vibrational modes were defined as the speeds of their constituent atoms  and the speed distribution derived from egalitarian partitioning of these vibrational modes closely matched experimental results  Speeds much higher than the average speed were suppressed by the fact that kinetic energy is quadratic—doubling the speed requires four times the energy—thus the number of atoms occupying high energy modes  high speeds  quickly drops off because the constant  equal partition can excite successively fewer atoms  Low speed modes would ostensibly dominate the distribution  since low speed modes would require ever less energy  and prima facie a zero speed mode would require zero energy and its energy partition would contain an infinite number of atoms  But this would only occur in the absence of atomic interaction  when collisions are allowed  the low speed modes are immediately suppressed by jostling from the higher energy atoms  exciting them to higher energy modes  An equilibrium is swiftly reached where most atoms occupy a speed proportional to the temperature of the object  thus defining temperature as the average kinetic energy of the object    But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful  It had been long known that thermal objects emit light  Hot metal glows red  and upon further heating  white  this is the underlying principle of the incandescent bulb   Since light was known to be waves of electromagnetism  physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws  This became known as the black body problem  Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself  it was trivial to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects  But a problem quickly arose when determining the vibrational modes of light  To simplify the problem  by limiting the vibrational modes  a longest allowable wavelength was defined by placing the thermal object in a cavity  Any electromagnetic mode at equilibrium  i e  any standing wave  could only exist if it used the walls of the cavities as nodes  Thus there were no waves modes with a wavelength larger than twice the length  L  of the cavity   The first few allowable modes would therefore have wavelengths of   2L  L  2L 3  L 2  etc   each successive wavelength adding one node to the wave   However  while the wavelength could never exceed 2L  there was no such limit on decreasing the wavelength  and adding nodes to reduce the wavelength could proceed ad infinitum  Suddenly it became apparent that the short wavelength modes completely dominated the distribution  since ever shorter wavelength modes could be crammed into the cavity  If each mode received an equal partition of energy  the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy  This became clear when plotting the Rayleigh–Jeans law which  while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions  predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths  This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe   The solution arrived in 1900 when Max Planck hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on the frequency of the oscillator that emitted it  and the energy of these oscillators increased linearly with frequency  according to his constant h  where E   hν   This was not an unsound proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly  when studying five simple harmonic oscillators of equal amplitude but different frequency  the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest energy  though this relationship is not linear like Planck s   By demanding that high frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency  and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency  Planck avoided any catastrophe  giving an equal partition to high frequency oscillators produced successively fewer oscillators and less emitted light  And as in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution  the low frequency  low energy oscillators were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy oscillators  which necessarily increased their energy and frequency   The most revolutionary aspect of Planck s treatment of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field  These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field  creating a quantum of light  as often as they are excited by the electromagnetic field  absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency  Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body  but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light  where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν  However  once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field  he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation  not a property of reality   3 3  Photoelectric effect illuminated  Yet while Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field  most physicists immediately agreed that Planck s  light quanta  were unavoidable flaws in his model  A more complete derivation of black body radiation would produce a fully continuous  fully wave like electromagnetic field with no quantization  However  in 1905 Albert Einstein took Planck s black body model in itself and saw a wonderful solution to another outstanding problem of the day  the photoelectric effect  the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light  Ever since the discovery of electrons eight years previously  electrons had been the thing to study in physics laboratories worldwide   In 1902 Philipp Lenard discovered that  within the range of the experimental parameters he was using  the energy of these ejected electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incoming light  but on its frequency  So if one shines a little low frequency light upon a metal  a few low energy electrons are ejected  If one now shines a very intense beam of low frequency light upon the same metal  a whole slew of electrons are ejected  however they possess the same low energy  there are merely more of them  In order to get high energy electrons  one must illuminate the metal with high frequency light  The more light there is  the more electrons are ejected  Like blackbody radiation  this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and matter  However  it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light  as long as matter is quantum mechanical in nature   If one used Planck s energy quanta  and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum hν  then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply  Low frequency light only ejects low energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon  Increasing the intensity of the low frequency light  increasing the number of photons  only increases the number of excited electrons  not their energy  because the energy of each photon remains low  Only by increasing the frequency of the light  and thus increasing the energy of the photons  can one eject electrons with higher energy  Thus  using Planck s constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency  the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency  the gradient of the line being Planck s constant  These results were not confirmed until 1915  when Robert Andrews Millikan  who had previously determined the charge of the electron  produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein s predictions  While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck s constant  the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect  of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate level labs  This phenomenon could only be explained via photons  and not through any semi classical theory  which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect   When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921  it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity  but for the simple  yet totally revolutionary  suggestion of quantized light  Einstein s  light quanta  would not be called photons until 1925  but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave particle duality  Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations  but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements  thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously   4  Developmental milestones  4 1  Huygens and Newton  The earliest comprehensive theory of light was advanced by Christiaan Huygens  who proposed a wave theory of light  and in particular demonstrated how waves might interfere to form a wavefront  propagating in a straight line  However  the theory had difficulties in other matters  and was soon overshadowed by Isaac Newton s corpuscular theory of light  That is  Newton proposed that light consisted of small particles  with which he could easily explain the phenomenon of reflection  With considerably more difficulty  he could also explain refraction through a lens  and the splitting of sunlight into a rainbow by a prism  Newton s particle viewpoint went essentially unchallenged for over a century   4 2  Young  Fresnel  and Maxwell  In the early 19th century  the double slit experiments by Young and Fresnel provided evidence for Huygens  wave theories  The double slit experiments showed that when light is sent through a grid  a characteristic interference pattern is observed  very similar to the pattern resulting from the interference of water waves  the wavelength of light can be computed from such patterns  The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view  but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century  since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not   In the late 19th century  James Clerk Maxwell explained light as the propagation of electromagnetic waves according to the Maxwell equations  These equations were verified by experiment by Heinrich Hertz in 1887  and the wave theory became widely accepted   4 3  Planck s formula for black body radiation  In 1901  Max Planck published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object  To accomplish this  Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the oscillators  atoms of the black body  that emit radiation  It was Einstein who later proposed that it is the electromagnetic radiation itself that is quantized  and not the energy of radiating atoms   4 4  Einstein s explanation of the photoelectric effect  In 1905  Albert Einstein provided an explanation of the photoelectric effect  a hitherto troubling experiment that the wave theory of light seemed incapable of explaining  He did so by postulating the existence of photons  quanta of light energy with particulate qualities   In the photoelectric effect  it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an electric current in a circuit  Presumably  the light was knocking electrons out of the metal  causing current to flow  However  using the case of potassium as an example  it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current  even the strongest  brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all  According to the classical theory of light and matter  the strength or amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness  a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current  Yet  oddly  this was not so   Einstein explained this conundrum by postulating that the electrons can receive energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete portions  quanta that were called photons   an amount of energy E that was related to the frequency f of the light by  where h is Planck s constant  6 626 × 10−34 J seconds   Only photons of a high enough frequency  above a certain threshold value  could knock an electron free  For example  photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal  but photons of red light did not  More intense light above the threshold frequency could release more electrons  but no amount of light  using technology available at the time  below the threshold frequency could release an electron  To  violate  this law would require extremely high intensity lasers which had not yet been invented  Intensity dependent phenomena have now been studied in detail with such lasers   Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect   4 5  De Broglie s wavelength  In 1924  Louis Victor de Broglie formulated the de Broglie hypothesis  claiming that all matter  not just light  has a wave like nature  he related wavelength  denoted as λ   and momentum  denoted as p    This is a generalization of Einstein s equation above  since the momentum of a photon is given by p   and the wavelength  in a vacuum  by λ     where c is the speed of light in vacuum   De Broglie s formula was confirmed three years later for electrons  which differ from photons in having a rest mass  with the observation of electron diffraction in two independent experiments  At the University of Aberdeen  George Paget Thomson passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns  At Bell Labs Clinton Joseph Davisson and Lester Halbert Germer guided their beam through a crystalline grid   De Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for his hypothesis  Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their experimental work   4 6  Heisenberg s uncertainty principle  In his work on formulating quantum mechanics  Werner Heisenberg postulated his uncertainty principle  which states   where  Heisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of measuring  Measuring position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa  offering an example  the  gamma ray microscope   that depended crucially on the de Broglie hypothesis  It is now thought  however  that this only partly explains the phenomenon  but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle itself  even before the measurement is made   In fact  the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle  extending the Copenhagen interpretation first put forward by Bohr and Heisenberg  depends even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle  Just as it is nonsensical to discuss the precise location of a wave on a string  particles do not have perfectly precise positions  likewise  just as it is nonsensical to discuss the wavelength of a  pulse  wave traveling down a string  particles do not have perfectly precise momenta  which corresponds to the inverse of wavelength   Moreover  when position is relatively well defined  the wave is pulse like and has a very ill defined wavelength  and thus momentum   And conversely  when momentum  and thus wavelength  is relatively well defined  the wave looks long and sinusoidal  and therefore it has a very ill defined position   4 7  de Broglie–Bohm theory  De Broglie himself had proposed a pilot wave construct to explain the observed wave particle duality  In this view  each particle has a well defined position and momentum  but is guided by a wave function derived from Schrödinger s equation  The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated non local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle  Non locality  however  soon became established as an integral feature of quantum theory  see EPR paradox   and David Bohm extended de Broglie s model to explicitly include it   In the resulting representation  also called the de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics  the wave particle duality vanishes  and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance  because the particle s motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential   This idea seems to me so natural and simple  to resolve the wave particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way  that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored   J S Bell   The best illustration of the pilot wave model was given by Couder s 2010  walking droplets  experiments  demonstrating the pilot wave behaviour in a macroscopic mechanical analog   5  Wave behavior of large objects  Since the demonstrations of wave like properties in photons and electrons  similar experiments have been conducted with neutrons and protons  Among the most famous experiments are those of Estermann and Otto Stern in 1929  Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules  described below  claim that these larger particles also act like waves   A dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of gravity in relation to wave–particle duality were conducted in the 1970s using the neutron interferometer  Neutrons  one of the components of the atomic nucleus  provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter  In the neutron interferometer  they act as quantum mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity  While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything  including light  see tests of general relativity and the Pound–Rebka falling photon experiment   the self interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before   In 1999  the diffraction of C60 fullerenes by researchers from the University of Vienna was reported  Fullerenes are comparatively large and massive objects  having an atomic mass of about 720 u  The de Broglie wavelength is 2 5 pm  whereas the diameter of the molecule is about 1 nm  about 400 times larger  In 2012  these far field diffraction experiments could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives  which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively  In these experiments the build up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity   In 2003  the Vienna group also demonstrated the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrin—a flat biodye with an extension of about 2 nm and a mass of 614 u  For this demonstration they employed a near field Talbot Lau interferometer  In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48   a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u  composed of 108 atoms  Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to some aspects of the quantum classical interface  i e   to certain decoherence mechanisms  In 2011  the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910 u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer  These are the largest objects that so far showed de Broglie matter wave interference  In 2013  the interference of molecules beyond 10 000 u has been demonstrated   Whether objects heavier than the Planck mass  about the weight of a large bacterium  have a de Broglie wavelength is theoretically unclear and experimentally unreachable  above the Planck mass a particle s Compton wavelength would be smaller than the Planck length and its own Schwarzschild radius  a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to be replaced by more general ones   Recently Couder  Fort  et al  showed that we can use macroscopic oil droplets on a vibrating surface as a model of wave–particle duality—localized droplet creates periodical waves around and interaction with them leads to quantum like phenomena  interference in double slit experiment  unpredictable tunneling  depending in complicated way on practically hidden state of field   orbit quantization  that particle has to  find a resonance  with field perturbations it creates—after one orbit  its internal phase has to return to the initial state  and Zeeman effect   6  Treatment in modern quantum mechanics  Wave–particle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of quantum mechanics  In the formalism of the theory  all the information about a particle is encoded in its wave function  a complex valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space  This function evolves according to a differential equation  generically called the Schrödinger equation   For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the form of the wave equation  Propagation of such waves leads to wave like phenomena such as interference and diffraction  Particles without mass  like photons  has no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave   The particle like behavior is most evident due to phenomena associated with measurement in quantum mechanics  Upon measuring the location of the particle  the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the uncertainty principle  When viewed through this formalism  the measurement of the wave function will randomly  collapse   or rather  decohere   to a sharply peaked function at some location  For particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared amplitude of the wave function there  The measurement will return a well defined position   subject to uncertainty   a property traditionally associated with particles  It is important to note that a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and the measured quantity is forced into a particular eigenstate  The act of measurement is therefore not fundamentally different from any other interaction   Following the development of quantum field theory the ambiguity disappeared  The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation  which are referred to as the wave functions  The term particle is used to label the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group that are permitted by the field  An interaction as in a Feynman diagram is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the field interaction  Since the field is non local and quantized  the phenomena which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained  Within the limits of the wave particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results   6 1  Visualization  There are two ways to visualize the wave particle behaviour  by the  standard model   described below  and by the Broglie–Bohm model  where no duality is perceived   Below is an illustration of wave–particle duality as it relates to De Broglie s hypothesis and Heisenberg s uncertainty principle  above   in terms of the position and momentum space wavefunctions for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension  These wavefunctions are Fourier transforms of each other   The more localized the position space wavefunction  the more likely the particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region  and correspondingly the momentum space wavefunction is less localized so the possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread   Conversely the more localized the momentum space wavefunction  the more likely the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that region  and correspondingly the less localized the position space wavefunction  so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread   7  Alternative views  Wave–particle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics  Most physicists accept wave particle duality as the best explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena  however  it is not without controversy  Alternative views are also presented here  These views are not generally accepted by mainstream physics  but serve as a basis for valuable discussion within the community   7 1  Both particle and wave view  The pilot wave model  originally developed by Louis de Broglie and further developed by David Bohm into the hidden variable theory proposes that there is no duality  but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties simultaneously  and particles are guided  in a deterministic fashion  by the pilot wave  or its  quantum potential   which will direct them to areas of constructive interference in preference to areas of destructive interference  This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics community   At least one physicist considers the  wave duality  as not being an incomprehensible mystery  L E  Ballentine  Quantum Mechanics  A Modern Development  p  4  explains   When first discovered  particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement  Are  particles  really  waves   In the early experiments  the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate  which could not detect individual particles  As a result  the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible  or complementary  in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them  That idea  however  was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation  Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons  and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots  Tonomura et al   1989   Evidently  quantum particles are indeed particles  but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect  It has been claimed that the Afshar experiment  2007  shows that it is possible to simultaneously observe both wave and particle properties of photons  This claim is  however  rejected by other scientists   7 2  Wave only view  At least one scientist proposes that the duality can be replaced by a  wave only  view  In his book Collective Electrodynamics  Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism  2000   Carver Mead purports to analyze the behavior of electrons and photons purely in terms of electron wave functions  and attributes the apparent particle like behavior to quantization effects and eigenstates  According to reviewer David Haddon   Mead has cut the Gordian knot of quantum complementarity  He claims that atoms  with their neutrons  protons  and electrons  are not particles at all but pure waves of matter  Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena  including the ubiquitous laser of CD players  the self propagating electrical currents of superconductors  and the Bose–Einstein condensate of atoms  Albert Einstein  who  in his search for a Unified Field Theory  did not accept wave particle duality  wrote   This double nature of radiation  and of material corpuscles    has been interpreted by quantum mechanics in an ingenious and amazingly successful fashion  This interpretation   appears to me as only a temporary way out    The many worlds interpretation  MWI  is sometimes presented as a waves only theory  including by its originator  Hugh Everett who referred to MWI as  the wave interpretation    The of R  Horodecki relates the particle to wave  The hypothesis implies that a massive particle is an intrinsically spatially as well as temporally extended wave phenomenon by a nonlinear law   7 3  Neither wave nor particle view  It has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves  but only some compromise or intermediate between them  One consideration is that zero dimensional mathematical points cannot be observed  Another is that the formal representation of such points  the Kronecker delta function is unphysical  because it cannot be normalized  Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states  Roger Penrose states    Such  position states  are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite sense from the momentum states  Whereas the momentum states are infinitely spread out  the position states are infinitely concentrated  Neither is normalizable          7 4  Relational approach to wave–particle duality  Relational quantum mechanics is developed which regards the detection event as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector  The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg s uncertainty principle and thus wave–particle duality is subsequently avoided   8  Applications  Although it is difficult to draw a line separating wave–particle duality from the rest of quantum mechanics  it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea   Wave–particle duality is exploited in electron microscopy  where the small wavelengths associated with the electron can be used to view objects much smaller than what is visible using visible light   Similarly  neutron diffraction uses neutrons with a wavelength of about 0 1 nm  the typical spacing of atoms in a solid  to determine the structure of solids   9  See also  Arago spot  Afshar experiment  Basic concepts of quantum mechanics  Complementarity  physics   Kapitsa–Dirac effect  Electron wave
