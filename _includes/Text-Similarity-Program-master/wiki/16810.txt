Konrad Zuse    22 June 1910 – 18 December 1995  was a German civil engineer  inventor and computer pioneer  His greatest achievement was the world s first programmable computer  the functional program controlled Turing complete Z3 became operational in May 1941  Thanks to this machine and its predecessors  Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer   Zuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine  considered the first process controlled computer  He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941  producing the Z4  which became the world s first commercial computer  From 1943 to 1945 he designed the first high level programming language  Plankalkül  In 1969  Zuse suggested the concept of a computation based universe in his book Rechnender Raum  Calculating Space    Much of his early work was financed by his family and commerce  but after 1939 he was given resources by the Nazi German government  Due to World War II  Zuse s work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States  Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM s option on his patents in 1946   There is a replica of the Z3  as well as the original Z4  in the Deutsches Museum in Munich  The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse  displaying twelve of his machines  including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse s paintings   1  Pre World War II work and the Z1  Born in Berlin  Germany  on 22 June 1910  he moved with his family in 1912 to Braunsberg  East Prussia  where his father was a postal clerk  Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg  In 1923  the family moved to Hoyerswerda  where he passed his Abitur in 1928  qualifying him to enter university   He enrolled in the Technische Hochschule Berlin Charlottenburg and explored both engineering and architecture  but found them boring  Zuse then pursued civil engineering  graduating in 1935  For a time  he worked for the Ford Motor Company  using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements  He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin  This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand  which he found mind numbingly boring  leading him to dream of doing them by machine   Beginning in 1935 he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents  flat on Wrangelstraße 38  moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10  the street leading up the Kreuzberg  Berlin  Working in his parents  apartment in 1936  his first attempt  called the Z1  was a floating point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability  reading instructions from a perforated 35 mm film  In 1937  Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture  He finished the Z1 in 1938  The Z1 contained some 30 000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision  On 30 January 1944  the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents  flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II   Between 1987 and 1989  Zuse recreated the Z1  suffering a heart attack midway through the project  It cost 800 000 DM   approximately $500 000  and required four individuals  including Zuse  to assemble it  Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies   2  The Z2  Z3  and Z4  Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day  Between 1936 and 1945  he was in near total intellectual isolation  In 1939  Zuse was called to military service  where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2  In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2  covering several rooms in the parental flat  to experts of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt  DVL  i e  German Research Institute for Aviation   The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays   The DVL granted research subsidies so that in 1941 Zuse started a company  Zuse Apparatebau  Zuse Apparatus Construction   to manufacture his machines  renting a workshop on the opposite side in Methfesselstraße 7 and stretching through the block to Belle Alliance Straße 29  renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947    Improving on the basic Z2 machine  he built the Z3 in 1941  On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3  built in his workshop  to the public  The Z3 was a binary 22 bit floating point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps  with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays  The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock  Despite the absence of conditional jumps  the Z3 was a Turing complete computer  ignoring the fact that no physical computer can be truly Turing complete because of limited storage size   However  Turing completeness was never considered by Zuse  who had practical applications in mind  and only demonstrated in 1998  see History of computing hardware    The Z3  the first fully operational electromechanical computer  was partially financed by German government supported DVL  which wanted their extensive calculations automated  A request by his co worker Helmut Schreyer—who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938—for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as  strategically unimportant    In 1937  Schreyer had advised Zuse to use vacuum tubes as switching elements  Zuse at this time considered it a crazy idea   Schnapsidee  in his own words   Zuse s workshop on Methfesselstraße 7  with the Z3  was destroyed in an Allied Air raid in late 1943 and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year  whereas the successor Z4  which Zuse had begun constructing in 1942 in a new premise in the Industriehof on Oranienstraße 6  remained intact  On 3 February 1945  aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt  the area around Oranienstraße  including neighbouring houses  This event effectively brought Zuse s research and developement to a complete halt  The partially finished  relay based Z4 was packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February  only arriving in Göttingen two weeks later   Work on the Z4 could not be resumed immediately in the extreme privation of post war Germany  and it was not until 1949 that he was able to resume work on it  He showed it to the mathematician Eduard Stiefel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich  Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule  ETH  Zürich  who ordered one in 1950  On 8 November 1949  Zuse KG was founded  The Z4 was delivered to ETH Zurich on 12 July 1950  and proved very reliable   3  S1 and S2  In 1940  the German government began funding him through the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt  AVA  Aerodynamic Research Institute  forerunner of the DLR   which used his work for the production of glide bombs  Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines  which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio controlled flying bombs  The S2 featured an integrated analog to digital converter under program control  making it the first process controlled computer   These machines contributed to the Henschel Werke Hs 293 and Hs 294 guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945  which were the precursors to the modern cruise missile  The circuit design of the S1 was the predecessor of Zuse s Z11  Zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying Soviet troops in 1945   4  Plankalkül  While working on his Z4 computer  Zuse realised that programming in machine code was too complicated  He started working on a PhD thesis containing groundbreaking research years ahead of its time  mainly the first high level programming language  Plankalkül   Plan Calculus   and  as an elaborate example program  the first real computer chess engine  After the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing  he flew from Berlin for the rural Allgäu  and  unable to do any hardware development  he continued working on the Plankalkül  eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959  the work in its entirety  however  remained unpublished until 1972  The PhD thesis was submitted at University of Augsburg  but rejected for formal reasons  because Zuse forgot to pay the 400 Mark university enrollment fee   The rejection did not bother him   The Plankalkül remained a theoretical contribution  since the language was not implemented in his lifetime and did not directly influence subsequent early languages  Heinz Rutishauser  one of the inventors of ALGOL  wrote   The very first attempt to devise an algorithmic language was undertaken in 1948 by K  Zuse  His notation was quite general  but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved   No compiler or interpreter was available for Plankalkül until a team from the Free University of Berlin implemented one in 2000  However  Donald Knuth suggests a gedankenexperiment  What might have happened  had the bombing not taken place  and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned   5  Personal life  Konrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945   employing a carriage  himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil  for Zuse attached importance to a  noble ceremony   Their son Horst  the first of five children  was born in November 1945   While Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party  he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort  Much later  he suggested that in modern times  the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain  or not pursuing their line of work at all   After he retired  he focused on his hobby of painting   Zuse was an atheist   6  Death  Zuse died on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld  Germany  near Fulda  from heart failure   7  Zuse the entrepreneur  In 1946  Zuse founded one of the earliest computer companies  the Zuse Ingenieurbüro Hopferau  Capital was raised through ETH Zurich and an IBM option on Zuse s patents   Zuse founded another company  Zuse KG in Haunetal Neukirchen in 1949  in 1957 the company’s head office moved to Bad Hersfeld  The Z4 was finished and delivered to the ETH Zurich  Switzerland in September 1950  At that time  it was the only working computer in continental Europe  and the second computer in the world to be sold  only beaten by the BINAC  which never worked properly after it was delivered  Other computers  all numbered with a leading Z  up to Z43  were built by Zuse and his company  Notable are the Z11  which was sold to the optics industry and to universities  and the Z22  the first computer with a memory based on magnetic storage   By 1967  the Zuse KG had built a total of 251 computers  Due to financial problems  the company was then sold to Siemens   8  Calculating Space  In 1967  Zuse also suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure  digital physics   in 1969  he published the book Rechnender Raum  translated into English as Calculating Space   This idea has attracted a lot of attention  since there is no physical evidence against Zuse s thesis  Edward Fredkin  1980s   Jürgen Schmidhuber  1990s   and others have expanded on it   9  Awards and honours  Zuse received several awards for his work   Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964  together with Fritz Leonhardt and Walter Schottky   Harry H  Goode Memorial Award in 1965  together with George Stibitz   Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1972   Great Cross of Merit  Computer History Museum Fellow Award in 1999 The Zuse Institute Berlin is named in his honour   The Konrad Zuse Medal of the Gesellschaft für Informatik  and the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes  Central Association of German Construction   are both named after Zuse   10  Zuse Year 2010  The 100th anniversary of the birth of this computer pioneer was celebrated by exhibitions  lectures and workshops to remember his life and work and to bring attention to the importance of his invention to the digital age  The movie Tron  Legacy  which revolves around a world inside a computer system  features a character named Zuse  presumably in honour of Konrad Zuse   11  Literature  Konrad Zuse  The
