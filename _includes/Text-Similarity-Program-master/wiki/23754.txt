Parapsychology is a field of study concerned with the investigation of paranormal and psychic phenomena  Parapsychologists study telepathy  precognition  clairvoyance  psychokinesis  near death experiences  reincarnation  apparitional experiences  and other paranormal claims   Parapsychology research is largely conducted by private institutions in several different countries and funded through private donations  and the subject rarely appears in mainstream science journals  Most papers about parapsychology are published in a small number of niche journals  Most scientists regard parapsychology as pseudoscience  Parapsychology has been criticised for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research   1  Terminology  Para is from Greek  and means  beside  closely related to  beyond     The term parapsychology was coined in or around 1889 by the philosopher Max Dessoir  It was adopted by J B  Rhine in the 1930s as a replacement for the term psychical research in order to indicate a significant shift toward experimental methodology and academic discipline  The term originates from the meaning  alongside   and psychology   In parapsychology  psi is the unknown factor in extrasensory perception and psychokinesis experiences that is not explained by known physical or biological mechanisms  The term is derived from the Greek ψ psi  23rd letter of the Greek alphabet and the initial letter of the Greek ψυχή psyche   mind  soul   The term was coined by biologist Berthold P  Wiesner  and first used by psychologist Robert Thouless in a 1942 article published in the British Journal of Psychology   The Parapsychological Association divides psi into two main categories  psi gamma for extrasensory perception and psi kappa for psychokinesis  In popular culture   psi  has become more and more synonymous with special psychic  mental  and  psionic  abilities and powers   2  History  2 1  Early psychical research  The Society for Psychical Research was founded in London in 1882  Its formation was the first systematic effort to organize scientists and scholars to investigate paranormal phenomena  Early membership included philosophers  scholars  scientists  educators and politicians  such as Henry Sidgwick  Arthur Balfour  William Crookes  Rufus Osgood Mason and Nobel Laureate Charles Richet  Presidents of the Society included  in addition to Richet  Eleanor Sidgwick and William James  and subsequently Nobel Laureates Henri Bergson and Lord Rayleigh  and philosopher C  D  Broad   Areas of study included telepathy  hypnotism  Reichenbach s phenomena  apparitions  hauntings  and the physical aspects of Spiritualism such as table tilting  materialization and apportation  The Society for Psychical Research published a Census of Hallucinations  which researched apparitional experiences and hallucinations in the sane  The census was the Society s first attempt at a statistical evaluation of paranormal phenomena  and the resulting publication in 1886  Phantasms of the Living is still widely referenced in parapsychological literature today  The SPR became the model for similar societies in other European countries and the United States during the late 19th century   Early clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by Charles Richet  Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them  The subject was reported to have been successful in a series of 133 trials but the results dropped to chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge  J  M  Peirce and E  C  Pickering reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23 384 trials which did not obtain above chance scores   Largely due to the support of psychologist William James  the American Society for Psychical Research  ASPR  opened its doors in Boston in 1885  moving to New York City in 1905 under the leadership of James H  Hyslop  The SPR and ASPR continue research in parapsychology   2 2  Rhine era  In 1911  Stanford University became the first academic institution in the United States to study extrasensory perception  ESP  and psychokinesis  PK  in a laboratory setting  The effort was headed by psychologist John Edgar Coover  and was supported by funds donated by Thomas Welton Stanford  brother of the university s founder  In 1930  Duke University became the second major U S  academic institution to engage in the critical study of ESP and psychokinesis in the laboratory  Under the guidance of psychologist William McDougall  and with the help of others in the department—including psychologists Karl Zener  Joseph B  Rhine  and Louisa E  Rhine—laboratory ESP experiments using volunteer subjects from the undergraduate student body began  As opposed to the approaches of psychical research  which generally sought qualitative evidence for paranormal phenomena  the experiments at Duke University proffered a quantitative  statistical approach using cards and dice  As a consequence of the ESP experiments at Duke  standard laboratory procedures for the testing of ESP developed and came to be adopted by interested researchers throughout the world   George Estabrooks conducted an ESP experiment using cards in 1927  Harvard students were used as the subjects  Estabrooks acted as the sender with the guesser in an adjoining room  In total 2  300 trials were conducted  When the subjects were sent to a distant room with insulation the scores dropped to chance level  Attempts to repeat the experiment also failed   The publication of J  B  Rhine s book  New Frontiers of the Mind  1937  brought the laboratory s findings to the general public  In his book  Rhine popularized the word  parapsychology   which psychologist Max Dessoir had coined over 40 years earlier  to describe the research conducted at Duke  Rhine also founded an autonomous Parapsychology Laboratory within Duke and started the Journal of Parapsychology  which he co edited with McDougall   Rhine  along with associate Karl Zener  had developed a statistical system of testing for ESP that involved subjects guessing what symbol  out of five possible symbols  would appear when going through a special deck of cards designed for this purpose  A percentage of correct guesses  or hits  significantly above 20% was perceived as higher than chance and indicative of psychic ability  Rhine stated in his first book  ExtraSensory Perception  1934   that after 90 000 trials  he felt ESP is  an actual and demonstrable occurrence    Irish medium and parapsychologist  Eileen Garrett  was tested by Rhine at Duke University in 1933 with Zener cards  Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope  and she was asked to guess their contents  She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a psychic energy called  energy stimulus  and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order  The parapsychologist Samuel Soal and his colleagues tested Garrett in May  1937  Most of the experiments were carried out in the Psychological Laboratory at the University College London  A total of over 12 000 guesses were recorded but Garrett failed to produce above chance level  In his report Soal wrote  In the case of Mrs  Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest confirmation of Dr  J  B  Rhine s remarkable claims relating to her alleged powers of extra sensory perception  Not only did she fail when I took charge of the experiments  but she failed equally when four other carefully trained experimenters took my place    The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked much criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP  A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine s experiments with failure  W  S  Cox  1936  from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25  064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment  Cox concluded  There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the  average man  or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group  The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects   Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine s results   In 1938  the psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal  biased  dubious and the result of  faulty observation and familiar human frailties   Rhine s experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues   Illusionist Milbourne Christopher wrote years later that he felt  there are at least a dozen ways a subject who wished to cheat under the conditions Rhine described could deceive the investigator   When Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods  he was unable to find any high scoring subjects  Another criticism  made by chemist Irving Langmuir  among others  was one of selective reporting  Langmuir stated that Rhine did not report scores of subjects that he suspected were intentionally guessing wrong  and that this  he felt  biased the statistical results higher than they should have been   Rhine and his colleagues attempted to address these criticisms through new experiments described in the book Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years  1940   Rhine described three experiments the Pearce Pratt experiment  the Pratt Woodruff experiment and the Ownbey Zirkle series which he believed demonstrated ESP  However  C  E  M  Hansel wrote  it is now known that each experiment contained serious flaws that escaped notice in the examination made by the authors of Extra Sensory Perception After Sixty Years   Joseph Gaither Pratt was the co experimenter in the Pearce Pratt and Pratt Woodruff experiments at the Duke campus  Hansel visited the campus where the experiments took place and discovered the results could have originated through the use of a trick so could not regarded as supplying evidence for ESP   In 1957  Rhine and Joseph Gaither Pratt wrote Parapsychology  Frontier Science of the Mind  Because of the methodological problems  parapsychologists no longer utilize card guessing studies  Rhine s experiments into psychokinesis  PK  were also criticized  John Sladek wrote   His research used dice  with subjects  willing  them to fall a certain way  Not only can dice be drilled  shaved  falsely numbered and manipulated  but even straight dice often show bias in the long run  Casinos for this reason retire dice often  but at Duke  subjects continued to try for the same effect on the same dice over long experimental runs  Not surprisingly  PK appeared at Duke and nowhere else  The Ownbey Zirkle ESP experiment at Duke was criticized by parapsychologists and skeptics  Ownbey would attempt to send ESP symbols to Zirkle who would guess what they were  The pair were placed in adjacent rooms unable to see each other and an electric fan was used to prevent the pair communicating by sensory cues  Ownbey tapped a telegraph key to Zirkle to inform him when she was trying to send him a symbol  The door separating the two rooms was open during the experiment  and after each guess Zirkle would call out his guess to Ownbey who recorded his choice  Critics pointed out the experiment was flawed as Ownbey acted as both the sender and the experimenter  nobody was controlling the experiment so Ownbey could have cheated by communicating with Zirkle or made recording mistakes   The Turner Ownbey long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws  May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away  For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses  The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J  B  Rhine  however  Ownbey sent them to Turner  Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other  When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average   A famous ESP experiment at the Duke University was performed by Lucien Warner and Mildred Raible  The subject was locked in a room with a switch controlling a signal light elsewhere  which he could signal to guess the card  Ten runs with ESP packs of cards were used and he achieved 93 hits  43 more than chance   Weaknesses with the experiment were later discovered  The duration of the light signal could be varied so that the subject could call for specific symbols and certain symbols in the experiment came up far more often than others which indicated either poor shuffling or card manipulation  The experiment was not repeated   The administration of Duke grew less sympathetic to parapsychology  and after Rhine s retirement in 1965 parapsychological links with the university were broken  Rhine later established the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man  FRNM  and the Institute for Parapsychology as a successor to the Duke laboratory  In 1995  the centenary of Rhine s birth  the FRNM was renamed the Rhine Research Center  Today  the Rhine Research Center is a parapsychology research unit  stating that it  aims to improve the human condition by creating a scientific understanding of those abilities and sensitivities that appear to transcend the ordinary limits of space and time    2 3  Establishment of the Parapsychological Association  The Parapsychological Association  PA  was created in Durham  North Carolina  on June 19  1957  Its formation was proposed by J  B  Rhine at a workshop on parapsychology which was held at the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University  Rhine proposed that the group form itself into the nucleus of an international professional society in parapsychology  The aim of the organization  as stated in its Constitution  became  to advance parapsychology as a science  to disseminate knowledge of the field  and to integrate the findings with those of other branches of science    In 1969  under the direction of anthropologist Margaret Mead  the Parapsychological Association became affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science  AAAS   the largest general scientific society in the world  In 1979  physicist John A  Wheeler said that parapsychology is pseudoscientific  and that the affiliation of the PA to the AAAS needed to be reconsidered   His challenge to parapsychology s AAAS affiliation was unsuccessful  Today  the PA consists of about three hundred full  associate  and affiliated members worldwide   2 4  MKULTRA and The Stargate Project  Beginning in the early 1950s  the CIA started extensive research into behavioral engineering  Various experiments were undertaken in the process of this research  including some using various hallucinogenic substances  The findings from these experiments led to the formation of the Stargate Project  which handled ESP research for the U S  federal government   The Stargate Project was terminated in 1995 with the conclusion that it was never useful in any intelligence operation  The information was vague and included a lot of irrelevant and erroneous data  There was also reason to suspect that the research managers had adjusted their project reports to fit the known background cues   2 5  The 1970s and 1980s  The affiliation of the Parapsychological Association  PA  with the American Association for the Advancement of Science  along with a general openness to psychic and occult phenomena in the 1970s  led to a decade of increased parapsychological research  During this period  other related organizations were also formed  including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine  1970   the Institute of Parascience  1971   the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research  the Institute of Noetic Sciences  1973   the International Kirlian Research Association  1975   and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory  1979   Parapsychological work was also conducted at the Stanford Research Institute  SRI  during this time   The scope of parapsychology expanded during these years  Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson conducted much of his research into reincarnation during the 1970s  and the second edition of his Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation was published in 1974  Psychologist Thelma Moss devoted time to the study of Kirlian photography at UCLA s parapsychology laboratory  The influx of spiritual teachers from Asia  and their claims of abilities produced by meditation  led to research on altered states of consciousness  American Society for Psychical Research Director of Research  Karlis Osis  conducted experiments in out of body experiences  Physicist Russell Targ coined the term remote viewing for use in some of his work at SRI in 1974   The surge in paranormal research continued into the 1980s  the Parapsychological Association reported members working in more than 30 countries  For example  research was carried out and regular conferences held in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union although the word parapsychology was discarded in favour of the term psychotronics  The promoter of psychotronics was Czech scientist Zdeněk Rejdák  Rejdák kept enforcing the psychotronics as a physical science on the world wide scale and for many years  he organized conferences on research in psychotronics  The psychotronics of this era is being understood as a new science in the terms of human bionics  The main objectives of psychotronics were to verify and study distant interactions human organism and its information and energy expressions and subsequently the phenomena of telepathy  clairvoyance and psychokinesis  to discover new principles of nature   In 1985 a Chair of Parapsychology was established within the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh  Robert Morris  a respected experimental parapsychologist from the United States took up the position  and with his research associates and PhD students pursued a comprehensive research programme  Since Professor Morris  death in 2004 the Chair of Parapsychology has remained vacant   2 6  Modern Era  Since the 1980s  contemporary parapsychological research has waned considerably in the United States  Early research was considered inconclusive  and parapsychologists were faced with strong opposition from their academic colleagues  Some effects thought to be paranormal  for example the effects of Kirlian photography  thought by some to represent a human aura   disappeared under more stringent controls  leaving those avenues of research at dead ends  Many university laboratories in the United States have closed  citing a lack of acceptance by mainstream science as the reason  the bulk of parapsychology research in the US is now confined to private institutions funded by private sources  After 28 years of research  Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory  PEAR   which studied psychokinesis  closed in 2007   Two universities in the United States currently have academic parapsychology laboratories  The Division of Perceptual Studies  a unit at the University of Virginia s Department of Psychiatric Medicine  studies the possibility of survival of consciousness after bodily death  near death experiences  and out of body experiences  The University of Arizona s Veritas Laboratory conducts laboratory investigations of mediums  Several private institutions  including the Institute of Noetic Sciences  conduct and promote parapsychological research   Over the last two decades some new sources of funding for parapsychology in Europe have seen a  substantial increase in European parapsychological research so that the center of gravity for the field has swung from the United States to Europe   Of all nations the United Kingdom has the largest number of active parapsychologists  In the UK  researchers work in conventional psychology departments  and also do studies in mainstream psychology to  boost their credibility and show that their methods are sound   It is thought that this approach could account for the relative strength of parapsychology in Britain   As of 2007  parapsychology research is represented in some 30 different countries and a number of universities worldwide continue academic parapsychology programs  Among these are the Koestler Parapsychology Unit at the University of Edinburgh  the Parapsychology Research Group at Liverpool Hope University  this closed in April 2011   the SOPHIA Project at the University of Arizona  the Consciousness and Transpersonal Psychology Research Unit of Liverpool John Moores University  the Center for the Study of Anomalous Psychological Processes at the University of Northampton  and the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths  University of London   Research and professional organizations include the Parapsychological Association  the Society for Psychical Research  publisher of the Journal of Society for Psychical Research  the American Society for Psychical Research  publisher of the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research  last published in 2004   the Rhine Research Center and Institute for Parapsychology  publisher of the Journal of Parapsychology  the Parapsychology Foundation  which published the International Journal of Parapsychology  between 1959 to 1968 and 2000–2001  and the Australian Institute of Parapsychological Research  publisher of the Australian Journal of Parapsychology  The European Journal of Parapsychology ceased publishing in 2010   Parapsychological research has also been augmented by other sub disciplines of psychology  These related fields include transpersonal psychology  which studies transcendent or spiritual aspects of the human mind  and anomalistic psychology  which examines paranormal beliefs and subjective anomalous experiences in traditional psychological terms   3  Research  3 1  Scope  Parapsychologists study a number of ostensible paranormal phenomena  including but not limited to   Telepathy  Transfer of information on thoughts or feelings between individuals by means other than the five classical senses   Precognition  Perception of information about future places or events before they occur   Clairvoyance  Obtaining information about places or events at remote locations  by means unknown to current science   Psychokinesis  The ability of the mind to influence matter  time  space  or energy by means unknown to current science   Near death experiences  An experience reported by a person who nearly died  or who experienced clinical death and then revived   Reincarnation  The rebirth of a soul or other non physical aspect of human consciousness in a new physical body after death   Apparitional experiences  Phenomena often attributed to ghosts and encountered in places a deceased individual is thought to have frequented  or in association with the person s former belongings  The definitions for the terms above may not reflect their mainstream usage  nor the opinions of all parapsychologists and their critics   According to the Parapsychological Association  parapsychologists do not study all paranormal phenomena  nor are they concerned with astrology  UFOs  Bigfoot  paganism  vampires  alchemy  or witchcraft   Journals dealing with parapsychology include the Journal of Parapsychology  Journal of Near Death Studies  Journal of Consciousness Studies  Journal of the Society for Psychical Research and Journal of Scientific Exploration   3 2  Methodology  Parapsychologists employ a variety of approaches for the study of apparent paranormal phenomena  These methods include qualitative approaches used in traditional psychology  but also quantitative empirical methodologies   3 3  Experimental research  3 3 1  Ganzfeld  The Ganzfeld  German for  whole field   is a technique used to test individuals for telepathy  The technique—a form of moderate sensory deprivation—was developed to quickly quiet mental  noise  by providing mild  unpatterned stimuli to the visual and auditory senses  The visual sense is usually isolated by creating a soft red glow which is diffused through half ping pong balls placed over the recipient s eyes  The auditory sense is usually blocked by playing white noise  static  or similar sounds to the recipient  The subject is also seated in a reclined  comfortable position to minimize the sense of touch   In the typical Ganzfeld experiment  a  sender  and a  receiver  are isolated  The receiver is put into the Ganzfeld state or Ganzfeld effect and the sender is shown a video clip or still picture and asked to mentally send that image to the receiver  The receiver  while in the Ganzfeld  is asked to continuously speak aloud all mental processes  including images  thoughts  and feelings  At the end of the sending period  typically about 20 to 40 minutes in length  the receiver is taken out of the Ganzfeld state and shown four images or videos  one of which is the true target and three of which are non target decoys  The receiver attempts to select the true target  using perceptions experienced during the Ganzfeld state as clues to what the mentally  sent  image might have been   The ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented  Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues  Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to assess each experiment  he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws  Six of these concerned statistical defects  the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation  randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage  Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws  Because of the flaws  Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi   Possibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender s room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender s fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see  Hyman reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place  Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage   In 2010  Lance Storm  Patrizio Tressoldi  and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008  Of the 1 498 trials  483 produced hits  corresponding to a hit rate of 32 2%  This hit rate is statistically significant with p    001  Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition  Hyman  2010  published a rebuttal to Storm et al  According to Hyman  reliance on meta analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious  It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence   Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for psi  Storm et al  published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary  Rouder et al  2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm et al  s meta analysis reveals no evidence for psi  no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures   3 3 2  Remote viewing  Remote viewing is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target using subjective means  in particular  extrasensory perception  Typically a remote viewer is expected to give information about an object  event  person or location that is hidden from physical view and separated at some distance  Several hundred such trials have been conducted by investigators over the past 25 years  including those by the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory  PEAR  and by scientists at SRI International and Science Applications International Corporation  Many of these were under contract by the U S  government as part of the espionage program Stargate Project  which terminated in 1995 having failed  in the government s eyes  to document any practical intelligence value   The psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff’s remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute  In a series of 35 studies  they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments  Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff s experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out  such as referring to yesterday s two targets  or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page  They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment s high hit rates  Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues  James Randi has written controlled tests by several other researchers  eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests  produced negative results  Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ s locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts   In 1980  Charles Tart claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff’s experiments revealed an above chance result  Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues  Marks and Christopher Scott  1986  wrote  considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal  Tart’s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension  As previously concluded  remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ  only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues    PEAR closed its doors at the end of February 2007  Its founder  Robert G  Jahn  said of it that   For 28 years  we’ve done what we wanted to do  and there’s no reason to stay and generate more of the same data   Statistical flaws in his work have been proposed by others in the parapsychological community and within the general scientific community  The physicist Robert L  Park said of PEAR   It’s been an embarrassment to science  and I think an embarrassment for Princeton    3 3 3  Psychokinesis on random number generators  The advent of powerful and inexpensive electronic and computer technologies has allowed the development of fully automated experiments studying possible interactions between mind and matter  In the most common experiment of this type  a random number generator  RNG   based on electronic or radioactive noise  produces a data stream that is recorded and analyzed by computer software  A subject attempts to mentally alter the distribution of the random numbers  usually in an experimental design that is functionally equivalent to getting more  heads  than  tails  while flipping a coin  In the RNG experiment  design flexibility can be combined with rigorous controls  while collecting a large amount of data in very short period of time  This technique has been used both to test individuals for psychokinesis and to test the possible influence on RNGs of large groups of people   Major meta analyses of the RNG database have been published every few years since appearing in the journal Foundations of Physics in 1986  PEAR founder Robert G  Jahn and his colleague Brenda Dunne say that the experiments produced  a very small effect  not large enough to be observed over a brief experiment but over a large number of trials was able to produce a tiny statistical deviation from chance  According to Massimo Pigliucci the results from PEAR can be explained without invoking the paranormal because of two problems with the experiment  the difficulty of designing machines capable of generating truly random events and the fact that statistical  significance  is not at all a good measure of the importance or genuineness of a phenomenon   Pigluicci has written the statistical analysis used by the Jahn and the PEAR group relied on a quantity called a  p value  but a problem with p values is that if the sample size  number of trials  is very large like PEAR then one is guaranteed to find artificially low p values indicating a statistical  significant  result even though nothing was occurring other than small biases in the experimental apparatus   Two German independent scientific groups have failed to replicate the PEAR results  Pigliucci has written this was  yet another indication that the simplest hypothesis is likely to be true  there was nothing to replicate   The most recent meta analysis on psychokinesis was published in Psychological Bulletin  along with several critical commentaries  It analyzed the results of 380 studies  the authors reported an overall positive effect size that was statistically significant but very small relative to the sample size and could  in principle  be explained by publication bias   3 3 4  Direct mental interactions with living systems  Formerly called bio PK   direct mental interactions with living systems   DMILS  studies the effects of one person s intentions on a distant person s psychophysiological state  One type of DMILS experiment looks at the commonly reported  feeling of being stared at   The  starer  and the  staree  are isolated in different locations  and the starer is periodically asked to simply gaze at the staree via closed circuit video links  Meanwhile  the staree s nervous system activity is automatically and continuously monitored   Parapsychologists have interpreted the cumulative data on this and similar DMILS experiments to suggest that one person s attention directed towards a remote  isolated person can significantly activate or calm that person s nervous system  In a meta analysis of these experiments published in the British Journal of Psychology in 2004  researchers found that there was a small but significant overall DMILS effect  However  the study also found that when a small number of the highest quality studies from one laboratory were analyzed  the effect size was not significant  The authors concluded that although the existence of some anomaly related to distant intentions cannot be ruled out  there was also a shortage of independent replications and theoretical concepts   3 4  Dream telepathy  Parapsychological studies into dream telepathy were carried out at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn  New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman  They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy  However  the results have not been independently replicated   The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C  E  M  Hansel  According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture  Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed  however  an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened  Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject  In 2002  Krippner denied Hansel s accusations claiming the agent did not communicate with the experimenter   An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes  The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level  Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative   In 2003  Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides  However  James Alcock noted that their review was based on  extreme messiness  of data  Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and  lack of replication is rampant    3 5  Near death experiences  A near death experience  NDE  is an experience reported by a person who nearly died  or who experienced clinical death and then revived  NDEs include one or more of the following experiences  a sense of being dead  an out of body experience  a sensation of floating above one s body and seeing the surrounding area  a sense of overwhelming love and peace  a sensation of moving upwards through a tunnel or narrow passageway  meeting deceased relatives or spiritual figures  encountering a being of light  or a light  experiencing a life review  reaching a border or boundary  and a feeling of being returned to the body  often accompanied by reluctance   Interest in the NDE was originally spurred by the research of psychiatrists Elisabeth Kübler Ross  George G  Ritchie  and Raymond Moody  In 1975  Moody wrote the best selling book Life After Life and in 1977 he wrote a second book  Reflections on Life After Life  In 1998 Moody was appointed chair in  consciousness studies  at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas  The International Association for Near death Studies  IANDS  was founded in 1978 to meet the needs of early researchers and experiencers within this field of research  Later researchers  such as psychiatrist Bruce Greyson  psychologist Kenneth Ring  and cardiologist Michael Sabom  introduced the study of near death experiences to the academic setting   3 6  Reincarnation research  Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson  from the University of Virginia  conducted more than 2 500 case studies over a period of 40 years and published twelve books  He found that childhood memories ostensibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years then fade shortly afterwards  He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased  attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased s family had occurred  and searched for disconfirming evidence that could provide alternative explanations for the reports aside from reincarnation   Some 35 per cent of the subjects examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects  Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children  when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased  provided the best evidence for reincarnation  However  Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation  and cautiously referred to his cases as being  of the reincarnation type  or  suggestive of reincarnation   Researchers who believe in the evidence for reincarnation have been unsuccessful in getting the scientific community to consider it a serious possibility   Ian Wilson argued that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a higher caste  He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation  The philosopher Keith Augustine has written  the vast majority of Stevenson s cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong  and rarely elsewhere  seems to indicate that cultural conditioning  rather than reincarnation  generates claims of spontaneous past life memories   According to the research of Robert Baker many of the alleged past life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists can be explained in terms of known psychological factors  Baker has written the recalling of past lives is a mixture of cryptomnesia and confabulation  The philosopher Paul Edwards noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions and is inconsistent with modern science   Stevenson retired in 2002  and psychiatrist Jim B  Tucker took over his work  Tucker  an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia  presented an overview of Stevenson s research into reincarnation in Life Before Life  A Scientific Investigation of Children’s Memories of Previous Lives   4  Scientific reception  4 1  Evaluation  The scientific consensus does not view psi as a real phenomenon   Scientists critical of parapsychology state that its extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence if they are to be taken seriously  Scientists who have evaluated parapsychology have written the entire body of evidence is of poor quality and not adequately controlled  In support of this view  critics cite instances of fraud  flawed studies  and cognitive biases  such as clustering illusion  availability error  confirmation bias  illusion of control  magical thinking  and the bias blind spot  as ways to explain parapsychological results  Research has also shown that people s desire to believe in paranormal phenomena causes them to discount strong evidence that it does not exist   The psychologists Donovan Rawcliffe  1952   C  E  M  Hansel  1980   Ray Hyman  1989  and Andrew Neher  2011  have studied the history of psi experiments from the late 19th century up until the 1980s  In every experiment investigated  flaws and weaknesses were discovered so the possibility of sensory leakage and trickery were not ruled out  The data from the Creery sister and the Soal Goldney experiments were proven to be fraudulent  one of the subjects from the Smith Blackburn experiments confessed to fraud  the Brugmans experiment  the experiments by John E  Coover and those conducted by Joseph Gaither Pratt and Helmut Schmidt had flaws in the design of the experiments  did not rule out the possibility of sensory cues or trickery and have not been replicated   According to critics  psi is negatively defined as any effect that cannot be currently explained in terms of chance or normal causes and this is a fallacy as it encourages parapsychologists into using any peculiarity in the data as a characteristic of psi  Parapsychologists have admitted it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of non paranormal causes in their experiments  There is no independent method to indicate the presence or absence of psi  Persi Diaconis has written that the controls in parapsychological experiments are often loose with possibilities of subject cheating and unconscious sensory cues   The existence of parapsychological phenomena and the scientific validity of parapsychological research is disputed by independent evaluators and researchers  In 1988  the U S  National Academy of Sciences published a report on the subject that concluded that  no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena   No accepted theory of parapsychology currently exists  and many competing and often conflicting models have been advocated by different parapsychologists in an attempt to explain reported paranormal phenomena  Terence Hines in his book Pseudoscience and the Paranormal  2003  wrote  Many theories have been proposed by parapsychologists to explain how psi takes place  To skeptics  such theory building seems premature  as the phenomena to be explained by the theories have yet to be demonstrated convincingly   Skeptics such as Antony Flew have cited the lack of such a theory as their reason for rejecting parapsychology   In 1998  physics professor Michael Friedlander noted that parapsychology has  failed to produce any clear evidence for the existence of anomalous effects that require us to go beyond the known region of science   The philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll has written research in parapsychology has been characterized by  deception  fraud  and incompetence in setting up properly controlled experiments and evaluating statistical data   The psychologist Ray Hyman has pointed out that some parapsychologists such as Dick Bierman  Walter Lucadou  J  E  Kennedy  and Robert Jahn have admitted the evidence for psi is  inconsistent  irreproducible  and fails to meet acceptable scientific standards   Richard Wiseman has criticized the parapsychological community for widespread errors in research methods including cherry picking new procedures which may produce preferred results  explaining away unsuccessful attempted replications with claims of an  experimenter effect   data mining  and retrospective data selection   In a review of parapsychological reports Hyman wrote  randomization is often inadequate  multiple statistical testing without adjustment for significance levels is prevalent  possibilities for sensory leakage are not uniformly prevented  errors in use of statistical tests are much too common  and documentation is typically inadequate   Parapsychology has been criticized for making no precise predictions  In 2003  James Alcock Professor of Psychology at York University published Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance  Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi  where he claimed that parapsychologists never seem to take seriously the possibility that psi does not exist  Because of that  they interpret null results as indicating only that they were unable to observe psi in a particular experiment  rather than taking it as support for the possibility that there is no psi  The failure to take the null hypothesis as a serious alternative to their psi hypotheses leads them to rely upon a number of arbitrary  effects  to excuse failures to find predicted effects  excuse the lack of consistency in outcomes  and to excuse failures to replicate   Basic endemic problems in parapsychological research include amongst others  insufficient definition of the subject matter  total reliance on negative definitions of their phenomena  E g   psi is said to occur only when all known normal influences are ruled out   failure to produce a single phenomenon that can be independently replicated by neutral researchers  the invention of  effects  such as the psi experimenter effect to explain away inconsistencies in the data and failures to achieve predicted outcomes  unfalsifiability of claims  unpredictability of effects  lack of progress in over a century of formal research  methodological weaknesses  reliance on statistical procedures to determine when psi has supposedly occurred  even though statistical analysis does not in itself justify a claim that psi has occurred  and failure to jibe with other areas of science  Overall  he argues that there is nothing in parapsychological research that would ever lead parapsychologists to conclude that psi does not exist  and so  even if it does not  the search is likely to continue for a long time to come   I continue to believe that parapsychology is  at bottom  motivated by belief in search of data  rather than data in search of explanation    Richard Land has written that from what is known about human biology it is highly unlikely that evolution has provided humans with ESP as research has shown the recognized five senses are adequate for the evolution and survival of the species  Michael Shermer in an article Psychic Drift  Why most scientists do not believe in ESP and psi phenomena for the Scientific American wrote  the reason for skepticism is that we need replicable data and a viable theory  both of which are missing in psi research    In January 2008 the results of a study using neuroimaging were published  To provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions  the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had participants who are biologically or emotionally related  such as twins  The experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy  clairvoyance or precognition occurred  but despite this no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic stimuli and non psychic stimuli  while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on patterns of brain activation  The researchers concluded that  These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena   Other studies have attempted to test the psi hypothesis by using functional neuroimaging  A neuroscience review of the studies  Acunzo et al  2013  discovered methodological weaknesses that could account for the reported psi effects   A 2014 study discovered that schizophrenic patients have more belief in psi than healthy adults   Some researchers have become skeptical of parapsychology such as Susan Blackmore and John Taylor after years of study and no progress in demonstrating the existence of psi by the scientific method   4 2  Physics  The ideas of psi  precognition  psychokinesis and telepathy  violate well established laws of physics  Psychokinesis violates the inverse square law  the second law of thermodynamics  and the conservation of momentum  There is no known mechanism for psi   On the subject of psychokinesis the physicist Sean M  Carroll has written that both human brains and the spoons they try to bend are made  like all matter  of quarks and leptons  everything else they do is emergent properties of the behavior of quarks and leptons  And the quarks and leptons interact through the four forces  strong  weak  electromagnetic and gravitational  Thus either it s one of the four known forces or it s a new force  and any new force with range over 1 millimetre must be at most a billionth the strength of gravity or it will have been captured in experiments already done  This leaves no physical force that could possibly account for psychokinesis  Physicist John Taylor who has investigated parapsychological claims has written an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit a great deal of energy  The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms together  The atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force while it is operative than to electric forces  Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist all the time and not during only alleged paranormal occurrences  Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics  down to many orders of magnitude  thus if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved the idea of any fifth force must be discarded  Taylor concluded there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis and it is in complete contradiction to established science   Felix Planer a Professor of electrical engineering has written that if psychokinesis was real then it would be easy to demonstrate by getting subjects to depress a scale on a sensitive balance  raise the temperature of a waterbath which could be measured with an accuracy of a hundredth of a degree centigrade or affect an element in an electrical circuit such as a resistor which could be monitored to better than a millionth of an ampere  Planer writes that such experiments are extremely sensitive and easy to monitor but are not utilized by parapsychologists as they  do not hold out the remotest hope of demonstrating even a minute trace of PK  because the alleged phenomenon is non existent  Planer has written parapsychologists have to fall back on studies that involve only statistics that are unrepeatable  owing their results to poor experimental methods  recording mistakes and faulty statistical mathematics   According to Planer  All research in medicine and other sciences would become illusionary  if the existence of PK had to be taken seriously  for no experiment could be relied upon to furnish objective results  since all measurements would become falsified to a greater or lesser degree  according to his PK ability  by the experimenter s wishes   Planer concluded the concept of psychokinesis is absurd and has no scientific basis   Philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge has written that  psychokinesis  or PK  violates the principle that mind cannot act directly on matter   If it did  no experimenter could trust his readings of measuring instruments   It also violates the principles of conservation of energy and momentum  The claim that quantum mechanics allows for the possibility of mental power influencing randomizers — an alleged case of micro PK — is ludicrous since that theory respects the said conservation principles  and it deals exclusively with physical things    The physicist Robert L  Park questioned if mind really could influence matter then it would be easy for parapsychologists to measure such a phenomenon by using the alleged psychokinetic power to deflect a microbalance which would not require any dubious statistics but  the reason  of course  is that the microbalance stubbornly refuses to budge   Park has suggested the reason statistical studies are so popular in parapsychology is because they introduce opportunities for uncertainty and error which are used to support the biases of the experimenter  Park wrote  No proof of psychic phenomena is ever found  In spite of all the tests devised by parapsychologists like Jahn and Radin  and huge amounts of data collected over a period of many years  the results are no more convincing today than when they began their experiments    4 3  Pseudoscience  Parapsychological theories are viewed as pseudoscientific by the scientific community as they are incompatible with well established laws of science  As there is no repeatable evidence for psi  the scientific community consider it a pseudoscience  The philosopher Raimo Tuomela summarized why much of parapsychology is considered a pseudoscience in his essay  Science  Protoscience  and Pseudoscience    Parapsychology relies on an ill defined ontology and typically shuns exact thinking   The hypotheses and theories of parapsychology have not been proven and are in bad shape   Extremely little progress has taken place in parapsychology on the whole and parapsychology conflicts with established science   Parapsychology has poor research problems  being concerned with establishing the existence of its subject matter and having practically no theories to create proper research problems   While in parts of parapsychology there are attempts to use the methods of science there are also unscientific areas  and in any case parapsychological research can at best qualify as prescientific because of its poor theoretical foundations   Parapsychology is a largely isolated research area  The methods of parapsychologists are regarded by critics  including those who wrote the science standards for the California State Board of Education  to be pseudoscientific  Some of the more specific criticisms state that parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter  an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand  nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information  James Alcock has stated that few of parapsychology s experimental results have prompted interdisciplinary research with more mainstream sciences such as physics or biology  and that parapsychology remains an isolated science to such an extent that its very legitimacy is questionable  and as a whole is not justified in being labeled  scientific   Alcock has written  Parapsychology is indistinguishable from pseudo science  and its ideas are essentially those of magic    There is no evidence that would lead the cautious observer to believe that parapsychologists and paraphysicists are on the track of a real phenomenon  a real energy or power that has so far escaped the attention of those people engaged in  normal  science    The scientific community considers parapsychology a pseudoscience because it continues to explore the hypothesis that psychic abilities exist despite a century of experimental results that fail to conclusively demonstrate that hypothesis  A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that  despite a 130 year record of scientiﬁc research on such matters  our committee could ﬁnd no scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception  mental telepathy or ‘mind over matter’ exercises    Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist    There is also an issue of non falsifiability associated with psi  on this subject Terence Hines has written   Mario Bunge has written that research in parapsychology for over a hundred years has produced no single firm finding and no testable predictions  All parapsychologists can do is claim alleged data is anomalous and lying beyond the reach of ordinary science  The aim of parapsychologists  is not that of finding laws and systematizing them into theories in order to understand and forecast  but to  buttress ancient spiritualist myths or to serve as a surrogate for lost religions   The psychologist David Marks has written that parapsychologists have failed to produce a single repeatable demonstration of the paranormal and described psychical research as a pseudoscience an  incoherent collection of belief systems steeped in fantasy  illusion and error    4 4  Fraud  There have been instances of fraud in the history of parapsychology research  In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters  Mary  Alice  Maud  Kathleen  and Emily  were tested by the Society for Psychical Research and believed them to have genuine psychic ability however  during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud  George Albert Smith and Douglas Blackburn were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research but Blackburn confessed to fraud   The Soal–Goldney experiments of 1941–1943  suggesting precognitive ability of a single participant  were long regarded as some of the best in the field because they relied upon independent checking and witnesses to prevent fraud  However  many years later  statistical evidence  uncovered and published by other parapsychologists in the field  suggested that Dr  Soal had cheated by altering some of the raw data   In 1974  a number of experiments by Walter J  Levy  J  B  Rhine s successor as director of the Institute for Parapsychology  were exposed as fraud  Levy had reported on a series of successful ESP experiments involving computer controlled manipulation of non human subjects  including eggs and rats  His experiments showed very high positive results  Because the subjects were non human  and because the experimental environment was mostly automated  his successful experiments avoided criticism concerning experimenter effects  and removed the question of the subject s belief as an influence on the outcome  However  Levy s fellow researchers became suspicious about his methods  They found that Levy interfered with data recording equipment  manually creating fraudulent strings of positive results  Rhine fired Levy and reported the fraud in a number of articles   In 1974 Rhine published the paper Security versus Deception in Parapsychology in the Journal of Parapsychology which documented 12 cases of fraud that he had detected from 1940 to 1950 but refused to give the names of the participants in the studies  Massimo Pigliucci has written   Most damning of all  Rhine admitted publicly that he had uncovered at least twelve instances of dishonesty among his researchers in a single decade  from 1940 to 1950  However  he flaunted standard academic protocol by refusing to divulge the names of the fraudsters  which means that there is unknown number of published papers in the literature that claim paranormal effects while in fact they were the result of conscious deception  Martin Gardner claimed to have inside information that files in Rhine s laboratory contain material suggesting fraud on the part of Hubert Pearce  Pearce was never able to obtain above chance results when persons other than the experimenter were present during an experiment making it more likely that he was cheating in some way  Rhine s other subjects were only able to obtain non chance levels when they were able to shuffle the cards which has suggested they used tricks to arrange the order of the Zener cards before the experiments started  Rhine s assistant James D  MacFarland was also accused of fraud  Louisa Rhine wrote  Jim  James D  MacFarland  had actually consistently falsified his records    To produce extra hits Jim had to resort to erasures and transpositions in his records of his call series    Some instances of fraud amongst spiritualist mediums were exposed by early psychical researchers such as Richard Hodgson and Harry Price  In the 1920s  magician and escapologist Harry Houdini said that researchers and observers had not created experimental procedures which absolutely preclude fraud   4 5  Criticism of experimental results  Critical analysts  including some parapsychologists  are not satisfied with experimental parapsychology studies  Some reviewers  such as psychologist Ray Hyman  contend that apparently successful experimental results in psi research are more likely due to sloppy procedures  poorly trained researchers  or methodological flaws rather than to genuine psi effects  Within parapsychology there are disagreements over the results and methodology as well  For example  the experiments at the PEAR laboratory were criticized in a paper published by the Journal of Parapsychology in which parapsychologists independent from the PEAR laboratory concluded that these experiments  depart ed  from criteria usually expected in formal scientific experimentation  due to   p roblems with regard to randomization  statistical baselines  application of statistical models  agent coding of descriptor lists  feedback to percipients  sensory cues  and precautions against cheating   They felt that the originally stated significance values were  meaningless    A typical measure of psi phenomena is statistical deviation from chance expectation  However  critics point out that statistical deviation is  strictly speaking  only evidence of a statistical anomaly  and the cause of the deviation is not known  Hyman contends that even if psi experiments could be designed that would regularly reproduce similar deviations from chance  they would not necessarily prove psychic functioning  Critics have coined the term The Psi Assumption to describe  the assumption that any significant departure from the laws of chance in a test of psychic ability is evidence that something anomalous or paranormal has occurred    in other words  assuming what they should be proving   These critics hold that concluding the existence of psychic phenomena based on chance deviation in inadequately designed experiments is affirming the consequent or begging the question   In 1979  magician and debunker James Randi engineered a hoax  now referred to as Project Alpha to encourage a tightening of standards within the parapsychology community  Randi recruited two young magicians and sent them undercover to Washington University s McDonnell Laboratory where they   fooled researchers     into believing they had paranormal powers   The aim was to expose poor experimental methods and the credulity thought to be common in parapsychology  Randi has stated that both of his recruits deceived experimenters over a period of three years with demonstrations of supposedly psychic abilities  blowing electric fuses sealed in a box  causing a lightweight paper rotor perched atop a needle to turn inside a bell jar  bending metal spoons sealed in a glass bottle  etc  The hoax by Randi raised ethical concerns in the scientific and parapsychology communities  eliciting criticism even among skeptical communities such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal  CSICOP   which he helped found  but also positive responses from the President of the Parapsychological Association Stanley Krippner  Psychologist Ray Hyman  a CSICOP member  called the results  counterproductive    4 6  Selection bias and meta analysis  Selective reporting has been offered by critics as an explanation for the positive results reported by parapsychologists  Selective reporting is sometimes referred to as a  file drawer  problem  which arises when only positive study results are made public  while studies with negative or null results are not made public  Selective reporting has a compounded effect on meta analysis  which is a statistical technique that aggregates the results of many studies in order to generate sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a result that the individual studies themselves could not demonstrate at a statistically significant level  For example  a recent meta analysis combined 380 studies on psychokinesis  including data from the PEAR lab  It concluded that  although there is a statistically significant overall effect  it is not consistent and relatively few negative studies would cancel it out  Consequently  biased publication of positive results could be the cause   The popularity of meta analysis in parapsychology has been criticized by numerous researchers  and is often seen as troublesome even within parapsychology itself  Critics have said that parapsychologists misuse meta analysis to create the incorrect impression that statistically significant results have been obtained that indicate the existence of psi phenomena  Physicist Robert Park states that parapsychology s reported positive results are problematic because most such findings are invariably at the margin of statistical significance and that might be explained by a number of confounding effects  Park states that such marginal results are a typical symptom of pathological science as described by Irving Langmuir   Researcher J  E  Kennedy has said that concerns over the use of meta analysis in science and medicine apply as well to problems present in parapsychological meta analysis  As a post hoc analysis  critics emphasize the opportunity the method presents to produce biased outcomes via the selection of cases chosen for study  methods employed  and other key criteria  Critics say that analogous problems with meta analysis have been documented in medicine  where it has been shown different investigators performing meta analyses of the same set of studies have reached contradictory conclusions   4 7  Anomalistic psychology  In anomalistic psychology  paranormal phenomena have naturalistic explanations resulting from psychological and physical factors which have sometimes given the impression of paranormal activity to some people  in fact  where there have been none  According to the psychologist Chris French   Whilst parapsychology has been said to be in decline  anomalistic psychology has been reported to be on the rise  It is now offered as an option on many psychology degree programmes and is also an option on the A2 psychology syllabus in the UK   4 8  Skeptics organizations  Organizations that encourage a critical examination of parapsychology and parapsychological research include the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry  publisher of the Skeptical Inquirer  the James Randi Educational Foundation  founded by illusionist and skeptic James Randi  and the Occult Investigative Committee of the Society of American Magicians a society for professional magicians that seeks  the promotion of harmony among magicians  and the opposition of the unnecessary public exposure of magical effects    5  See also  List of topics characterized as pseudoscience  6  References  7  Further reading  Alcock  James  1981   Parapsychology Science Or Magic   A
