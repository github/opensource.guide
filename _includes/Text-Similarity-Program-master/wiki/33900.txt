Vice Admiral of the Blue William Bligh  FRS  RN  9 September 1754 – 7 December 1817  was an officer of the British Royal Navy and a colonial administrator  A historic mutiny occurred during his command of HMS Bounty in 1789  Bligh and his loyal men made a remarkable voyage to Timor    after being set adrift in the Bounty s launch by the mutineers  Fifteen years after the Bounty mutiny  he was appointed Governor of New South Wales in Australia  with orders to clean up the corrupt rum trade of the New South Wales Corps  resulting in the so called Rum Rebellion   1  Early life  Bligh was born either in Tinten Manor in St Tudy near Bodmin  Cornwall  or in Plymouth to Francis Bligh and his wife Jane  Francis was Jane s second husband  she was the widow of a man whose surname was Pearce and her maiden name was Balsam  He was signed for the Royal Navy at age seven  it being common to sign on a  young gentleman  simply to gain experience at sea required for promotion  In 1770  at age 16  he joined HMS Hunter as an able seaman  the term used because there was no vacancy for a midshipman  He became a midshipman early in the following year  In September 1771  Bligh was transferred to the Crescent and remained in the ship for three years   In 1776  Bligh was selected by Captain James Cook for the position of sailing master of the Resolution and accompanied Cook in July 1776 on Cook s third and fatal voyage to the Pacific  Bligh returned to England at the end of 1780 and was able to give details of Cook s last voyage   Bligh married Elizabeth Betham  daughter of a Customs Collector  stationed in Douglas  Isle of Man   on 4 February 1781  The wedding took place at nearby Onchan  A few days later  he was appointed to serve in HMS Belle Poule as master  senior warrant officer responsible for navigation   Soon after this  in August 1781  he fought in the Battle of Dogger Bank under Admiral Parker  For the next 18 months  he was a lieutenant on various ships  He also fought with Lord Howe at Gibraltar in 1782   Between 1783 and 1787  Bligh was a captain in the merchant service  Like many lieutenants he would have found full pay employment in the Navy hard to obtain with the fleet largely demobilised at the end of the War of American Independence  In 1787  Bligh was selected as commander of the Bounty  He rose eventually to the rank of Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy   2  Naval career  William Bligh s naval career involved various appointments and assignments  He first rose to prominence as Master of HMS Resolution  under the command of Captain Cook  Bligh received praise from Cook during what would be the latter s final voyage  A summary follows   In the early 1780s  while in the merchant service  Bligh became acquainted with a young man named Fletcher Christian  who was eager to learn navigation from him  Bligh took Christian under his wing  and the two became friends   3  The voyage of the Bounty  3 1  The first breadfruit voyage  In 1787  Bligh took command of the Bounty  In order to win a premium offered by the Royal Society  he first sailed to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees  then set course for the Caribbean  where breadfruit was wanted for experiments to see whether it would be a successful food crop for slaves there  The Bounty never reached the Caribbean  as mutiny broke out on board shortly after the ship left Tahiti   The voyage to Tahiti was difficult  After trying unsuccessfully for a month to round Cape Horn  the Bounty was finally defeated by the notoriously stormy weather and forced to take the longer way around Africa  Cape Agulhas   That delay caused a further delay in Tahiti  as he had to wait five months for the breadfruit plants to mature sufficiently to be transported  The Bounty departed Tahiti in April 1789   3 2  The mutiny  Since it was rated only as a cutter  the Bounty had no officers other than Bligh  who was then only a lieutenant   a very small crew  and no Marines to provide protection from hostile natives during stops or to enforce security on board ship  To allow longer uninterrupted sleep  Bligh divided his crew into three watches instead of two  placing his protégé Fletcher Christianrated as a Master s Matein charge of one of the watches  The mutiny  which took place on 28 April 1789 during the return voyage  was led by Christian and supported by eighteen of the crew  They had seized firearms during Christian s night watch and surprised and bound Bligh in his cabin   Despite being in the majority  none of the loyalists put up a significant struggle once they saw Bligh bound  and the ship was taken over without bloodshed  The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen with a 23 foot  7 m  launch  so heavily loaded that the gunwales were only a few inches above the water   They were allowed four cutlasses  food and water for perhaps a week  a quadrant and a compass  but no charts  or Marine chronometer  Most of these were obtained by the clerk  Mr  Samuel  who acted with great calm and resolution  despite threats from the mutineers  The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members  so four were detained on the Bounty for their useful skills  they were later released at Tahiti   Tahiti was upwind from Bligh s initial position  and was the obvious destination of the mutineers  Many of the loyalists claimed to have heard the mutineers cry  Huzzah for Otaheite   as the Bounty pulled away  Timor was the nearest European outpost  3 618 miles away  Bligh and his crew first made for Tofua  only a few leagues distant  to obtain supplies  However  they were attacked by hostile natives and John Norton  a quartermaster  was killed  Fleeing from Tofua  Bligh did not dare to stop at the next islands  the Fiji islands   as he had no weapons for defence and expected hostile receptions  He did  however  make use of a small notebook to sketch a rough map of his discoveries   Bligh had confidence in his navigational skills  which he had perfected under the instruction of Captain Cook  His first responsibility was to bring his men to safety  Thus  he undertook the seemingly impossible voyage to Timor  the nearest European settlement  In this remarkable act of seamanship  Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47 day voyage  the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua  From 4 May until 29 May  when they reached the Great Barrier Reef  the 18 men lived on 1 12 of a pound of bread per day  The weather was often stormy  and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat s heavily laden condition  On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia  which they  appropriately  named Restoration Island  29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the British monarchy  Over the next week or more they island hopped north along the Great Barrier reef  while Bligh  cartographer as always  sketched maps of the coast  Early in June they passed through the Endeavour Strait and sailed again on the open sea until they reached Coupang  a settlement on Timor  on 15 June 1789  Several of the men who survived this ordeal with him soon died of sickness  possibly malaria  in the pestilential Dutch East Indies port of Batavia  the present day Indonesian capital of Jakarta  as they waited for transport to Britain   3 3  Possible causes of the Mutiny  To this day  the reasons behind the mutiny are a subject of debate  Many believe that Bligh was a cruel tyrant whose abuse of the crew led them to feel that they had no choice but to take over the ship  Others argue that the crew  inexperienced and unused to the rigours of the sea and  after having been exposed to freedom and sexual licence on Tahiti  refused to return to the  Jack Tar s  life of an ordinary seaman  They were led by Fletcher Christian in order to be free from Bligh s acid tongue  This view holds that the crew took the ship so they could return to comfort and ease on Tahiti   The mutiny is made more mysterious by the friendship of Christian and Bligh  which dates back to Bligh s days in the merchant service  Christian was well acquainted with the Bligh family  As Bligh was being set adrift he appealed to this friendship  saying  you have dandled my children upon your knee   According to Bligh  Christian  appeared disturbed  and replied   That  captain Bligh  that is the thing  I am in hell I am in hell    The Bounty s log shows that Bligh resorted to punishments relatively sparingly  He scolded when other captains would have whipped  and whipped when other captains would have hanged  He was an educated man  deeply interested in science  convinced that good diet and sanitation were necessary for the welfare of his crew  He took a great interest in his crew s exercise  was very careful about the quality of their food  and insisted upon the Bounty s being kept very clean  He tried  unsuccessfully  to check the spread of venereal disease among the men  J  C  Beaglehole has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer    Bligh made  dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make  he saw fools about him too easily     thin skinned vanity was his curse through life      Bligh  never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them   Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of HMS Pandora  who was sent on the Royal Navy s expedition to the South Pacific to find the mutineers and bring them to trial  Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed Bligh as being  Clearly that kind of portrayal should be regarded as a mere caricature  Indeed  the 14 men from the Bounty who were captured by Edwards  men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on the Pandora s quarterdeck  Yet  when the Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef  three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps  And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners  to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer s mate went into the cell to knock off the prisoners  irons  But before he could finish the job  the ship sank very quickly  Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking  More prisoners would likely have perished  had not William Moulter  a bosun s mate  unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel   3 4  Aftermath  In October 1790  Bligh was honourably acquitted at the court martial inquiring into the loss of the Bounty  Shortly thereafter  he published A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His Majesty s Ship  Bounty   And The Subsequent Voyage Of Part Of The Crew  In The Ship s Boat from Tofoa  One of the Friendly Islands  to Timor  a Dutch Settlement in the East Indies    Of the 10 surviving prisoners eventually brought home in spite of the Pandora s loss  four were acquitted  owing to Bligh s testimony that they were non mutineers that Bligh was obliged to leave on the Bounty because of lack of space in the launch  Two others were convicted because  while not participating in the mutiny  they were passive and did not resist  They subsequently received royal pardons  One was convicted but excused on a technicality  The remaining three were convicted and hanged    Comparative travels of the Bounty and the small boat after mutiny

Coupang  Dutch East Indies   circa June 1791  in which the first reference to events on the Bounty is made   My Dear  Dear Betsy  I am now  for the most part  in a part of the world I never expected  it is however a place that has afforded me relief and saved my life  and I have the happiness to assure you that I am now in perfect health      Know then my own Dear Betsy  that I have lost the Bounty     on the 28 April at day light in the morning Christian having the morning watch  He with several others came into my Cabin while I was a Sleep  and seizing me  holding naked Bayonets at my Breast  tied my Hands behind my back  and threatened instant destruction if I uttered a word  I however call d loudly for assistance  but the conspiracy was so well laid that the Officers Cabbin Doors were guarded by Centinels  so Nelson  Peckover  Samuels or the Master could not come to me  I was now dragged on Deck in my Shirt & closely guarded – I demanded of Christian the case of such a violent act  & severely degraded for his Villainy but he could only answer –  not a word sir or you are Dead   I dared him to the act & endeavoured to rally some one to a sense of their duty but to no effect      The Secrisy of this Mutiny is beyond all conception so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it  It is unbeknown to me why I must beguile such force  Even Mr  Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite  Tahiti  that he also turned Pirate  so that I have been run down by my own Dogs     My misfortune I trust will be properly considered by all the World – It was a circumstance I could not foresee – I had not sufficient Officers & had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened – I had not a Spirited & brave fellow about me & the Mutineers treated them as such  My conduct has been free of blame  & I showed everyone that  tied as I was  I defied every Villain to hurt me     I know how shocked you will be at this affair but I request of you My Dear Betsy to think nothing of it all is now past & we will again looked forward to future happyness  Nothing but true consciousness as an Officer that I have done well could support me    Give my blessings to my Dear Harriet  my Dear Mary  my Dear Betsy & to my Dear little stranger & tell them I shall soon be home   To You my Love I give all that an affectionate Husband can give –  Love  Respect & all that is or ever will be in the power of your ever affectionate Friend and Husband Wm Bligh   Strictly speaking  the crime of the mutineers  apart from the disciplinary crime of mutiny  was not piracy but barratry  the misappropriation  by those entrusted with its care  of a ship and or its contents to the detriment of the owner  in this case the British Crown    4  The second breadfruit voyage  After his exoneration by the court martial inquiry into the loss of the Bounty  Bligh remained in the Royal Navy  From 1791 to 1793  as master and commander of and in company with under the command of Nathaniel Portlock  he undertook again to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies  The operation was successful  and breadfruit is a popular food in Puerto Rico  the early slaves in West Indies islands not liking it  During this voyage Bligh also collected samples of the ackee fruit of Jamaica  introducing it to the Royal Society in Britain upon his return  The ackee s scientific name Blighia sapida in binomial nomenclature was given in honour of Bligh   5  Subsequent career and the Rum Rebellion  In February 1797  while Bligh was captain of   he surveyed the River Humber  preparing a map of the stretch from Spurn to the west of Sunk Island   In April–May  Bligh was one of the captains whose crews mutinied over  issues of pay and involuntary service for common seamen  during the Spithead mutiny  Despite receiving some of their demands at Spithead  disputes over navy life continued among the common sailors  Bligh was again one of the captains affected during the mutiny at the Royal Navy anchorage of Nore   Bligh became more directly involved in the Nore Mutiny   which  failed to achieve its goals of a fairer division of prize money and an end to brutality   It should be noted that these events were not triggered by any specific actions by Bligh as they  were widespread   and  involved a fair number of English ships   It was at this time that he learned  that his common nickname among men in the fleet was  that Bounty bastard     As captain of Director at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October  Bligh engaged three Dutch vessels  the Haarlem  the Alkmaar and the Vrijheid  While the Dutch suffered serious casualties  only seven seamen were wounded in Director  Director captured the Vrijehid and the Dutch commander Vice Admiral Jan de Winter   Bligh went on to serve under Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801  in command of   a 56 gun ship of the line  which was experimentally fitted exclusively with carronades  After the battle  Nelson personally praised Bligh for Bligh s contribution to the victory  He sailed Glatton safely between the banks while three other vessels ran aground  When Nelson pretended not to notice Admiral Parker s signal  43   stop the battle  and kept the signal  16  hoisted to continue the engagement  Bligh was the only captain in the squadron who could see that the two signals were in conflict  By choosing to fly Nelson s signal  he ensured that all the vessels behind him kept fighting   Bligh had gained the reputation of being a firm disciplinarian  Accordingly  he was offered the position of Governor of New South Wales on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks  President of the Royal Society and a main sponsor of the breadfruit expeditions  and appointed in March 1805  at £2 000 per annum  twice the pay of the retiring Governor Philip Gidley King  He arrived in Sydney on 6 August 1806  to become the fourth governor  During his time in Sydney  his confrontational administrative style provoked the wrath of a number of influential settlers and officials  They included the wealthy landowner and businessman John Macarthur and prominent Crown representatives such as the colony s principal surgeon  Thomas Jamison  and senior officers of the New South Wales Corps  Jamison and his military associates were defying government regulations by engaging in private trading ventures for profit  Bligh was determined to put a stop to this practice   The conflict between Bligh and the entrenched colonists culminated in another mutiny  the Rum Rebellion  when  on 26 January 1808  400 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston marched on Government House in Sydney to arrest Bligh  A petition written by John Macarthur and addressed to George Johnston was written the day of the arrest but most of the 151 signatures were gathered in the days after Bligh s overthrow  A rebel government was subsequently installed and Bligh  now deposed  made for Hobart in Tasmania aboard HMS Porpoise  Bligh failed to gain support from the authorities in Hobart to retake control of New South Wales  and remained effectively imprisoned on the Porpoise from 1808 until January 1810   Shortly after Bligh’s arrest  a watercolour illustrating the arrest by an unknown artist was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia’s first public art exhibition  The watercolour depicts a soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants’ beds in Government House and with two other figures standing by  The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin  This cartoon is Australia’s earliest surviving political cartoon and like all political cartoons it makes use of caricature and exaggeration to convey its message  The New South Wales Corps officers’ regarded themselves as gentlemen and in depicting Bligh as a coward  the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern   Of interest  however  was Bligh s concern for the more recently arrived settlers in the colony  who did not have the wealth and influence of Macarthur and Jamison  From the tombstones in Ebenezer and Richmond cemeteries  areas being settled west of Sydney during Bligh s tenure as governor   can be seen the number of boys born around 1807 to 1811 who were named  William Bligh XXXXX   family name    Bligh was eventually permitted to sail from Hobart  He arrived in Sydney on 17 January 1810 to collect evidence for the coming court martial in England of Major Johnston  He departed to attend the trial on 12 May 1810  arriving on 25 October 1810  The following year  the trial s presiding officers sentenced Johnston to be cashiered  a form of disgraceful dismissal that entailed surrendering his commission in the Royal Marines without compensation   This was a comparatively mild punishment which enabled Johnston to return  a free man  to New South Wales  where he could continue to enjoy the benefits of his accumulated private wealth   Bligh was court martialled twice again during his career  being acquitted both times   Soon after Johnston s trial had concluded  Bligh received a backdated promotion to rear admiral  In 1814 he was promoted again  to vice admiral of the blue  Significantly perhaps  he never again received an important command  though with the Napoleonic Wars almost over there would have been few fleet commands available  He did  however  design the North Bull Wall at the mouth of the River Liffey in Dublin  Its purpose was to clear a sandbar by Venturi action  As a result of its building  North Bull Island was formed by the sand cleared by the river s now more narrowly focused force  Bligh also charted and mapped Dublin Bay   6  Death  Bligh died in Bond Street  London on 7 December 1817 and was buried in a family plot at St  Mary s  Lambeth  this church is now the Garden Museum   His tomb  notable for its use of Lithodipyra  Coade stone   is topped by a breadfruit  A plaque marks Bligh s house  one block east of the Garden Museum at 100 Lambeth Road  near the Imperial War Museum   He was related to Admiral Sir Richard Rodney Bligh and Captain George Miller Bligh and his descendants include the former Premier of Queensland  Anna Bligh    7  In literature and film  Bligh is humorously portrayed in Sir Arthur Quiller Couch s short story  Frenchman s Creek  as a competent but irascible and tactless surveyor sent to a small fishing village Cornwall during the Napoleonic Wars  His accent and strong language being misunderstood by the locals as French  he is temporarily imprisoned as a spy   The situation in Sydney in 1810  with Bligh returning from Tasmania to be restored as Governor  is the setting of Naomi Novik s fantasy novel Tongues of Serpents  Harper Collins  2011    Bligh has been portrayed in film by the following actors   George Cross in The Mutiny of the Bounty  1916   Mayne Lynton in In the Wake of the Bounty  1933   Charles Laughton in Mutiny on the Bounty  1935   Trevor Howard in Mutiny on the Bounty  1962   Anthony Hopkins in The Bounty  1984   8  See also  European and American voyages of scientific exploration  9  References  10  Bibliography
