Whist is a classic English trick taking card game which was widely played in the 18th and 19th centuries  Although the rules are extremely simple  there is enormous scope for scientific play   1  History  Whist is a descendant of the 16th century game of trump or ruff  Whist replaced the popular variant of trump known as Ruff and Honours  The game takes its name from the 17th Century whist  or wist  meaning quiet  silent  attentive  which is the root of the modern wistful   According to Barrington  Whist was first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the Crown Coffee House in Bedford Row  London  around 1728  Edmond Hoyle  suspected to be a member of this group  began to tutor wealthy young gentlemen in the game and published A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist in 1742  It became the standard text and rules for the game for the next hundred years and led to the game becoming fashionable   In 1862 Henry Jones  writing under the pseudonym  Cavendish   published The Principles of Whist Stated and Explained  and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System  by Means of Hands Played Completely Through  which became the standard text  Many subsequent editions and enlargements of this work were published using the simpler title Cavendish On Whist  By this time Whist was governed by elaborate and rigid rules covering the laws of the game  etiquette and play which took time to study and master   In the 1890s  a variant known as Bridge Whist became popular which eventually evolved into Contract Bridge  The traditional game of Whist survives at social events called whist drives  There are many modern variants of Whist played for fun   2  Rules  A standard 52 card pack is used  The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest  A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2  Whist is played by four players  who play in two partnerships with the partners sitting opposite each other  Players cut or draw cards to determine partners  with the two highest playing against the lowest two  who have seating rights  The players then cut for deal  It is strictly against the rules to comment on the cards in any way  One may not comment upon the hand one was dealt nor about one s good fortune or bad fortune  One may not signal to one s partner   2 1  Shuffling and dealing  The cards can be shuffled by any player  though usually the player to dealer s left  The dealer has the right to shuffle last if he wishes  To speed up dealing a second pack can be shuffled by the dealer s partner during the deal and then placed to the right ready for the next hand  The cards are cut by the player on dealer s right before dealing  The dealer deals out all the cards  one at a time  face down  so that each player has thirteen cards  The final card  which belongs to the dealer  is turned face up to indicate which suit is trumps  The turned up trump card remains face up on the table until it is the dealer s turn to play to the first trick  The deal advances clockwise   2 2  Play  The player to the dealer s left leads to the first trick  He may lead any card in his hand  The other players  in clockwise order  each play a card to the trick and must follow suit by playing a card of the suit led if they have one  A player with no card of the suit led may play any card  either discarding or trumping  The trick is won by the highest card of the suit led  unless a trump is played  in which case the highest trump wins  The winner of the trick leads the next trick   Play continues until all thirteen tricks are played  at which point the score is recorded  If no team has enough points to win the game  another hand is played   Part of the skill involved in the game is one s ability to remember what cards have been played and reason out what cards remain  Therefore  once each trick is played  its cards are turned face down and kept in a stack of four near the player who won the trick  Before the next trick starts  a player may ask to review the cards from the last trick only  Once the lead card is played  however  no previously played cards can be reviewed by anyone   2 3  Scoring  After all tricks have been played  the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick won in excess of 6  When all four players are experienced  it is unusual for the score for a single hand to be higher than two  A game is over when one team reaches a score of five  There are so called  Hotel Rules  variations where other numbers are agreed to be played to in advance such as  American  and  Long   where the games are played to seven and nine respectively  The  Long  version is normally combined with  Honours    In longer variations of the game  those games where the winning score is not the standard 5 points  honours are points that are claimed at the end of each hand  Honours add nothing to the play of a hand  Honours serve only as an element of luck that speeds up games  and they are often omitted these days  Serious players disdain honours because it greatly increases the element of chance  A team that was dealt the top four cards  A K Q J  in the trump suit collect extra points  A team who holds three of the four honours between them claim 2 points  a team who holds all four honours between them claim 4 points  Tricks are scored before honours  Honours points can never be used for the last point of a game  Consider the following example  A game is being played to 9 points  The score is tied at 6  A hand is played and the winner of that hand took seven tricks and claimed honours  That team would receive 1 point for the 7th trick and only 1 point for honours  The score would then be 8 to 6   2 4  Basic technique  For the opening lead  it is best to lead your strongest suit  which is usually the longest  A singleton may also be a good lead  aiming at trumping in that suit  as one s partner should normally return the suit led   1st hand  It is usual to lead the king from a sequence of honours that includes it  including AK  the lead of an ace therefore denies the king    2nd hand usually plays low  especially with a single honour  However  it is often correct to split honours  play the lower of two touching honours  and to cover a J or 10 when holding Qx and cover a Q when holding the ace   3rd hand usually plays high  though play the lowest of touching honours  The finesse can be a useful technique  especially in trumps where honours cannot be trumped if they are not cashed   Discards are usually low cards of an unwanted suit  However  when the opponents are drawing trumps a suit preference signal is given by throwing a low card of one s strongest suit   3  Terminology  Deal  One card at a time is given to each player by the dealer starting with the player on the dealer’s left and proceeding clockwise until the deck is fully distributed  Dealer  The player who deals the cards for a hand  Deck  Standard playing card deck consisting of 52 cards in four suits  Dummy  In some variations of whist  a hand is turned face up and is played from by the player seated opposite  This allows for whist to be played by three players  Finesse  The play of a lower honour even though holding a higher one  hoping that the intermediate honour is held by a player who has already played to the trick  To give an example  you hold the ace and queen of hearts  Your right hand antagonist leads a heart  from which you infer that he holds the king of the same suit and wishes to draw the ace  in order to make his king  You however play the queen  and win the trick  still retaining your ace  ready to win again when he plays his king  Game  Reaching a total score agreed beforehand to be the score played up to  Grand Slam  The winning  by one team  of all thirteen tricks in a hand  Hand  Thirteen tricks   52 cards in the deck divided by four players equals thirteen cards per player   Honours  In some variations of whist  extra points are assigned after a game to a team if they were dealt the ace  king  queen  and jack  knave  of the trump suit  Lead  The first card played in a trick  Pack  See Deck  Rubber  The best of three games  Small slam  The winning  by one team  of twelve tricks in a hand  Tenace  A suit holding containing the highest and third highest of the suit or  the  minor tenace   second  and fourth highest  Trick  Four cards played one each by the players  Trump  The suit chosen by the last dealt card that will beat all other suits regardless of rank  When two cards are played from the trump suit  the higher card wins the trick   4  List
