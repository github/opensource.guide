Turkish     also referred to as Istanbul Turkish  is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages  with around 10–15 million native speakers in Southeastern Europe and 55–60 million native speakers in Western Asia  Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey  with smaller groups in Germany  Bulgaria  Macedonia  Northern Cyprus  Greece  the Caucasus  and other parts of Europe and Central Asia   The roots of the language can be traced to the Altay region in the Eurasian steppes  with the first known written records dating back nearly 1 300 years  To the west  the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded  In 1928  as one of Atatürk s Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey  the Ottoman script was replaced with a Latin alphabet   The distinctive characteristics of Turkish are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination  The basic word order of Turkish is subject–object–verb  Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender  Turkish has a strong T–V distinction and usage of honorifics  Turkish uses second person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of politeness  social distance  age  courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee  The plural second person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect   1  Classification  Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages  a subgroup of the Turkic language family  There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Turkish and the other Oghuz languages  including Azerbaijani  Turkmen  Qashqai  Gagauz  and Balkan Gagauz Turkish  The Turkic family comprises some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe  Central Asia  and Siberia  Some linguists believe the Turkic languages to be a part of a larger Altaic language family  About 40% of all speakers of Turkic languages are native Turkish speakers  The characteristic features of Turkish  such as vowel harmony  agglutination  and lack of grammatical gender  are universal within the Turkic family   2  History  The earliest known Turkic inscriptions are the three monumental Orkhon inscriptions found in modern Mongolia  Erected in honour of the prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khan  and dating back to some time between 732 and 735  as well as Bayn Tsokto inscriptions erected by Tonyukuk  the commander in chief between 720 and 725  they constitute important earliest records  After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the Orkhon Valley between 1889 and 1893  it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the Old Turkic language written using the Orkhon script  which has also been referred to as  Turkic runes  or  runiform  due to a superficial similarity to the Germanic runic alphabets   With the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages  c  6th–11th centuries   peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across Central Asia  covering a vast geographical region stretching from Siberia to Europe and the Mediterranean  The Seljuqs of the Oghuz Turks  in particular  brought their language  Oghuz Turkic—the direct ancestor of today s Turkish language—into Anatolia during the 11th century  Also during the 11th century  an early linguist of the Turkic languages  Mahmud al Kashgari from the Kara Khanid Khanate  published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the Compendium of the Turkic Dialects  Ottoman Turkish  Divânü Lügati t Türk    2 1  Ottoman Turkish  Following the adoption of Islam c  950 by the Kara Khanid Khanate and the Seljuq Turks  who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the Ottomans  the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from Arabic and Persian  Turkish literature during the Ottoman period  particularly Ottoman Divan poetry  was heavily influenced by Persian  including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words  The literary and official language during the Ottoman Empire period  c  1299–1922  is termed Ottoman Turkish  which was a mixture of Turkish  Persian  and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period s everyday Turkish known as kaba Türkçe or  rough Turkish   spoken by the less educated lower and also rural members of society  which contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language   2 2  Language reform and modern Turkish  After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey and the script reform  the Turkish Language Association  TDK  was established in 1932 under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk  with the aim of conducting research on Turkish  One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents  By banning the usage of imported words in the press  the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language  While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots  it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries   Owing to this sudden change in the language  older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies  While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin  the younger generations favor new expressions  It is considered particularly ironic that Atatürk himself  in his lengthy speech to the new Parliament in 1927  used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be  translated  three times into modern Turkish  first in 1963  again in 1986  and most recently in 1995   The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language  mostly from English  Many of these new words  particularly information technology terms  have received widespread acceptance  However  the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial  Some earlier changes—such as bölem to replace fırka   political party —also failed to meet with popular approval  fırka has been replaced by the French loanword parti   Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings  for example betik  originally meaning  book   is now used to mean  script  in computer science   Many of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts  This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning  For instance  dert  derived from the Persian dard  درد  pain    means  problem  or  trouble  in Turkish  whereas the native Turkish word ağrı is used for physical pain  Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word  creating a situation similar to the coexistence of Germanic and Romance words in English  Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are   3  Geographic distribution  Turkish is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey and by the Turkish diaspora in some 30 other countries  In particular  Turkish speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly  in whole or part  belonged to the Ottoman Empire  such as Bulgaria  Cyprus  Greece  primarily in Western Thrace   the Republic of Macedonia  Romania  and Serbia  More than two million Turkish speakers live in Germany  and there are significant Turkish speaking communities in the United States  France  The Netherlands  Austria  Belgium  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom  Due to the cultural assimilation of Turkish immigrants in host countries  not all ethnic Turkish immigrants speak the language with native fluency   In 2005  93% of the population of Turkey were native speakers of Turkish  about 67 million at the time  with Kurdish making up most of the remainder  However  most linguistic minorities in Turkey are bilingual  speaking Turkish with native like fluency   3 1  Official status  Turkish is the official language of Turkey and is one of the official languages of Cyprus  It also has official  but not primary  status in the Prizren District of Kosovo and three municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia  based on the concentration of Turkish speaking local population   In Turkey  the regulatory body for Turkish is the Turkish Language Association  Türk Dil Kurumu or TDK   which was founded in 1932 under the name Türk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti   Society for Research on the Turkish Language    The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the ideology of linguistic purism  indeed one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin  These changes  together with the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet in 1928  shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today  TDK became an independent body in 1951  with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education  This status continued until August 1983  when it was again made into a governmental body in the constitution of 1982  following the military coup d état of 1980   3 2  Dialects  Modern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul  Dialectal variation persists  in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s  Academically  researchers from Turkey often refer to Turkish dialects as ağız or şive  leading to an ambiguity with the linguistic concept of accent  which is also covered with these words  Projects investigating Turkish dialects are being carried out by several universities  as well as a dedicated work group of the Turkish Language Association  Work is currently in progress for the compilation and publication of their research as a comprehensive dialect atlas of the Turkish language   Rumelice is spoken by immigrants from Rumelia  and includes the distinct dialects of Deliorman  Dinler  and Adakale  which are influenced by the theoretized Balkan language area  Kıbrıs Türkçesi is the name for Cypriot Turkish and is spoken by the Turkish Cypriots  Edirne is the dialect of Edirne  Ege is spoken in the Aegean region  with its usage extending to Antalya  The nomadic Yörük tribes of the Mediterranean Region of Turkey also have their own dialect of Turkish  This group is not to be confused with the Yuruk nomads of Macedonia  Greece  and European Turkey who speak Balkan Gagauz Turkish   Güneydoğu is spoken in the southeast  to the east of Mersin  Doğu  a dialect in Eastern Anatolia  has a dialect continuum  The Meskhetian Turks who live in Kazakhstan  Azerbaijan and Russia as well as in several Central Asian countries  also speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish  originating in the areas of Kars  Ardahan  and Artvin and sharing similarities with Azeri  the language of Azerbaijan   The Central Anatolia region speaks Orta Anadolu  Karadeniz  spoken in the Eastern Black Sea Region and represented primarily by the Trabzon dialect  exhibits substratum influence from Greek in phonology and syntax  it is also known as Laz dialect  not to be confused with the Laz language   Kastamonu is spoken in Kastamonu and its surrounding areas  Karamanlıca is spoken in Greece  where it is also named Kαραμανλήδικα  Karamanlidika   It is the literary standard for Karamanlides   4  Phonology  4 1  Consonants  The phoneme which is usually referred to as yumuşak g   soft g    and written in Turkish orthography  represents a vowel sequence or a rather weak bilabial approximant between rounded vowels  a weak palatal approximant between unrounded front vowels  and a vowel sequence elsewhere  It never occurs at the beginning of a word or a syllable  but always follows a vowel  When word final or preceding another consonant  it lengthens the preceding vowel   In native Turkic words  the sounds     and are in complementary distribution with     and   the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels  The distribution of these phonemes is often unpredictable  however  in foreign borrowings and proper nouns  In such words      and often occur with back vowels  some examples are given below   4 1 1  Consonant devoicing  Turkish orthography reflects final obstruent devoicing  whereby a voiced obstruent  such as   is devoiced to at the end of a word or before a consonant  but retains its voicing before a vowel  In loan words  the voiced partner of  k  is   g    in native words  it is   ğ     This is analogous to languages such as German and Russian  but in the case of Turkish  the spelling is usually made to match the sound  However  in a few cases  such as ad  name   dative ada   the underlying form is retained in the spelling  cf  at  horse   dative ata   Other exceptions are od  fire  vs  ot  herb   sac  sheet metal   saç  hair   Most loanwords  such as kitap above  are spelled as pronounced  but a few such as hac  hajj   şad  happy   and yad  strange r   also show their underlying forms   Native nouns of two or more syllables that end in  k  in dictionary form are nearly all   ğ   in underlying form  However  most verbs and monosyllabic nouns are underlyingly   k     4 2  Vowels  The vowels of the Turkish language are  in their alphabetical order                  The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being three dimensional  where vowels are characterised by three features  front and back  rounded and unrounded and vowel height  In fact  the vowel   being the fronted version of   is often pronounced     just like Azerbaijani     The only diphthongs in the language are falling diphthongs usually analyzed as a sequence of  j  and a vowel   4 2 1  Vowel harmony  Vowel harmony is the principle by which a native Turkish word incorporates either exclusively back vowels  a  ı  o  and u  or exclusively front vowels  e  i  ö  and ü   The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above   Grammatical affixes have  a chameleon like quality   and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony   twofold   e  a   the locative suffix  for example  is  de after front vowels and  da after back vowels  The notation  de² is a convenient shorthand for this pattern   fourfold   i  ı  ü  u   the genitive suffix  for example  is  in or  ın after unrounded vowels  front or back respectively   and  ün or  un after the corresponding rounded vowels  In this case  the shorthand notation  in4 is used  The following examples  based on the copula  dir4    it  is    illustrate the principles of vowel harmony in practice  Türkiye dir   it is Turkey    kapıdır   it is the door    but gündür   it is the day    paltodur   it is the coat     There are some exceptions to the rules of vowel harmony  In compound words  the vowels need not harmonize between the constituent words of the compound  Forms like bu+gün   today   or baş+kent   capital   are permissible  In addition  vowel harmony does not apply in loanwords and some invariant affixes  such as  yor  present tense  and  bil   potential   Some loanwords do  however  exhibit partial or even complete vowel harmony  e g  mümkün  possible    Arabic mumkin  and dürbün  binoculars    Persian dūrbīn   There are also a few native Turkish words that do not follow the rule  such as anne   mother    In such words  suffixes harmonize with the final vowel  thus annedir   she is a mother    Many loanwords from Arabic and French  however  take front vowel suffixes after final back vowels  for example halsiz   hal +  siz4  listless   meçhuldür   meçhul +  dir4  it is unknown   harfler   harf +  ler²   alphabetical  letters   instead of the expected *halsız  *meçhuldur and *harflar    The road sign in the photograph above illustrates several of these features   a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony  Orta+köy   middle village —a place name   a loanword also violating vowel harmony  viyadük    French viaduc  viaduct    the possessive suffix  i4 harmonizing with the final vowel  and softening the k by consonant alternation   viyadüğü  4 3  Stress  Stress is usually on the last syllable  Exceptions include some suffix combinations and loanwords  particularly from Italian and Greek  as well as interjections  adverbs  and many proper names  While the aforementioned loanwords are usually stressed on the penultimate syllable   lokanta  restaurant  or iskele  quay    the stress of proper names is less predictable   İstanbul  Ankara    5  Grammar  Turkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes  and specifically suffixes  or endings  One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words  such as creating a verb from a noun  or a noun from a verbal root  see the section on Word formation   Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word  The only native prefixes are alliterative intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs  for example sımsıcak   boiling hot    sıcak  and masmavi   bright blue    mavi    The extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words  e g  Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınız  meaning  You are said to be one of those that we couldn t manage to convert to a Czechoslovak   While this case is contrived  long words frequently occur in normal Turkish  as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column  Bayramlaşamadıklarımız  Bayram  festival  Recipr Impot Partic Plur PossPl1   Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season s greetings    Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide  İmlâ Kılavuzu   Dilde birlik  ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir   Unity in language is among the indispensables  dispense Pass Impot Plur PossS3 Abl Copula  of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a sine qua non of national unity     5 1  Nouns  There is no definite article in Turkish  but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used  see below   Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings  as in Latin  There are six noun cases in Turkish  with all the endings following vowel harmony  shown in the table using the shorthand superscript notation  The plural marker  ler² immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes  e g  köylerin  of the villages     The accusative case marker is used only for definite objects  compare  bir  ağaç gördük  we saw a tree  with ağacı gördük  we saw the tree   The plural marker  ler² is generally not used when a class or category is meant  ağaç gördük can equally well mean  we saw trees  as we walked through the forest  —as opposed to ağaçları gördük  we saw the trees  in question     The declension of ağaç illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology  consonant assimilation in suffixes  ağaçtan  ağaçta  and voicing of final consonants before vowels  ağacın  ağaca  ağacı    Additionally  nouns can take suffixes that assign person  for example  imiz4   our   With the addition of the copula  for example  im4   I am   complete sentences can be formed  The interrogative particle mi4 immediately follows the word being questioned  köye mi    going  to the village    ağaç mı    is it a  tree     5 2  Personal pronouns  The Turkish personal pronouns in the nominative case are ben  1s   sen  2s   o  3s   biz  1pl   siz  2pl  or formal polite 2s   and onlar  3pl   They are declined regularly with some exceptions  benim  1s gen    bizim  1pl gen    bana  1s dat    sana  2s dat    and the oblique forms of o use the root on  All other pronouns  reflexive kendi and so on  are declined regularly   5 2 1  Noun phrases  tamlama   Two nouns  or groups of nouns  may be joined in either of two ways   definite  possessive  compound  belirtili tamlama   E g  Türkiye nin sesi  the voice of Turkey  radio station    the voice belonging to Turkey  Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending  in4 added to the first noun  the second noun has the third person suffix of possession   s i4   indefinite  qualifying  compound  belirtisiz tamlama   E g  Türkiye Cumhuriyeti  Turkey Republic   the Republic of Turkey   not the republic belonging to Turkey  but the Republic that is Turkey  Here the first noun has no ending  but the second noun has the ending   s i4—the same as in definite compounds  The following table illustrates these principles  In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds  for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with  square brackets   The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined  Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix  because it is a compound by itself   no further suffix is added   As the last example shows  the qualifying expression may be a substantival sentence rather than a noun or noun group   There is a third way of linking the nouns where both nouns take no suffixes  takısız tamlama   However  in this case the first noun acts as an adjective  e g  Demir kapı  iron gate   elma yanak   apple cheek   i e  red cheek   kömür göz   coal eye   i e  black eye     5 3  Adjectives  Turkish adjectives are not declined  However most adjectives can also be used as nouns  in which case they are declined  e g  güzel   beautiful   → güzeller    the  beautiful ones   people    Used attributively  adjectives precede the nouns they modify  The adjectives var   existent   and yok   non existent   are used in many cases where English would use  there is  or  have   e g  süt yok   there is no milk   lit    the  milk  is  non existent    the construction  noun 1 GEN noun 2 POSS var yok  can be translated  noun 1 has doesn t have noun 2   imparatorun elbisesi yok  the emperor has no clothes     the  emperor of clothes his non existent    kedimin ayakkabıları yoktu   my cat had no shoes   lit   cat my of shoe plur  its non existent past tense     5 4  Verbs  Turkish verbs indicate person  They can be made negative  potential   can    or impotential   cannot    Furthermore  Turkish verbs show tense  present  past  future  and aorist   mood  conditional  imperative  inferential  necessitative  and optative   and aspect  Negation is expressed by the infix  me²  immediately following the stem   Almost all Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way  most notable exception being the irregular and defective verb i   the Turkish copula  corresponding to English to be   which can be used in compound forms  the shortened form is called an enclitic   Gelememişti   Gelememiş idi   Gelememiş + i  +  di   5 5  Verb tenses  There are 9 simple and 20 compound tenses in Turkish  9 simple tenses are simple past  di li geçmiş   inferential past  miş li geçmiş   present continuous  simple present  aorist   future  wish  demand  necessitative   must   and order  There are three groups of compound forms  Story  hikaye  is the witnessed past of the above forms  except command   rumor  rivayet  is the unwitnessed past of the above forms  except inferential past and command   conditional wish  koşul  is the conditional form of the first five basic tenses  In the example below the second person singular of the verb git   go   is shown   There are also so called combined verbs  which are created by adding certain verbs  like bil or ver  to the stem of the verb  Bil is the sufficiency mood  It is the equivalent of English auxiliary verbs  able to    can  or  may   Ver is the swiftness  kal is the perpetuity and yaz is the approach   almost   moods  Thus while gittin is  you went   gidebildin is  you could go  and gidiverdin is  you went swiftly   The tenses of the combined verbs are the same as the other verbs   5 5 1  Attributive verbs  participles   Turkish verbs have attributive forms  including present  with the ending  en²   future   ecek²   indirect inferential past   miş4   and aorist   er² or  ir4   These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns  oynamayan çocuklar  children who do not play   oynamayanlar  those who do not play   okur yazar  reader writer   literate   okur yazarlar  literates    The most important function of attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the relative clauses found in most European languages  The attributive forms used in these constructions are the future   ecek²  and an older form   dik4   which covers both present and past meanings  The use of these  personal or relative participles  is illustrated in the following table  in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause   5 6  Word order  Word order in simple Turkish sentences is generally subject–object–verb  as in Korean and Latin  but unlike English  In more complex sentences  the basic rule is that the qualifier precedes the qualified  this principle includes  as an important special case  the participial modifiers discussed above  The definite precedes the indefinite  thus çocuğa hikâyeyi anlattı  she told the child the story   but hikâyeyi bir çocuğa anlattı  she told the story to a child    It is possible to alter the word order to stress the importance of a certain word or phrase  The main rule is that the word before the verb has the stress without exception  For example  if one wants to say  Hakan went to school  with a stress on the word  school   okul  the indirect object  it would be  Hakan okula gitti   If the stress is to be placed on  Hakan   the subject   it would be  Okula Hakan gitti  which means  it s Hakan who went to school    6  Vocabulary  Latest 2010 edition of Büyük Türkçe Sözlük  Great Turkish Dictionary   the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association  contains 616 767 words  expressions  terms and nouns   The 2005 edition of Güncel Türkçe Sözlük  the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association  contains 104 481 words  of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin  Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Arabic  French  Persian  Italian  English  and Greek   6 1  Word formation  Turkish extensively uses agglutination to form new words from nouns and verbal stems  The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary   An example set of words derived from a substantive root   Another example  starting from a verbal root   New words are also frequently formed by compounding two existing words into a new one  as in German  A few examples of compound words are given below   7  Writing system  Turkish is written using a Latin alphabet introduced in 1928 by Atatürk to replace the Ottoman Turkish alphabet  a version of Perso Arabic alphabet  The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels—long ā  ū and ī—and included several redundant consonants  such as variants of z  which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish   The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish  which has eight vowels   The reform of the script was an important step in the cultural reforms of the period  The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Language Commission composed of prominent linguists  academics  and writers  The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country  cooperation with publishing companies  and encouragement by Atatürk himself  who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public  As a result  there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels   The Latin alphabet was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th century reform  Instances include a 1635 Latin Albanian dictionary by Frang Bardhi  who also incorporated several sayings in the Turkish language  as an appendix to his work  e g  alma agatsdan irak duschamas –  An apple does not fall far from its tree     Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language  the spelling is largely phonemic  with one letter corresponding to each phoneme  Most of the letters are used approximately as in English  the main exceptions being   which denotes   being used for the found in Persian and European loans   and the undotted   representing   As in German  and represent and   The letter   in principle  denotes but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel  The letters and represent and   respectively  A circumflex is written over back vowels following     or when these consonants represent     and —almost exclusively in Arabic and Persian loans  An apostrophe is used to separate proper nouns from inflectional suffixes  e g   in Istanbul   but not from derivational suffixes  e g   from of Istanbul     The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters  q  x  w omitted and ç  ş  ğ  ı  ö  ü added  The complete list is   The
