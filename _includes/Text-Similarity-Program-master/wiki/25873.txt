A relational database is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational model of data  as proposed by E F  Codd in 1970  This model organizes data into one or more tables  or  relations   of rows and columns  with a unique key for each row  Generally  each entity type described in a database has its own table  the rows representing instances of that entity and the columns representing the attribute values describing each instance  Because each row in a table has its own unique key  rows in other tables that are related to it can be linked to it by storing the original row s unique key as an attribute of the secondary row  where it is known as a  foreign key    Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented using this simple set of concepts   Prior to the advent of this model  databases were usually hierarchical  and each tended to be organized with a unique mix of indexes  chains  and pointers  The simplicity of the relational model led to its soon becoming the predominant type of database   The various software systems used to maintain relational databases are known as Relational Database Management Systems  RDBMS    Virtually all relational database systems use SQL  Structured Query Language  as the language for querying and maintaining the database   1  Overview  Each database is a collection of related tables  these are also called relations  hence the name  relational database   Each table is a physical representation of an entity or object that is in a tabular format consisting of columns and rows  Columns are the fields of a record or the attributes of an entity  The rows contain the values or data instances  these are also called records or tuples   Relationships exist both among the columns within a table and among the tables  These relationships take three logical forms  one to one  one to many  or many to many  Most relational databases are designed so there is only one value per cell  an intersection of a column and row   in this design pattern  there are only one to one relationships within a table  Each table is named according to the data it contains  such as people or addresses   In order for a DBMS to operate efficiently and accurately  it must have ACID transactions  Part of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table  Therefore  most physical implementations have a system assigned  unique primary key for each table  When a new row is written to the table  the system generates and writes the new  unique value for the primary key  PK   this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table  System performance is optimized for PKs  Other  more natural keys may also be identified and defined as alternate keys  AK   Often several columns may be needed to form an AK  this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK   Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify one row within a table  Additional technology may be applied that will significantly assure a unique ID across the world  a globally unique identifier  these are used when there are broader system requirements   The primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables  When a PK migrates to another table  it becomes a foreign key in the other table  When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table  this design pattern can represent either a one to one  or a one to many relationship  Most relational database designs resolve many to many relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables—the relationship becomes an entity  the resolution table is then named appropriately and is often assigned its own PK while the two FKs are combined to form an AK  The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system assigned integers are used normally as PKs  there usually is neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns   Most of the programming within a RDBMS is accomplished using stored procedures  SPs   Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system  For increased security  the system design may also grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables  Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new data and update existing data  More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data   2  Terminology  The relational database was first defined in June 1970 by Edgar Codd  of IBM s San Jose Research Laboratory  Codd s view of what qualifies as an RDBMS is summarized in Codd s 12 rules  A relational database has become the predominant choice in storing data  Other models besides the relational model include the hierarchical database model and the network model   The table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and their SQL equivalents   3  Relations or tables  A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes  A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object  Objects are typically physical objects or concepts  A relation is usually described as a table  which is organized into rows and columns  All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints   The relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples  in turn  impose no order on the attributes  Applications access data by specifying queries  which use operations such as select to identify tuples  project to identify attributes  and join to combine relations  Relations can be modified using the insert  delete  and update operators  New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query  Similarly  queries identify tuples for updating or deleting   Tuples by definition are unique  If the tuple contains a candidate or primary key then obviously it is unique  however  a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple  The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique  but does not require a primary key to be defined  Because a tuple is unique  its attributes by definition constitute a superkey   4  Base and derived relations  In a relational database  all data are stored and accessed via relations  Relations that store data are called  base relations   and in implementations are called  tables   Other relations do not store data  but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations  These relations are sometimes called  derived relations   In implementations these are called  views  or  queries   Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation  even though they may grab information from several relations  Also  derived relations can be used as an abstraction layer   4 1  Domain  A domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute  and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute  Mathematically  attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set  The character string  ABC   for instance  is not in the integer domain  but the integer value 123 is   5  Constraints  Constraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute  For instance  a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10  Constraints provide one method of implementing business rules in the database  SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of check constraints  Constraints restrict the data that can be stored in relations  These are usually defined using expressions that result in a boolean value  indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint  Constraints can apply to single attributes  to a tuple  restricting combinations of attributes  or to an entire relation  Since every attribute has an associated domain  there are constraints  domain constraints   The two principal rules for the relational model are known as entity integrity and referential integrity   5 1  Primary key  A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table  In order for an attribute to be a good primary key it must not repeat  While natural attributes  attributes used to describe the data being entered  are sometimes good primary keys  surrogate keys are often used instead  A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it  for instance  in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them   The surrogate key has no intrinsic  inherent  meaning  but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple  Another common occurrence  especially in regard to N M cardinality is the composite key  A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that  together  uniquely identify a record   For example  in a database relating students  teachers  and classes  Classes could be uniquely identified by a composite key of their room number and time slot  since no other class could have exactly the same combination of attributes  In fact  use of a composite key such as this can be a form of data verification  albeit a weak one   5 2  Foreign key  A foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table  The foreign key can be used to cross reference tables  Foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation  Foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation  A foreign key could be described formally as   For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes  there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes    5 3  Stored procedures  A stored procedure is executable code that is associated with  and generally stored in  the database  Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations  like inserting a tuple into a relation  gathering statistical information about usage patterns  or encapsulating complex business logic and calculations  Frequently they are used as an application programming interface  API  for security or simplicity  Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMSs often allow developers to take advantage of procedural extensions  often vendor specific  to the standard declarative SQL syntax  Stored procedures are not part of the relational database model  but all commercial implementations include them   5 4  Index  An index is one way of providing quicker access to data  Indices can be created on any combination of attributes on a relation  Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the index  without having to check each tuple in turn  This is analogous to using the index of a book to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found  so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for  Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques  each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution  relation size  and typical access pattern  Indices are usually implemented via B+ trees  R trees  and bitmaps  Indices are usually not considered part of the database  as they are considered an implementation detail  though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database  It should be noted that use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance  This is because B tree indexes result in query times proportional to log n  where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries  no size dependency so long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory    6  Relational operations  Queries made against the relational database  and the derived relvars in the database are expressed in a relational calculus or a relational algebra  In his original relational algebra  Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each  The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical set operations   The union operator combines the tuples of two relations and removes all duplicate tuples from the result  The relational union operator is equivalent to the SQL UNION operator   The intersection operator produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common  Intersection is implemented in SQL in the form of the INTERSECT operator   The difference operator acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation  Difference is implemented in SQL in the form of the EXCEPT or MINUS operator   The cartesian product of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria  resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation  The cartesian product is implemented in SQL as the CROSS JOIN operator  The remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases   The selection  or restriction  operation retrieves tuples from a relation  limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criterion  i e  a subset in terms of set theory  The SQL equivalent of selection is the SELECT query statement with a WHERE clause   The projection operation extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples   The join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join  In this type of join  two relations are connected by their common attributes  MySQL s approximation of a natural join is the INNER JOIN operator  In SQL  an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query  For each table added to a SQL Query  one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product  Thus  for N tables in a SQL query  there must be N 1 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product   The relational division operation is a slightly more complex operation  which involves essentially using the tuples of one relation  the dividend  to partition a second relation  the divisor   The relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator  hence the name   Other operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd s introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data  among others   7  Normalization  Normalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model  It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate nonsimple domains  non atomic values  and the redundancy  duplication  of data  which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity  The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the normal forms   8  References
