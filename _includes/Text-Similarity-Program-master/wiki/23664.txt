Papyrus is a thin paper like material made from the pith of the papyrus plant  Cyperus papyrus  a wetland sedge that was once abundant in the Sudd of Southern Sudan along with the Nile Delta of Egypt  Papyrus is first known to have been used in ancient Egypt  at least as far back as the First Dynasty   but it was also used throughout the Mediterranean region and in Kingdom of Kush  Ancient Egyptians are thought to have used papyrus as a writing material  as well as employing it commonly in the construction of other artifacts such as reed boats  mats  rope  sandals  and baskets   1  History  Papyrus was first manufactured in Egypt and Southern Sudan as far back as the fourth millennium BCE  The earliest archaeological evidence of papyrus was excavated in 2012 2013 at Wadi al Jarf  an ancient Egyptian harbor located on the Red Sea coast  These documents date from ca  2560–2550 BCE  end of the reign of Khufu   In the first centuries BCE and CE  papyrus scrolls gained a rival as a writing surface in the form of parchment  which was prepared from animal skins  Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which book form codices were fashioned  Early Christian writers soon adopted the codex form  and in the Græco Roman world  it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices   Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll  as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll  or scroll  was required to create large volume texts  Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce  but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness  Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality  the writing surface was irregular  and the range of media that could be used was also limited   Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper  locally produced products parchment and vellum  of significantly higher durability in moist climates  though Henri Pirenne s connection of its disappearance with the Muslim overrunning of Egypt is contended  Its last appearance in the Merovingian chancery is with a document of 692  though it was known in Gaul until the middle of the following century  The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree  typically conservative  all papal bulls were on papyrus until 1022   under Pope Victor II  and 1087 for an Arabic document  Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive paper introduced by Arabs  By the 12th century  parchment and paper were in use in the Byzantine Empire  but papyrus was still an option   Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices  these are listed  with minor differences  both by Pliny and Isidore of Seville   Until the middle of the 19th century  only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known  They did not contain literary works  The first discovery of papyri rolls in modern days was made at Herculaneum in 1752  Before that date  the only papyri known were a few surviving from medieval times   2  Etymology  The English word  papyrus  derives  via Latin  from Greek πάπυρος  papuros   a loanword of unknown  perhaps Pre Greek  origin  Greek has a second word for it  βύβλος  bublos  said to derive from the name of the Phoenician city of Byblos   The Greek writer Theophrastus  who flourished during the 4th century BC  uses papuros when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and bublos for the same plant when used for nonfood products  such as cordage  basketry  or writing surfaces  The more specific term βίβλος biblos  which finds its way into English in such words as  bibliography    bibliophile   and  bible   refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant  Papyrus is also the etymon of  paper   a similar substance   In the Egyptian language  papyrus was known by the terms wadj  w3ḏ   tjufy  ṯwfy   and djet  ḏt    3  Documents written on papyrus  The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it  often rolled up into scrolls  The plural for such documents is papyri  Historical papyri are given identifying names—generally the name of the discoverer  first owner or institution where they are kept—and numbered  such as  Papyrus Harris I   Often an abbreviated form is used  such as  pHarris I   These documents provide important information on ancient writings  they give us the only extant copy of Menander  the Egyptian Book of the Dead  Egyptian treatises on medicine  the Ebers Papyrus  and on surgery  the Edwin Smith papyrus   Egyptian mathematical treatises  the Rhind papyrus   and Egyptian folk tales  the Westcar papyrus   When  in the 18th century  a library of ancient papyri was found in Herculaneum  ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time  However  since these papyri were badly charred  their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today   4  Manufacture and use  Papyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant  Cyperus papyrus  The outer rind is first removed  and the sticky fibrous inner pith is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about long  The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping  and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle  The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for decomposition to begin  perhaps increasing adhesion  but this is not certain  The two layers possibly were glued together  While still moist  the two layers are hammered together  mashing the layers into a single sheet  The sheet is then dried under pressure  After drying  the sheet is polished with some rounded object  possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood   Sheets could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll  A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll  making it easier to handle  To form the long strip scrolls required  a number of such sheets were united  placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll s length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other  Normally  texts were first written on the recto  the lines following the fibres  parallel to the long edges of the scroll  Secondarily  papyrus was often reused  writing across the fibres on the verso  Pliny the Elder describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his Naturalis Historia   In a dry climate  like that of Egypt  papyrus is stable  formed as it is of highly rot resistant cellulose  but storage in humid conditions can result in molds attacking and destroying the material  Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues  Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author  and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll  In European conditions  papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades  a 200 year old papyrus was considered extraordinary  Imported papyrus once commonplace in Greece and Italy has since deteriorated beyond repair  but papyrus is still being found in Egypt  extraordinary examples include the Elephantine papyri and the famous finds at Oxyrhynchus and Nag Hammadi  The Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum  containing the library of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus  Julius Caesar s father in law  was preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius  but has only been partially excavated   Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid 18th century  Scottish explorer James Bruce experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the Sudan  for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt  Also in the 18th century  Sicilian Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at Syracuse  where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild  During the 1920s  when Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn lived in Maadi  outside Cairo  he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus  growing the plant in his garden  He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen  and produced successful examples of papyrus  one of which was exhibited in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo  The modern technique of papyrus production used in Egypt for the tourist trade was developed in 1962 by the Egyptian engineer Hassan Ragab using plants that had been reintroduced into Egypt in 1872 from France  Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production   Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps  to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods  Particularly in East and Central Africa  people harvest papyrus  which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally  Examples include baskets  hats  fish traps  trays or winnowing mats and floor mats  Papyrus is also used to make roofs  ceilings  rope and fences  Although alternatives  such as eucalyptus  are increasingly available  papyrus is still used as fuel   5  Collections of papyri  Amherst Papyri  This is a collection of William Tyssen Amherst  1st Baron Amherst of Hackney  It includes biblical
