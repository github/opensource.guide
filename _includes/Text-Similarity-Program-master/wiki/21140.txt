The noble gases make a group of chemical elements with similar properties  under standard conditions  they are all odorless  colorless  monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity  The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium  He   neon  Ne   argon  Ar   krypton  Kr   xenon  Xe   and the radioactive radon  Rn    For the first six periods of the periodic table  the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18 of the periodic table  It is possible that due to relativistic effects  the group 14 element flerovium exhibits some noble gas like properties  instead of the group 18 element ununoctium  Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions  The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted  For example  argon is used in lightbulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing  also  helium is breathed by deep sea divers to prevent oxygen and nitrogen toxicity   The properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure  their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be  full   giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions  and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds  The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together  differing by less than   that is  they are liquids over only a small temperature range   Neon  argon  krypton  and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation  Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas  using cryogenic gas separation techniques  and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium compounds  Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting  welding  and space exploration  A helium oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep sea divers at depths of seawater over to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia  the lethal effect of high pressure oxygen  and nitrogen narcosis  the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial pressure threshold  After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent  it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons   1  History  Noble gas is translated from the German noun   first used in 1898 by Hugo Erdmann to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity  The name makes an analogy to the term  noble metals   which also have low reactivity  The noble gases have also been referred to as inert gases  but this label is deprecated as many noble gas compounds are now known  Rare gases is another term that was used  but this is also inaccurate because argon forms a fairly considerable part  0 94% by volume  1 3% by mass  of the Earth s atmosphere   Pierre Janssen and Joseph Norman Lockyer discovered a new element on August 18  1868 while looking at the chromosphere of the Sun  and named it helium after the Greek word for the Sun    or    No chemical analysis was possible at the time  but helium was later found to be a noble gas  Before them  in 1784  the English chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than nitrogen  A century later  in 1895  Lord Rayleigh discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions  Along with Scottish scientist William Ramsay at University College  London  Lord Rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas  leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element  argon  from the Greek word     inactive    With this discovery  they realized an entire class of gases was missing from the periodic table  During his search for argon  Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating cleveite  a mineral  In 1902  having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and argon  Dmitri Mendeleev included these noble gases as group 0 in his arrangement of the elements  which would later become the periodic table   Ramsay continued to search for these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate liquid air into several components  In 1898  he discovered the elements krypton  neon  and xenon  and named them after the Greek words     hidden        new    and     stranger    respectively  Radon was first identified in 1898 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn  and was named radium emanation  but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics were found to be similar to those of other noble gases  Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry  respectively  for their discovery of the noble gases  in the words of J  E  Cederblom  then president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences   the discovery of an entirely new group of elements  of which no single representative had been known with any certainty  is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry  being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance    The discovery of the noble gases aided in the development of a general understanding of atomic structure  In 1895  French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine  the most electronegative element  and argon  one of the noble gases  but failed  Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century  but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure  Learning from these experiments  Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus  and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons  In 1916  Gilbert N  Lewis formulated the octet rule  which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom  this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell   In 1962 Neil Bartlett discovered the first chemical compound of a noble gas  xenon hexafluoroplatinate  Compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after  in 1962 for radon  radon difluoride  and in 1963 for krypton  krypton difluoride     The first stable compound of argon was reported in 2000 when argon fluorohydride  HArF  was formed at a temperature of    In December 1998  scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research working in Dubna  Russia bombarded plutonium  Pu  with calcium  Ca  to produce a single atom of element 114  flerovium  Fl   Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element may be the first superheavy element to show abnormal noble gas like properties  even though it is a member of group 14 on the periodic table  In October 2006  scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully created synthetically ununoctium  Uuo   the seventh element in group 18  by bombarding californium  Cf  with calcium  Ca    2  Physical and atomic properties  For more data  see Noble gas  data page    The noble gases have weak interatomic force  and consequently have very low melting and boiling points  They are all monatomic gases under standard conditions  including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid elements  Helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements  its boiling and melting points are lower than those of any other known substance  it is the only element known to exhibit superfluidity  it is the only element that cannot be solidified by cooling under standard conditions—a pressure of must be applied at a temperature of to convert it to a solid  The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable isotopes  Radon has no stable isotopes  its longest lived isotope  222Rn  has a half life of 3 8 days and decays to form helium and polonium  which ultimately decays to lead   The noble gas atoms  like atoms in most groups  increase steadily in atomic radius from one period to the next due to the increasing number of electrons  The size of the atom is related to several properties  For example  the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom  Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period  which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity  Some of the heavier noble gases  however  have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules  It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of the oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride  an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen  Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions  that is  they have a negative electron affinity   The macroscopic physical properties of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms  The attractive force increases with the size of the atom as a result of the increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential  This results in systematic group trends  as one goes down group 18  the atomic radius  and with it the interatomic forces  increases  resulting in an increasing melting point  boiling point  enthalpy of vaporization  and solubility  The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass   The noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard conditions  but their deviations from the ideal gas law provided important clues for the study of intermolecular interactions  The Lennard Jones potential  often used to model intermolecular interactions  was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles  The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical  which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction  or isotropic   3  Chemical properties  The noble gases are colorless  odorless  tasteless  and nonflammable under standard conditions  They were once labeled group 0 in the periodic table because it was believed they had a valence of zero  meaning their atoms cannot combine with those of other elements to form compounds  However  it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds  causing this label to fall into disuse   Like other groups  the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration  especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior   The noble gases have full valence electron shells  Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding  Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons  However  heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium  making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases   3 1  Noble gas notation  As a result of a full shell  the noble gases can be used in conjunction with the electron configuration notation to form the noble gas notation  To do this  the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first  and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward  For example  the electron notation of Phosphorus is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3  while the noble gas notation is  Ne  3s2 3p3  This more compact notation makes it easier to identify elements  and is shorter than writing out the full notation of atomic orbitals   3 2  Compounds  The noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity  consequently  only a few hundred noble gas compounds have been formed  Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed  although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds   while xenon  krypton  and argon have shown only minor reactivity  The reactivity follows the order Ne   He   Ar   Kr   Xe   Rn   In 1933  Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and oxygen  He predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride    and xenon hexafluoride     speculated that might exist as an unstable compound  and suggested xenic acid could form perxenate salts  These predictions were shown to be generally accurate  except that is now thought to be both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable   Xenon compounds are the most numerous of the noble gas compounds that have been formed  Most of them have the xenon atom in the oxidation state of +2  +4  +6  or +8 bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen  as in xenon difluoride     xenon tetrafluoride     xenon hexafluoride     xenon tetroxide     and sodium perxenate     Xenon reacts with fluorine to form numerous xenon fluorides according to the following equations   Some of these compounds have found use in chemical synthesis as oxidizing agents    in particular  is commercially available and can be used as a fluorinating agent  As of 2007  about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified  including organoxenon compounds  containing xenon bonded to carbon   and xenon bonded to nitrogen  chlorine  gold  mercury  and xenon itself  Compounds of xenon bound to boron  hydrogen  bromine  iodine  beryllium  sulphur  titanium  copper  and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas matrices  or in supersonic noble gas jets   In theory  radon is more reactive than xenon  and therefore should form chemical bonds more easily than xenon does  However  due to the high radioactivity and short half life of radon isotopes  only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice   Krypton is less reactive than xenon  but several compounds have been reported with krypton in the oxidation state of +2  Krypton difluoride is the most notable and easily characterized  Under extreme conditions  krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2 according to the following equation   Compounds in which krypton forms a single bond to nitrogen and oxygen have also been characterized  but are only stable below and respectively   Krypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals  hydrogen  chlorine  carbon  as well as some late transition metals  copper  silver  gold  have also been observed  but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices  or in supersonic noble gas jets  Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000  such as argon fluorohydride  HArF   and some bound to the late transition metals copper  silver  and gold  As of 2007  no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known   The noble gases—including helium—can form stable molecular ions in the gas phase  The simplest is the helium hydride molecular ion  HeH+  discovered in 1925  Because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe  hydrogen and helium  it is believed to occur naturally in the interstellar medium  although it has not been detected yet  In addition to these ions  there are many known neutral excimers of the noble gases  These are compounds such as ArF and KrF that are stable only when in an excited electronic state  some of them find application in excimer lasers   In addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a covalent bond  noble gases also form non covalent compounds  The clathrates  first described in 1949  consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances  The essential condition for their formation is that the guest  noble gas  atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice  For instance  argon  krypton  and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone  but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained  Neon  argon  krypton  and xenon also form clathrate hydrates  where the noble gas is trapped in ice   Noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds  in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule  In 1993  it was discovered that when   a spherical molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms  is exposed to noble gases at high pressure  complexes such as can be formed  the @ notation indicates He is contained inside but not covalently bound to it   As of 2008  endohedral complexes with helium  neon  argon  krypton  and xenon have been obtained  These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of the noble gas atom   Noble gas compounds such as xenon difluoride    are considered to be hypervalent because they violate the octet rule  Bonding in such compounds can be explained using a three center four electron bond model  This model  first proposed in 1951  considers bonding of three collinear atoms  For example  bonding in is described by a set of three molecular orbitals  MOs  derived from p orbitals on each atom  Bonding results from the combination of a filled p orbital from Xe with one half filled p orbital from each F atom  resulting in a filled bonding orbital  a filled non bonding orbital  and an empty antibonding orbital  The highest occupied molecular orbital is localized on the two terminal atoms  This represents a localization of charge which is facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine   The chemistry of heavier noble gases  krypton and xenon  are well established  The chemistry of the lighter ones  argon and helium  is still at an early stage  while a neon compound is still yet to be identified   4  Occurrence and production  The abundances of the noble gases in the universe decrease as their atomic numbers increase  Helium is the most common element in the universe after hydrogen  with a mass fraction of about 24%  Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis  but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis  and  to a very slight degree  the alpha decay of heavy elements   Abundances on Earth follow different trends  for example  helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere  The reason is that there is no primordial helium in the atmosphere  due to the small mass of the atom  helium cannot be retained by the Earth s gravitational field  Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth s crust  and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits  The abundance of argon  on the other hand  is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium 40  also found in the Earth s crust  to form argon 40  which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System  This process is the base for the potassium argon dating method  Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere  in what has been called the missing xenon problem  one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth s crust  After the discovery of xenon dioxide  a research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in the quartz  Radon is formed in the lithosphere as from the alpha decay of radium  It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated  Due to its high radioactivity  radon presents a significant health hazard  it is implicated in an estimated 21 000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone   For large scale use  helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas  which can contain up to 7% helium  Neon  argon  krypton  and xenon are obtained from air using the methods of liquefaction of gases  to convert elements to a liquid state  and fractional distillation  to separate mixtures into component parts  Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas  and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds  The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance  with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive  As an example  the table to the right lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas   5  Applications  Noble gases have very low boiling and melting points  which makes them useful as cryogenic refrigerants  In particular  liquid helium  which boils at   is used for superconducting magnets  such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance  Liquid neon  although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium  also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40 times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen   Helium is used as a component of breathing gases to replace nitrogen  due its low solubility in fluids  especially in lipids  Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving  which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis  Due to its reduced solubility  little helium is taken into cell membranes  and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures  such as in trimix or heliox  a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained  Helium s reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness  or the bends  The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent  Another noble gas  argon  is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving  Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors   Since the Hindenburg disaster in 1937  helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons due to its lightness and incombustibility  despite an 8 6% decrease in buoyancy   In many applications  the noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere  Argon is used in the synthesis of air sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen  Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds  such as reactive intermediates  by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures  Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography  as a filler gas for thermometers  and in devices for measuring radiation  such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber  Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting  as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry   Noble gases are commonly used in lighting because of their lack of chemical reactivity  Argon  mixed with nitrogen  is used as a filler gas for incandescent light bulbs  Krypton is used in high performance light bulbs  which have higher color temperatures and greater efficiency  because it reduces the rate of evaporation of the filament more than argon  halogen lamps  in particular  use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of iodine or bromine  The noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside gas discharge lamps  such as  neon lights   These lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors  which add various hues to the orange red color of neon  Xenon is commonly used in xenon arc lamps which  due to their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles daylight  find application in film projectors and as automobile headlamps   The noble gases are used in excimer lasers  which are based on short lived electronically excited molecules known as excimers  The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2  Kr2 or Xe2  or more commonly  the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF  KrF  XeF  or XeCl  These lasers produce ultraviolet light which  due to its short wavelength  193 nm for ArF and 248 nm for KrF   allows for high precision imaging  Excimer lasers have many industrial  medical  and scientific applications  They are used for microlithography and microfabrication  which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture  and for laser surgery  including laser angioplasty and eye surgery   Some noble gases have direct application in medicine  Helium is sometimes used to improve the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers  Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids  which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide  and because it is readily eliminated from the body  resulting in faster recovery  Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI  Radon  which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts  is used in radiotherapy   6  Discharge color  The color of gas discharge emission depends on several factors  including the following   discharge parameters  local value of current density and electric field  temperature  etc  – note the color variation along the discharge in the top row    gas purity  even small fraction of certain gases can affect color    material of the discharge tube envelope – note suppression of the UV and blue components in the bottom row tubes made of thick household glass   7  See also  Noble gas  data page   for extended tables of physical properties   Noble metal  for metals that are resistant to corrosion or oxidation   Inert gas  for
