south  Vermont to the west  Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east  and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north  New Hampshire is the 5th smallest  and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States   In January 1776 it became the first of the British North American colonies to establish a government independent of Great Britain s authority  although it did not declare its independence at the time  Six months later  it became one of the original 13 states that founded the United States of America  and in June 1788 it was the ninth state to ratify the United States Constitution  bringing that document into effect  New Hampshire was the first U S  state to have its own state constitution   It is known internationally for the New Hampshire primary  the first primary in the U S  presidential election cycle  Concord is the state capital  while Manchester is the largest city in the state  It has no general sales tax  nor is personal income  other than interest and dividends  taxed at either the state or local level   Its license plates carry the state motto   Live Free or Die   The state s nickname   The Granite State   refers to its extensive granite formations and quarries   Among prominent individuals from New Hampshire are founding father Nicholas Gilman  Senator Daniel Webster  Revolutionary War hero John Stark  editor Horace Greeley  founder of the Christian Science religion Mary Baker Eddy  poet Robert Frost  astronaut Alan Shepard  and author Dan Brown  Additionally  actor Adam Sandler grew up  but was not born in  the state  New Hampshire has produced one president  Franklin Pierce   With some of the largest ski mountains on the East Coast  New Hampshire s major recreational attractions include skiing  snowmobiling  and other winter sports  hiking and mountaineering  observing the fall foliage  summer cottages along many lakes and the seacoast  motor sports at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway  and Motorcycle Week  a popular motorcycle rally held in Weirs Beach near Laconia in June  The White Mountain National Forest links the Vermont and Maine portions of the Appalachian Trail  and boasts the Mount Washington Auto Road  where visitors may drive to the top of Mount Washington   1  Geography  New Hampshire is part of the New England region  It is bounded by Quebec  Canada  to the north and northwest  Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east  Massachusetts to the south  and Vermont to the west  New Hampshire s major regions are the Great North Woods  the White Mountains  the Lakes Region  the Seacoast  the Merrimack Valley  the Monadnock Region  and the Dartmouth Lake Sunapee area  New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U S  coastal state  with a length of   sometimes measured as only 13 miles  New Hampshire was home to the rock formation called the Old Man of the Mountain  a face like profile in Franconia Notch  until the formation disintegrated in May 2003   The White Mountains range in New Hampshire spans the north central portion of the state  with Mount Washington the tallest in the northeastern U S  – site of the second highest wind speed ever recorded – and other mountains like Mount Madison and Mount Adams surrounding it  With hurricane force winds every third day on average  over 100 recorded deaths among visitors  and conspicuous krumholtz  dwarf  matted trees much like a carpet of bonsai trees   the climate on the upper reaches of Mount Washington has inspired the weather observatory on the peak to claim that the area has the  World s Worst Weather    In the flatter southwest corner of New Hampshire  the landmark Mount Monadnock has given its name to a class of earth forms – a monadnock – signifying  in geomorphology  any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain   Major rivers include the Merrimack River  which bisects the lower half of the state north south and ends up in Newburyport  Massachusetts  Its tributaries include the Contoocook River  Pemigewasset River  and Winnipesaukee River  The Connecticut River  which starts at New Hampshire s Connecticut Lakes and flows south to Connecticut  defines the western border with Vermont  The state border is not in the center of that river  as usually the case  but at the low water mark on the Vermont side  meaning that the entire river along the Vermont border  save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam  lies within New Hampshire  Only one town – Pittsburg – shares a land border with the state of Vermont  The  northwesternmost headwaters  of the Connecticut also define the Canadian border with New Hampshire   The Piscataqua River and its several tributaries form the state s only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at Portsmouth  The Salmon Falls River and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine  The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001  with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands  primarily Seavey s Island  that include the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  The U S  Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2002  leaving ownership of the island with Maine   The largest of New Hampshire s lakes is Lake Winnipesaukee  which covers in the east central part of New Hampshire  Umbagog Lake along the Maine border  approximately   is a distant second  Squam Lake is the second largest lake entirely in New Hampshire   New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any state in the United States  approximately long  Hampton Beach is a popular local summer destination  About offshore are the Isles of Shoals  nine small islands  four of which are in New Hampshire  known as the site of a 19th century art colony founded by poet Celia Thaxter  and the alleged location of one of the buried treasures of the pirate Blackbeard   It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country  New Hampshire is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  Much of the state  in particular the White Mountains  is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England Acadian forests  The southeast corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River along the Vermont border are covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests   The northern third of the state is locally referred to as the  north country  or  north of the notches   in reference to White Mountain passes that channel traffic  It contains less than 5% of the state s population  suffers relatively high poverty  and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline  However  the tourist industry  in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to ski  snowboard  hike and mountain bike  has helped offset economic losses from mill closures   1 1  Climate  New Hampshire experiences a humid continental climate  Köppen climate classification Dfa in southern areas and Dfb in the north   with warm  humid summers  cold  wet winters  and uniform precipitation all year  The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and averages relatively milder and wetter weather  while the northern and interior portions experience cooler temperatures and lower humidity  Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state  and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas  Average annual snowfall ranges from to over across the state   Average daytime highs are in the mid 70s°F to low 80s°F  around 24–28 °C  throughout the state in July  with overnight lows in the mid 50s°F to low 60s°F  13–15 °C   January temperatures range from an average high of on the coast to overnight lows below in the far north and at high elevations  Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly with some variation occurring in the White Mountains due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall  New Hampshire s highest recorded temperature was in Nashua on July 4  1911  while the lowest recorded temperature was atop Mount Washington on January 29  1934  Mount Washington also saw an unofficial reading on January 22  1885  which  if made official  would tie the all time record low for New England  also at Big Black River  Maine on January 16  2009  and Bloomfield  Vermont on December 30  1933    Extreme snow is often associated with a nor easter  such as the Blizzard of  78 and the Blizzard of 1993  when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours  Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter  often associated with an Alberta Clipper   New Hampshire  on occasion  is affected by hurricanes and tropical storms although by the time they reach the state they are often extratropical  with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the Gulf of Maine  Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide   The National Arbor Day Foundation plant hardiness zone map depicts zones 3  4  5  and 6 occurring throughout the state and indicates the transition from a relatively cooler to warmer climate as one travels southward across New Hampshire  The 1990 USDA plant hardiness zones for New Hampshire range from zone 3b in the north to zone 5b in the south   1 2  Metropolitan areas  Metropolitan areas in the New England region are defined by the U S  Census Bureau as New England City and Town Areas  NECTAs   The following is a list of NECTAs in New Hampshire   Berlin  Claremont  Concord  Franklin  Keene  Laconia  Lebanon – Hartford  VT  Manchester  Nashua Metropolitan Division  part of Boston metropolitan area   Portsmouth  Rochester – Dover From  1 3  Earthquakes  While New Hampshire  along with the rest of New England  does not frequently experience earthquakes  it has experienced several in history and has been affected by some of the larger events that were centered in the Saint Lawrence rift system in Canada  One of these was the 1663 Charlevoix earthquake that was centered near the Quebec–Maine border  the magnitude of which has since been estimated at 7 3–7 9  In 1727  Newbury  Massachusetts experienced a damaging earthquake that shook New Hampshire also  The 1755 Cape Ann earthquake  estimated magnitude 5 5–6 0  also shook most or all of New Hampshire  On November 9  1810  Exeter experienced an estimated intensity VI  Strong  tremor  It was accompanied by an unusual noise like an explosion  and broke windows in Portsmouth  Concord  the capital  experienced a series of shocks between 1872 and 1891  One earthquake was felt in late 1872  lasting 10 seconds in Concord  and was felt in Laconia and other towns to the north  Ten years later  another tremor was strongest in Concord  although Dover and Pittsfield reportedly had buildings shaken  On November 23  1884  a light shock was followed fifteen minutes later by a severe earthquake in Concord  The second shock was felt in Massachusetts  Connecticut  and eastern New York  Concord s last tremor in that period was mild and was reported in Cambridge and Melrose  Massachusetts   Southeastern New Hampshire and Maine experienced an earthquake in 1925  Dishes and goods were jostled from shelves in Ossipee  Tuftonboro  and Effingham Falls  In 1929 the Grand Banks of Newfoundland   to the east  experienced a magnitude 7 2 earthquake and New Hampshire felt minor effects  In 1935  a 6 25 earthquake centered in Timiskaming  Ontario  away  was felt in an area of over   and some places in New Hampshire experienced Mercalli Intensities as high as V  Moderate   Ossipee Lake was the site of two moderate earthquakes in December 1940  It was felt in all six New England states  as well as parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania  In the epicentral area  a large number of aftershocks happened  One observer counted over 120 aftershocks through January 31  1941   2  History  Various Algonquian  Abenaki and Pennacook  tribes inhabited the area prior to European settlement  English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600–1605  and English fishermen settled at Odiorne s Point in present day Rye in 1623  The first permanent settlement was at Hilton s Point  present day Dover   By 1631  the Upper Plantation comprised modern day Dover  Durham and Stratham  in 1679  it became the  Royal Province   Father Rale s War was fought between the colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy throughout New Hampshire   New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution  By the time of the American Revolution  New Hampshire was a divided province  The economic and social life of the Seacoast revolved around sawmills  shipyards  merchant s warehouses  and established village and town centers  Wealthy merchants built substantial homes  furnished them with the finest luxuries  and invested their capital in trade and land speculation  At the other end of the social scale  there developed a permanent class of day laborers  mariners  indentured servants and even slaves   The only battle fought in New Hampshire was the raid on Fort William and Mary  December 14  1774  in Portsmouth Harbor  which netted the rebellion sizable quantities of gunpowder  small arms and cannon   General Sullivan  leader of the raid  described it as   remainder of the powder  the small arms  bayonets  and cartouche boxes  together with the cannon and ordnance stores   over the course of two nights  This raid was preceded by a warning to local patriots the previous day  by Paul Revere on December 13  1774  that the fort was to be reinforced by troops sailing from Boston  According to unverified accounts  the gunpowder was later used at the Battle of Bunker Hill  transported there by Major Demerit  who was one of several New Hampshire patriots who stored the powder in their homes until it was transported elsewhere for use in revolutionary activities   New Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold  the state sent Franklin Pierce to the White House in the election of 1852  Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills  which in turn attracted large flows of immigrants from Quebec  the  French Canadians   and Ireland  The northern parts of the state produced lumber and the mountains provided tourist attractions  After 1960  the textile industry collapsed  but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and a service provider   Since 1952  New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its presidential primary held early in every presidential election year  It immediately became the most important testing grounds for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations  The media gave New Hampshire  and Iowa  about half of all the attention paid to all states in the primary process  magnifying the state s decision powers  and spurring repeated efforts by out of state politicians to change the rules    3  Demographics  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of New Hampshire was 1 326 813 on July 1  2014  a 0 79% increase since the 2010 United States Census  The center of population of New Hampshire is located in Merrimack County  in the town of Pembroke  The center of population has moved south since 1950  a reflection of the fact that the fastest growth in the state has been along its southern border  which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities   3 1  Race and ancestry  According to the 2010 U S  Census  the racial makeup of New Hampshire was as follows   93 9% White American  92 3% Non Hispanic

descended largely from mill workers  and many still live in the former mill towns  like Manchester  New Hampshire has one of the highest percentages  23 3% of the population  of residents of French French Canadian Acadian ancestry of any U S  state    estimates  Maine had a slightly higher percentage    According to the 2000 United States Census  3 41% of the population aged 5 and older speak French at home  while 1 60% speak Spanish   In Coös County  16% of the population speaks French at home   3 2  Religion  A Pew survey showed that the religious affiliations of the people of New Hampshire was as follows  Protestant 34%  Catholic 29%  LDS  Mormon  1%  Jewish 1%  Jehovah s Witness 0 5%  Muslim 0 5%  Buddhist 1%  Hindu 0 5% and non religious at 26%   A survey suggests that

$60 billion  ranking 40th in the United States  Median household income in 2008 was $49 467  the seventh highest in the country  Its agricultural outputs are dairy products  nursery stock  cattle  apples and eggs  Its industrial outputs are machinery  electric equipment  rubber and plastic products and tourism   New Hampshire experienced a significant shift in its economic base during the last century  Historically  the base was composed of the traditional New England manufactures of textiles  shoe making  and small machining shops drawing upon low wage labor from nearby small farms and from parts of Quebec  Today  these sectors contribute only 2% for textiles  2% for leather goods  and 9% for machining of the state s total manufacturing dollar value  Source  U S  Economic Census for 1997  Manufacturing  New Hampshire   They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the South   The state s budget in FY2008 was $5 11 billion  including $1 48 billion in federal funds  The issue of taxation is controversial in New Hampshire  which has a property tax  subject to municipal control  but no broad sales tax or income tax  The state does have narrower taxes on meals  lodging  vehicles  business and investment income  and tolls on state roads   According to the Energy Information Administration  New Hampshire s energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country  The Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant  located near Portsmouth  is the largest nuclear reactor in New England and provides about 30 percent of New Hampshire’s electricity  Two natural gas fired plants and some fossil fuel powered plants  including the coal fired Merrimack Station plant in Bow  provide most of the rest   New Hampshire s residential electricity use is low compared with the national average  in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating  Over half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating  New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power  hydroelectricity  and wood fuel   The state has no general sales tax and no personal state income tax  the state does tax  at a 5 percent rate  income from dividends and interest   and the legislature has exercised fiscal restraint  Efforts to diversify the state s general economy have been ongoing   New Hampshire s lack of a broad based tax system has resulted in the state s local communities having some of the nation s highest property taxes  However  the state s overall tax burden is relatively low  in 2010 New Hampshire ranked 44th highest among states in combined average state and local tax burden   As of February 2010  the state s unemployment rate was 7 1%  By October 2010  the unemployment rate dropped to 5 4%   According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International  New Hampshire had the eighth highest number of millionaires per capita in the United States  with a ratio of 6 48 percent  In 2013  New Hampshire also had the nation’s lowest poverty rate at just 8 7% of all residents according to the Census Bureau   5  Law and government  The Governor of New Hampshire is Maggie Hassan  Democrat   New Hampshire s two U S  senators are Jeanne Shaheen  Democrat  and Kelly Ayotte  Republican   New Hampshire s two U S  representatives are Carol Shea Porter  Democrat  and Ann McLane Kuster  Democrat    New Hampshire is an alcoholic beverage control state  and through the State Liquor Commission it takes in $100 million from the sale and distribution of liquor   The state has offered civil unions since January 1  2008  and  on January 1  2010  same sex marriage became legal   5 1  Governing documents  The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state  followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules  These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution  United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively   5 2  Branches of government  New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch  consisting of the governor and a five member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5 000 and  advises and consents  to the governor s nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests  New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor  the Senate president serves as  acting governor  whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties   The legislature is called the General Court  It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate  There are 400 representatives  making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English speaking world  and 24 senators  Most are effectively volunteers  nearly half of which are retirees   For details  see the article on Government of New Hampshire    The state s sole appellate court is the New Hampshire Supreme Court  The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases  The other state courts are the Probate Court  District Court  and the Family Division   5 3  Local government  New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns   New Hampshire is a  Dillon Rule  state  meaning that the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities  Even so  the legislature strongly favors local control  particularly with regard to land use regulations  New Hampshire municipalities are classified as towns or cities  which differ primarily by the form of government  Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government  where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature  and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town  Larger towns and the state s thirteen cities operate either on a council manager or council mayor form of government  There is no difference  from the point of view of the state government  between towns and cities besides the form of government  All state level statutes treat all municipalities identically   New Hampshire has a small number of unincorporated areas that are titled as grants  locations  purchases  or townships  These locations have limited to no self government  and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed  As of the 2000 census  there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire  accounting for a total population of 175 people     several were entirely depopulated  All but two of these unincorporated areas are located in Coos County   5 4  Politics  The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are the only official parties  A plurality of voters are registered as undeclared  and can choose either ballot in the primary and then regain their undeclared status after voting  The Libertarian Party had official party status from 1990 to 1994   5 4 1  New Hampshire primary  New Hampshire is internationally famous for the New Hampshire primary  the first primary in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle  State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any  similar event   However  the Iowa caucus has preceded the New Hampshire primary  This primary  as the nation s first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election  draws more attention than those in other states  and has often been decisive in shaping the national contest   State law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight  and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots  As such  the communities of Dixville Notch in Coos County and Hart s Location in Carroll County  among others  have chosen to implement these provisions  Dixville Notch and Hart s Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U S  to vote in presidential primaries and elections   Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election  In Presidential election cycles  this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire   Saint Anselm College in Goffstown has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates because of its proximity to Manchester Boston Regional Airport   5 4 2  Election results  In the past  New Hampshire has often voted Republican  Between 1856 and 1988  New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times  Woodrow Wilson  twice   Franklin D  Roosevelt  three times   and Lyndon B  Johnson  once    Beginning in 1992  New Hampshire became a swing state in both national and local elections  The state supported Democrats Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996  John Kerry in 2004  and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012  It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican George W  Bush in the 2000 election to supporting his Democratic challenger in the 2004 election  when John Kerry  a senator from neighboring Massachusetts  won the state   The Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire in 2006 and 2008  In 2006  Democrats won both congressional seats  electing Carol Shea Porter in the 1st district and Paul Hodes in the 2nd district   re elected Governor John Lynch  and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses of the legislature for the first time since 1911  Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874  Neither U S  Senate seat was up for a vote in 2006  In 2008  Democrats retained their majorities  governorship  and Congressional seats  and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E  Sununu for the U S  Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest   The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority  13 of the 24 seats  in the New Hampshire Senate  a first for any legislative body in the United States   In the 2010 midterm elections  Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire  capturing veto proof majorities in the state legislature  taking all five seats in the Executive Council  electing a new U S  senator  Kelly Ayotte  winning both U S  House seats  and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor John Lynch compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins   In the 2012 state legislative elections  Democrats took back the New Hampshire House of Representatives and narrowed the Republican majority in the New Hampshire Senate to 13 11  In 2012  New Hampshire became the first state in U S  history to elect an all female federal delegation  Democratic Congresswomen Carol Shea Porter of Congressional District 1 and Ann McLane Kuster of Congressional District 2 will accompany U S  Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte in 2013  Further  the state elected its second female governor  Democrat Maggie Hassan   5 4 3  Free State Project  The Free State Project seeks to entice 20 000 individuals with libertarian leaning views to move to New Hampshire with the intent of reducing the size and scope of government at the local  state and federal levels through active participation in the political process  The Free State Project holds the annual New Hampshire Liberty Forum and the annual Porcupine Freedom Festival  also known as PorcFest   6  Transportation  6 1  Highways  New Hampshire has a well maintained  well signed network of Interstate highways  U S  highways  and state highways  State highway markers still depict the Old Man of the Mountain despite that rock formation s demise in 2003  Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states  State highway numbering does not indicate the highway s direction  Major routes include   Interstate 89 runs northwest from near Concord to Lebanon on the Vermont border   Interstate 93 is the main Interstate highway in New Hampshire and runs north from Salem  on the Massachusetts border
