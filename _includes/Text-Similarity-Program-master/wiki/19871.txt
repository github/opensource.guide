Marvel Superheroes  MSHRPG   aka  the FASERIP system   is a role playing game set in the Marvel Universe  first published by TSR under license from Marvel Comics in 1984  In 1986  TSR published an expanded edition  entitled the Marvel Superheroes Advanced Game  Jeff Grubb designed both editions  and Steve Winter wrote both editions  Both use the same game system   The basic game was designed to let players assume the roles of superheroes from Marvel Comics  such as Spider Man  Daredevil  Hulk  Captain America  the Fantastic Four  the X Men  and others  The game was designed to be easy to understand  and the simplest version  found in the 16 page  Battle Book  of the Basic Set  contains a bare bones combat system sufficient to resolve comic book style superheroic fights   1  System  1 1  Attributes  Most game situations are resolved by rolling percentile dice and comparing the results against a column of the colorful  Universal Results Table   The column used is determined by the attribute used  different tasks are resolved by reference to different attributes  All characters have seven basic attributes   Fighting  which determines hit probability in and defense against hand to hand attacks   Agility  which determines hit probability in and defense against ranged attacks  feats of agility vs  the environment  and similar acrobatics   Strength  which determines damage inflicted by hand to hand attacks as well as the success of tasks such as grappling or the lifting and breaking of heavy objects   Endurance  which determines resistance to physical damage  e g   poison  disease  death  it also determined how long a character can fight and how fast a character could move at top speed by exerting themselves   Reason  which determines the success of tasks relating to knowledge  puzzle solving  and advanced technology   Intuition  which determines the success of tasks relating to awareness  perception  and instinct   Psyche  which determines the success of tasks relating to willpower  psionics  and magic   Players sometimes refer to this set of attributes  or the game system as a whole  by the acronym  FASERIP   Attribute scores for the majority of characters range from 1 to 100  where normal human ability is 6  and peak  non superheroic  human ability is 30  However  the designers minimize use of the numerical figures  instead preferring adjectives in the Marvel Comics tradition  such as  Incredible   scores from 36 45  and  Amazing   46 62   A  Typical   5 7  attribute has a 50% base chance for success at most tasks relating to that attribute  For example  a character with  Typical  fighting skill has a base chance of 50% to connect with a punch  As an attribute increases  the chance of success increases by about 5% per 10 points  Thus a character with an  Amazing   50  attribute has a 75% chance of success at tasks relating to that attribute   1 2  Superpowers  Beyond the seven attributes  characters possessed superpowers  such as Spider Man s wall crawling  or Mister Fantastic s elasticity  The powers function on a mostly ad hoc basis  and thus each character s description gives considerable space to a description of how his or her powers work in the game   Each character had an origin  which put ceilings on a character s abilities and superpowers  The origins included  Altered Humans  normal people who acquired powers  such as Spider Man or the Fantastic Four   High Tech Wonders  normal people whose powers come from devices  e g   Iron Man   Mutants  persons born with superpowers  such as the X Men   Robots  created beings such as the Vision and Ultron   and Aliens  a blanket term used to cover non humans  including extra dimensional beings such as Thor and Hercules    1 3  Talents  The game also featured a simple skill system  referred to as Talents  Talents had to be learned and covered a wide range of knowledges from Archery to Zoology  A Talent raised a character s ability by one rank when attempting actions related to that Talent  For example  a character uses his Agility score when attempting ranged attacks  A character with an Agility of Excellent would normally roll on that column when attacking with a rifle  However  if he had the  Guns  Talent he would treat his Agility as the next higher power rank  Remarkable   The GM was free to determine if a character would be unable to attempt an action without the appropriate Talent  such as a character with no medical background attempting to make a pill that can cure a rare disease    1 4  Resources and Popularity  Characters also had two variable attributes  Resources and Popularity  These attributes were described using the same terms as the character s seven attributes   Poor    Amazing    Unearthly   etc    But unlike the seven physical and mental attributes which changed very slowly  if at all  Resources and Popularity could change very quickly   The first of the variables  Resources  represented the character s wealth and ability to obtain goods or services  Rather than have the player keep track of how much money the character had in the bank or with him  the Advanced Game assumed the character had enough money coming in to cover his basic living expenses  The Resources ability was used when the character wished to purchase something out of the ordinary like a new car or house  For example  the referee might decide a character with Typical resources would probably be unable to purchase a brand new sports car  but with a Yellow Resources roll might be able to afford a used car in good condition  The game books note that a character s Resources score can change for a variety of reasons  such as winning the lottery or having a major business transaction go bad   The second variable  Popularity  reflected how much the character was liked  or disliked  in the Marvel Universe  Popularity could be used to influence non player characters  A superhero with a high rating  like Captain America  whose popularity is Unearthly the highest most characters can achieve   might be able to use his Popularity to gain entrance to a club because the general population of the Marvel Universe admires him  If he were to try the same thing as his secret identity Steve Rogers  whose Popularity is only Typical   he would probably be unable to do it  Villains also had a Popularity score  which was usually negative  a bouncer might let Doctor Doom or Magneto into the aforementioned club simply out of fear   There were several ways Popularity could change  For example  if Doctor Doom defeated Spider Man in front of the general public  Spidey s Popularity would go down for a short time  But if everyone s favorite web slinger managed to foil one of Doctor Doom s plans and the word got out  he would enjoy a temporary Popularity boost  Since mutants were generally feared and distrusted in the Marvel Universe  these characters start with a Popularity of 0 and have a hard time improving this attribute   1 5  Character creation  The game was intended to be played using existing Marvel characters as the heroes  The Basic and Advanced Sets both contained fairly simple systems for creating original superheroes  based on random ability rolls  a la Dungeons & Dragons   In addition  the Basic Set Campaign Book also allowed players to create original heroes by simply describing the desired kind of hero  and working together with the GM to assign the appropriate abilities  powers  and talents   The Ultimate Powers Book  by David Edward Martin  expanded and organized the game s list of powers  making a fairly comprehensive survey of comic book style super powers  Players were given a wide variety of body types  secret origins  weaknesses  and powers  The UPB gave a much greater range to characters one could create  Additionally  the book suffered from editing problems and omissions  several errata and partial revisions were released in the pages of TSR s publication Dragon Magazine in issue #122  The Ultimate Addenda to the Ultimate Powers Book   issue #134  The Ultimate Addenda s Addenda   issue #150  Death Effects on Superheroes   and issue #151  Son of the Ultimate Addenda   The expanded  corrected version of the book is available for free on the Web  and was compiled by Zan of Heroplay   1 6  Karma  The game s equivalent of experience points was Karma  a pool of points initially determined as the sum of a character s three mental attributes  Reason  Intuition  and Psyche    The basic system allowed players to increase their chances of success at most tasks by spending points of Karma  For example  a player who wanted to make sure he would hit a villain in a critical situation could spend however many Karma points were necessary to raise the dice roll to the desired result  Additional Karma points were distributed by the referee at the end of game sessions  typically as rewards for accomplishing heroic goals  such as defeating villains  saving innocents  and foiling crimes  Conversely  Karma could be lost for unheroic actions such as fleeing from a villain  or failing to stop a crime  in fact  in a notable departure from many RPGs  but strongly in keeping with the genre   all Karma was lost if a hero killed someone or allowed someone to die   In the Advanced Game  Karma points could also be spent to permanently increase character attributes and powers  at a relatively moderate cost  ten times the attribute number raised  powers were steeper  at twenty times the number   The Karma system thus united two RPG mechanics— Action  or  Hero  points  which allow players to control random outcomes  and character advancement  e g    experience points  —in one system  Though this system could frustrate both referees and players  the former because a player willing and able to spend Karma could effectively overcome any challenge at least once  the latter because advancement was slow compared with most other RPGs   it had the virtue of emulating two central features of super hero comics  namely  that heroes almost always win  even in improbable circumstances  and that heroes  power levels remain mostly static  Furthermore  the system encouraged players to keep their characters  behavior to the equivalent concept of their alignment by giving an incentive to behave heroically and morally correct   2  Game mechanics  Marvel Superheroes was driven by two primary game mechanics  column shifts and colored results  Both essentially influenced the difficulty of an action   A column shift is used when a character is attempting an exceptionally hard or easy action  A column shift to the left indicates a penalty  while a shift to the right indicates a bonus  For example  Reed Richards  Mr  Fantastic  has an Intuition of Excellent  making him significantly more perceptive than the average person whose Intuition is Typical  two ranks lower   The GM might determine that spotting a trap hidden beneath a few sticks and leaves will be fairly easy  and give the player running Mr  Fantastic a +1 column shift  His Intuition will be treated as Remarkable  the next column to the right   However  a trap buried underground might be considerably harder to spot  and the GM might give the player a  1 column shift penalty  In this case  Mr  Fantastic s Intuition will only be treated as Good  the column to the left    The column for each ability is divided into four colors  white  green  yellow  and red  A white result is always a failure or unfavorable outcome  In most cases  getting a green result was all that was needed to succeed at a particular action  Yellow and red results usually indicated more favorable results that could knock back  stun  or even kill an opponent  However  the GM could determine that succeeding at an exceptionally hard task might require a yellow or red result   Additional rules in the  Campaign Book  of the Basic Set  and the subsequent Advanced Set  used the same game mechanic to resolve non violent tasks  For example  if a superhero needs to figure out how to operate a piece of alien technology  the hero would have to succeed at a Reason roll  where the chance of success is modified by the complexity of the device   3  Official game supplements  The original Marvel Super Heroes game received extensive support from TSR  covering a wide variety of Marvel Comics characters and settings  including a Gamer s Handbook of the Marvel Universe patterned after Marvel s Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  MSH even received its own column in the  at the time  TSR published gaming magazine  Dragon  called  The Marvel phile   which usually spotlighted a character or group of characters that hadn t yet appeared in a published game product   4  Later Marvel RPGs  Before losing the MSH license back to Marvel Comics  TSR published a different game using their SAGA System game engine  called the Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game  This version  written by Mike Selinker  was published in the late 1990s as a card based version of the Marvel role playing game  though a method of converting characters from the prior format to the SAGA System was included in the core rules   Though critically praised in various reviews at the time  it never reached a large market and has since faded into obscurity   In 2003  after the gaming license had reverted to Marvel Comics  the Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game was published by Marvel Comics  This edition uses mechanics that are totally different from any previous versions  using a diceless game mechanic that incorporated a Karma based resolution system of  stones   or tokens  to represent character effort  Since its initial publication  a few additional supplements were published by Marvel Comics  However  Marvel stopped supporting the game a little over a year after its initial release  despite going through several printings of the core rulebook  Some fans continue to create material for it   In August 2011  Margaret Weis Productions acquired the licence to publish RPG based on Marvel superheroes  and the first book in their series  titled Marvel Heroic Roleplaying Basic Game  was released in February 28  2012  Margaret Weis Productions  however  found that although the game was critically acclaimed  winning two Origins Awards  Marvel Heroic Roleplaying  Civil War  didn’t garner the level of sales necessary to sustain the rest of the line  so they brought the game to a close at the end of April 2013   5  References  6  External links    classicmarvelforever com cast
