This article contains summaries and commentaries of the 100 stories contained in Giovanni Boccaccio s The Decameron   Each story of the Decameron begins with a short heading explaining the plot of the story  The 1903 J  M  Rigg English translation headings are used in many of these summaries  Commentary on the tale itself follows   1  First day  Before beginning the story telling sessions  the ten young Florentines  7 women and 3 men  referred to as the Brigata  gather at the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella and together decide to escape Black Death by leaving the city to stay in a fictional villa in the countryside for the next two weeks  Each agrees to tell one story each day for ten days  The stories are told in the garden of the first villa that the company stays at  which is located a few miles outside the city   Under the rule of Pampinea  the first day of story telling is open topic  Although there is no assigned theme of the tales this first day  six deal with one person censuring another and four are satires of the Catholic Church   1 1  First tale  I  1   Ser Cepparello  more commonly known as Ciapelletto  a notoriously wicked man  travels on a business to Burgundy  a region he is unknown in  as a favor to Musciatto Franzesi  Once there  he soon falls terminally ill  The two Florentine brothers who were housing him during his stay bring a friar from a nearby convent to hear his confession and give him his last rites  Ciappelletto proceeds to tell the friar lies about his life that make him seem very pure  while pretending to cringe over venial sins  He is completely believed by the friar  who preaches a sermon on his life after he passes away  The townspeople who hear the sermon believe that he was a holy man and revere him as a saint long after Ciapelletto died   Panfilo is the storyteller of the first tale of the entire collection  which is also the first tale ridiculing then current practices of the Roman Catholic Church  in this case canonization by the people   The earliest source of this story is found in chapter eight of Saint Sulpicius Severus s biography of Saint Martin of Tours  The biography dates from around 400 AD   1 2  Second tale  I  2   Abraham  a Jew of Paris  is the friend of Giannotto di Civignì  who for years has urged him to become a Christian  One day Abraham departs for Rome  telling Giannotto that he wants to see the leaders of the Church – the Pope and the Curia – to decide whether or not he wants to convert  Giannotto  knowing of the debauched and decadent ways of the Roman clergy  fears Abraham will never want to convert after witnessing the corruption of the Church  But when Abraham returns  he converts  concluding that if Christianity can still spread even when its hierarchy is so corrupt  it must be the true word of God   Neifile tells both the second story of the book and the second anti Catholic story  In this caustic story  the Jew converts because he logically concludes that only a religion supported by God could prosper despite the corruption of its leadership  The earliest source of this tale is in Busone da Gubbio s  Avventuroso Ciciliano   written in Italian in 1311  This tale has also been told about Muslims  including Saladin   1 3  Third tale  I  3   Saladin  a powerful sultan  finds that his treasury is exhausted  Melchizedek  a Jew  has money enough to cover the shortfall  but Saladin believes he is too avaricious to lend it fairly  Saladin tries to trick Melchizedek into giving offense  and justifying the seizure of his wealth  by asking him whether Judaism  Christianity  or Islam law is the true word of God  Melchizedek evades the trap by comparing it to the story of a merchant who had a precious ring and three virtuous sons  Having promised the ring  and with it  his estate  to all three  the king had two equally precious copies made and gave one ring to each son  Thus it could not be determined who was heir to the estate  Likewise  it cannot be determined which faith is the truth  Saladin appreciates Melchizedek s wisdom and decides to be honest with him  In the end  Saladin gets his loan and repays it and Melchizedek gets Saladin s respect and gifts of praise for his intelligence   Filomena narrates this tale  which portrays the main character as wise and in a positive light  Unlike other medieval and Renaissance authors  Boccaccio treats Jews with respect  Boccaccio may have had contact with Jews while living in Naples as a young man  The oldest source is found in a French work by Stephen of Bourbon called The Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit  However  a slightly younger  c  1270–1294  French poem called Li dis dou vrai aniel was Boccaccio s probable source  This tale was especially popular in the Renaissance and can be found in many versions all over Europe  It is also referred to as  The Tale of the Three Rings  and  The Legend of the Three Rings  and  according to Carlo Ginzburg  was quoted in the heresy trial of the Italian miller Menocchio   1 4  Fourth tale  I  4   A young monk lapses into seducing a young woman and is secretly observed by an elder abbot  However  he knows that he has been seen and so leaves  on pretense of finishing a task  and gives the key to his room to the abbot  who then goes to see the girl for himself and take his own advantage of her  The monk  who hid watching all of this  uses it to balk prosecution  The monk and the abbot quickly rush the woman out of the monastery and often bring her back in   Dioneo  who has acquired the reputation of the most bawdy of the storytellers  narrates this tale  The earliest surviving source for this anti clerical tale is found in Cento Novelle Antiche  an Italian compilation of short stories from the end of the 13th century  Boccaccio could have possibly also taken the tale from a French fabliau   L Evesque qui benit sa maitresse    The bishop who blesses his mistress     1 5  Fifth Tale  I  5   The Marchioness of Montferrat by a banquet of hens seasoned with wit checks the mad passion of the King of France   Fiammetta tells this story  which originates from The Thousand and One Arabian Nights   1 6  Sixth Tale  I  6   A well off man  becoming rather tipsy  rashly says that his wine is  good enough for Christ himself   The greedy inquisitor hears this and prosecutes him  After some time for attending to penances imposed upon him  he hears at a Mass that  you shall receive an hundredfold and shall possess eternal life   He returns to the inquisitor and marks large amounts of  swill  being given to the poor  He commiserates with the inquisitor saying  if he receives 100 times as much in the afterlife  he would be drowned  This incenses the inquisitor  but also embarrasses him for his gluttony   Emilia narrates yet another anti clerical tale  the fourth of the day so far  Some commentators have identified the inquisitor as Pietro della Aquila  the inquisitor of Florence in 1345   1 7  Seventh tale  I  7   Bergamino  with a story of Primasso  probably Hugh Primas  and the Abbot of Cluny  finely censures a sudden excess of avarice in Messer Can Grande della Scala   Filostrato tells this tale about Dante s benefactor  whom he praises in the Paradiso section of the Divine Comedy  xvii  68   1 8  Eighth tale  I  8   Guglielmo Borsiere by a neat retort sharply censures avarice in Messer Ermino de  Grimaldi   Just like the previous three novellas  Lauretta s tale tells of one person censuring another in a clever way  There is no known source for this tale   This tale also includes another Dante reference  this time to Inferno  xvi  66  Dante s influence is everywhere seen in the Decameron  from its subtitle  a reference to Inferno  v  to its physical arrangement and careful attention to medieval numerology  Also Boccaccio often tells tales about the lives of people whose souls Dante had met in his epic journey through the afterlife   1 9  Ninth tale  I  9   The censure of a Gascon lady converts the King of Cyprus from a churlish to an honourable temper   Elissa narrates another tale of censure  Boccaccio took this story directly from Cento Novelle Antiche  in which the male character is also the King of Cyprus   1 10  Tenth tale  I  10   Master Alberto da Bologna honorably puts to shame a lady who sought occasion to put him to shame in that he was in love with her   Pampinea narrates the last tale of the day  another tale of censure  the sixth of the day    2  Second day  Filomena reigns during the second day and she assigns a topic to each of the storytellers  Misadventures that suddenly end happily   2 1  First tale  II  1   Martellino pretends to be a paralytic  and makes it appear as if he were cured by being placed upon the body of St  Arrigo  His trick is detected  he is beaten and arrested  and is in peril of hanging  but finally escapes   Neifile narrates this tale  which  like I  1  ridicules the Catholic tradition of discerning the Saints  Although there is no known earlier source for this tale  the part where Martellino s friends are carrying him in on a cot references Mark 2 2 and Luke 5 19   2 2  Second tale  II  2   Rinaldo d Asti is robbed  arrives at Castle Guglielmo  and is entertained by a widow lady  his property is restored to him  the robbers caught and hanged  and he returns home safe and sound   This story seems to originate in the Panchatantra  a work originally composed in Sanskrit  and was already 1500 years old by the time Boccaccio retold it  Filostrato tells this version of the tale   2 3  Third tale  II  3   Three young men squander their substance and are reduced to poverty  Their nephew  returning home a desperate man  falls in love with an abbess  in whom he discovers the daughter of the King of England  She marries him  and he retrieves the losses and reestablishes the fortune of his uncles   Pampinea narrates this tale of which no earlier version is known   2 4  Fourth tale  II  4   Landolfo Ruffolo is reduced to poverty  turns corsair  is captured by Genoese  is shipwrecked  escapes on a chest full of jewels  and  being cast ashore at Corfu  is hospitably entertained by a woman  and returns home wealthy   Lauretta narrates   2 5  Fifth tale  II  5   Andreuccio da Perugia comes to Naples to buy horses  meets with three serious adventures in one night  comes safe out of them all  and returns home with a ruby   Fiammetta tells this story which is actually a combination of two earlier tales  The beginning of the tale is first recorded in about 1228 by Courtois d Arrass in his  Boivin de Provins   The portion of Andreuccio being trapped in the tomb of the archbishop and how he escapes comes from the Ephesian Tale by Xenophon of Ephesus  which was written in about 150 AD  That portion of the tale is so memorable that it was still being told as a true story in the cities and countryside of Europe in the early 20th century  2 6  Sixth tale  II  6   Madam Beritola loses two sons  is found with two goats on an island  goes thence to Lunigiana  where one of her sons takes service with her master  and lies with his daughter  for which he is put in prison  Sicily rebels against King Charles  the son is recognized by the mother  marries the master s daughter  and  his brother being discovered  is reinstated in great honor   Emilia tells this story  It resembles the story of Sir Isumbras  which dates from before 1320 and was very popular in medieval England   2 7  Seventh tale  II  7   The Sultan of Babylon sends one of his daughters  Alatiel  overseas  designing to marry her to the King of Algarve  By diverse adventures she comes in the space of four years into the hands of nine men in varied places  At last she is restored to her father  whom she quits again in the guise of a virgin  and  as was at first intended  is married to the King of Algarve   This scandalous tale is told by Panfilo  There is no agreement on its origin  probably because of the very eclectic nature of the plot  which may have been pieced together from various sources by Boccaccio  Some suggest One Thousand and One Nights or the Ephesian Tale may have given some inspiration to the author for this tale  but not enough that either could definitely been called a source   2 8  Eighth tale  II  8   The Count of Antwerp  laboring under a false accusation  goes into exile  He leaves his two children in different places in England  and takes service in Ireland  Returning to England an unknown man  he finds his son and daughter prosperous  He serves as a groom in the army of the King of France  his innocence is established  and he is restored to his former honors   Elissa narrates this story  which shares its theme of a woman s vengeance for being spurned with many ancient stories  However  a direct source may be the real life story of Pierre de La Broce and Lady of Brabant  Dante writes about the soul of the former in Purgatorio  vi  A literary source may have been a Provençal romance written in 1318 by Arnaud Vidal de Castelnaudary called Guillaume de la Barre  However  the theme is so common that pinning down one main source is very difficult   2 9  Ninth tale  II  9   Bernabò of Genoa  deceived by Ambrogiuolo  loses his money and commands his innocent wife to be put to death  She escapes  habits herself as a man  and serves the Sultan  She discovers the deceiver  and brings Bernabò to Alexandria  where the deceiver is punished  She then resumes the garb of a woman  and with her husband returns wealthy to Genoa   Filomena tells this story  which is best known to English readers through Shakespeare s Cymbeline  The oldest known version of this story is a French romance from the 13th century called Roman de la Violette ou de Gerard de Nevers by Gilbert de Montreuil   2 10  Tenth tale  II  10   Paganino da Monaco carries off the wife of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica  who  having learned where she is  goes to Paganino and in a friendly manner asks him to restore her  He consents  provided she be willing  She refuses to go back with her husband  Messer Ricciardo dies  and she marries Paganino   In the last tale of the second day Dioneo begins his pattern of telling the last tale of the day  which he will continue until the end of the Decameron  The moral of the story – that a young woman should not marry an old man – is common in late medieval vernacular literature   3  Third day  Neifile presides as queen during the third day  In these stories a person either has painfully acquired something or has lost it and then regained it   3 1  First tale  III  1   Masetto da Lamporecchio feigns to be mute  and obtains a gardener s place at a convent of women  who with one accord make haste to lie with him   Filostrato s tale of a man s devices that he employs to enjoy the physical company of a convent of nuns was also in Cento Novelle Antiche from the 13th century   3 2  Second tale  III  2   A groom lies with the wife of King Agilulf  who learns the fact  keeps his own counsel  finds out the groom and shears him  The shorn shears all his fellows and so comes safe out of the scrape   Pampinea s clever tale originates in either the Panchatantra  a Sanskrit story from the 4th century AD  or The Histories of Herodotus  However  Boccaccio s version is unique in that the husband in the tale preserves both his honor and that of his wife  and emphasis on  keeping up appearances  that is distinct of the Renaissance merchant class  to which Boccaccio belonged   3 3  Third tale  III  3   Under cloak of confession and a most spotless conscience  a lady  enamored of a young man  induces a dim witted friar unwittingly to provide a means to the entire gratification of her passion   Filomena narrates this story   3 4  Fourth tale  III  4   Dom Felice instructs Friar Puccio how to attain blessedness by doing a penance  Friar Puccio does the penance  and meanwhile Dom Felice has a good time with Friar Puccio s wife   Panfilo narrates   3 5  Fifth tale  III  5   Zima gives a palfrey to Messer Francesco Vergellesi  who in return suffers him to speak with his wife  She keeping silence  he answers in her stead  and the sequel is in accordance with his answer   This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha  a Sanskrit collection of tales  Boccaccio  though  may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters  which  although oriental in origin  was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written  Elissa narrates   3 6  Sixth tale  III  6   Ricciardo Minutolo loves the wife of Filippello Fighinolfi  and knowing her to be jealous  makes her believe that his own wife is to meet Filippello at a Turkish bath house on the ensuing day  whereby she is induced to go thither  where  thinking to have been with her husband  she discovers that she has tarried with Ricciardo   Fiammetta tells this tale  which like the previous one  was taken from The Seven Wise Masters   3 7  Seventh tale  III  7   Tedaldo  being in disfavour with his lady  departs from Florence  He returns thither after a while in the guise of a pilgrim  has speech of his lady  and makes her sensible of her fault  Her husband  convicted of slaying him  he delivers from peril of death  reconciles him with his brothers  and thereafter discreetly enjoys his lady   Emilia narrates this tale  which has no known previous version   3 8  Eighth tale  III  8   Ferondo  having taken a certain powder  is interred for dead  is disinterred by the abbot  who enjoys his wife  is put in prison and taught to believe that he is in purgatory  is then resuscitated  and rears as his own a boy begotten by the abbot upon his wife   Lauretta s tale of the elaborate ruses that an abbot undertakes to enjoy Ferondo s wife was probably taken by Boccaccio from a French fabliau by Jean de Boves called   Boccaccio not only capitalizes on the tale to poke fun at the clerics of his day  but also at the simple mindedness of some of his countrymen   3 9  Ninth tale  III  9   Gillette of Narbonne cures the King of France of a fistula  craves for spouse Bertrand de Roussillon  who marries her against his will  and hies him in despite to Florence  where  as he courts a young woman  Gillette lies with him in her stead  and has two sons by him  for which cause he afterwards takes her into favour and entreats her as his wife   Neifile narrates this tale  which was written first by the Sanskrit dramatist and poet Kālidāsa in his The Recognition of Śakuntalā  The time of Kālidāsa s life is uncertain  but some scholars think that he lived in the 5th century  Boccaccio may have taken the tale from an 11th century French version  This tale is the basis for Shakespeare s play All s Well That Ends Well   3 10  Tenth tale  III  10   Alibech  a non Christian girl of Gafsa  turns hermit  and is taught by Rustico  a monk  how the Devil is put in hell  She is afterwards conveyed thence  and becomes the wife of Neerbale   Dioneo narrates what is by far the most obscene and bawdy tale in the Decameron  Alibech  a naive young woman  wanders into the desert in an attempt to become closer to God  She happens upon the monk Rustico  and he deflowers her under the pretense of teaching her how to better please God  Alibech becomes more enthusiastic about putting the Devil back into Hell than Rustico  almost to the point of his ruin  Meanwhile  her family and family home are incinerated  leaving her the only heir  Neerbale kidnaps her  much to Rustico s relief and Alibech s displeasure  and Alibech is made to marry Neerbale  The night before the wedding  she is questioned by other women as to how Alibech served God in the desert  and upon explaining to her ladies how the Devil is put back into Hell  is informed that Neerbale will surely know how to help her serve God once more   Because of its  graphic  nature  this tale has at times been translated incompletely  as in John Payne s translation  where Alibech s sexual awakening is left untranslated and is accompanied with this footnote   The translators regret that the disuse into which magic has fallen  makes it impossible to render the technicalities of that mysterious art into tolerable English  they have therefore found it necessary to insert several passages in the original Italian   No known earlier versions of it exist   4  Fourth day  Boccaccio begins this day with a defense of his work as it is thus far completed  Although he says that portions of the earlier days were circulating among the literate citizens of Tuscany while the work was in progress  this is doubtful  Instead  Boccaccio is probably just shooting down potential detractors  The reader must remember that vernacular fictional prose was not a respected genre in 14th century Italy and some of the criticisms Boccaccio combats in the introduction to the fourth day were common attitudes towards the genre  Others  however  were specific to the Decameron itself   One criticism of the latter type was that it was not healthy for a man of Boccaccio s age – approximately 38 – to associate with young ladies  to whom the work is supposedly written  To defend against this criticism  which would never really enter into the thoughts of a real critic of the day  Boccaccio tells a story explaining how natural it is for a man to enjoy a woman s company  In this story Filipo Balducci is a hermit living with his son on Mount Asinaio after the death of his wife and travels occasionally to Florence for supplies  One day his son – now eighteen and having never before left the mountain – accompanies him because Filipo is too infirm to make the journey alone  While there the son becomes fascinated with women  even though he had never seen one before and Filipo regrets ever bringing his son to Florence   This is commonly referred to as the 101st story of the Decameron  The story originates in the Ramayana  a Sanskrit epic from the 4th century BCE  The tale was quite common during the medieval era  appearing in Barlaam and Josaphat  written in the 8th century   an exemplum of Jacques de Vitry  13th century  and Cento Novelle Antiche  also 13th century   The Seven Wise Masters  and Italian collection of fables called Fiori di Virtu  14th century   Odo of Shirton s  De heremita iuvene   12th century   and a French fabliau  13th century   The last two are the most probable sources for Boccaccio because in them the father refers to the women as  geese   whereas in the earlier versions he calls them  demons  who tempt the souls of men   Filostrato reigns during the fourth day  in which the storytellers tell tales of lovers whose relationship ends in disaster  This is the first day a male storyteller reigns   4 1  First tale  IV  1   Tancredi  Prince of Salerno and father of Ghismonda  slays his daughter s lover  Guiscardo  and sends her his heart in a golden cup  Ghismonda  the daughter  pours upon it a poisonous distillation  which she drinks and dies   Fiammetta narrates this tale  whose earliest source is a French manuscript written by a man named Thomas  However  it is referred to in the early 12th century of Tristan and Iseult   4 2  Second tale  IV  2   Friar Alberto deceives a woman into believing that the Angel Gabriel is in love with her  As an excuse to sleep with her  Friar Alberto tells her that Gabriel can enter his body  Afterward  for fear of her kinsmen  he flings himself out of her window and finds shelter in the house of a poor man  The next day the poor man leads him in the guise of a wild man into the piazza  where  being recognized  he is apprehended by his fellow monks and imprisoned   Pampinea tells the second tale of the day  which is a very ancient tale  Supposedly it comes from an episode in the life of Alexander the Great  Other notable previous recordings of it include Josephus s Jewish Antiquities  the Pantschantantra  and One Thousand and One Arabian Nights   4 3  Third tale  IV  3   Three young men love three sisters  and flee with them to Crete  The eldest of the sisters slays her lover for jealousy  The second saves the life of the first by yielding herself to the Duke of Crete  Her lover slays her  and makes off with the first  the third sister and her lover are charged with the murder  are arrested and confess the crime  They escape death by bribing the guards  flee destitute to Rhodes  and there in destitution die   Lauretta narrates   4 4  Fourth tale  IV  4   Gerbino  in breach of the plighted faith of his grandfather  King William  attacks a ship of the King of Tunis to rescue thence his daughter  She being slain by those aboard the ship  he slays them  and afterward he is beheaded   There is no known source for Elissa s tale   4 5  Fifth tale  IV  5   Lisabetta s brothers slay her lover  He appears to her in a dream and shows her where he is buried  She disinters the head and sets it in a pot of basil  whereon she daily weeps a great while  Her brothers take the pot from her and she dies shortly after   Filomena tells this story  one of the most famous in the Decameron  and the basis of John Keats  narrative poem Isabella  or the Pot of Basil   4 6  Sixth tale  IV  6   Andreuola loves Gabriotto  she tells him a dream that she has had  he tells her a dream of his own  and dies suddenly in her arms  While she and her maidservant are carrying his corpse to his house  they are taken by the Signory  She tells how the matter stands  is threatened with violence by the podestà  but will not brook it  Her father hears how she is bested  and  her innocence being established  causes her to be set at large  but she  being minded to tarry no longer in the world  becomes a nun   Panfilo  the first male storyteller of the day to narrate  tells this tale   4 7  Seventh tale  IV  7   Simona loves Pasquino  they are together in a garden  Pasquino rubs a leaf of sage against his teeth  and dies  Simona is arrested  and  with intent to show the judge how Pasquino died  rubs one of the leaves of the same plant against her teeth  and likewise dies   Emilia narrates   4 8  Eighth tale  IV  8   Girolamo loves Salvestra  yielding to his mother s prayers he goes to Paris  he returns to find Salvestra married  he enters her house by stealth  lays himself by her side  and dies  he is borne to the church  where Salvestra lays herself by his side  and dies   Neifile narrates   4 9  Ninth tale  IV  9   Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon slays his wife s lover  Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing  and gives her his heart to eat  Coming to wit thereof  she throws herself from a high window  dies  and is buried with her lover   Filostrato tells this story  which has so many similarities with tale IV  1 that both tales could have shared sources   4 10  Tenth tale  IV  10   The wife of a leech  deeming her lover  who has taken an opiate  to be dead  puts him in a chest  which  with him therein  two usurers carry off to their house  He comes to himself  and is taken for a thief  but  the lady s maid giving the Signory to understand that she had put him in the chest which the usurers stole  he escapes the gallows  and the usurers are fined for the theft of the chest   Dioneo  whose stories are exempt from being governed by the theme of each day  tells this tale of Buddhist origin   5  Fifth day  During the fifth day Fiammetta  whose name means small flame  sets the theme of tales where lovers pass through disasters before having their love end in good fortune   5 1  First tale  V  1   Cimon  by loving  waxes wise  wins his wife Iphigenia by capture on the high seas  and is imprisoned at Rhodes  He is delivered by Lysimachus  and the twain capture Cassandra and recapture Iphigenia in the hour of their marriage  They flee with their ladies to Crete  and having there married them  are brought back to their homes   Like the tale in the introduction to the fourth day  Panfilo s tale seems to derive from the story of Barlaam and Josaphat   5 2  Second tale  V  2   Gostanza loves Martuccio Gomito and after hearing that he is dead  gives way to despair  and hies her alone aboard a boat  which is wafted by the wind to Susa  She finds him alive in Tunis  and makes herself known to him  Having gained high place in the king s favour by way of his council  marries Gostanza and returns with her to Lipari   Emilia narrates this tale  one part of which  the motif of using extra fine bow strings  supposedly is based on a real event  according to a chronicle by Giovanni Villani  In Villani s story s Emperor Kassan of the Tartars thus defeated the Sultan of Egypt in 1299   5 3  Third tale  V  3   Pietro Boccamazza runs away with Agnolella and encounters a gang of robbers  The girl takes refuge in the woods and is guided to a castle  Pietro is taken but escapes from the robbers  After some adventures  he arrives at the castle and marries Agnolella  they return to Rome   Elissa tells this tale   5 4  Fourth tale  V  4   Ricciardo Manardi is found by Messer Lizio da Valbona after an affair with his daughter  whom he marries  and remains at peace with her father   Filostrato narrates this tale  which some claim bears a resemblance to  Lai du Laustic  by the famed late 12th century poet Marie de France  However  the resemblance is not strong and the story may be of either Boccaccio s invention or may come from oral tradition   5 5  Fifth tale  V  5   Guidotto da Cremona dies leaving a girl to Giacomino da Pavia  She has two lovers in Faenza  to wit  Giannole di Severino and Minghino di Mingole  who fight about her  She is discovered to be Giannole s sister  and is given to Minghino to wife   Neifile tells this story which has no previous literary recording   5 6  Sixth tale  V  6   Gianni di Procida  being found with a damsel that he loves  and who had been given to King Frederick  is bound with her to a stake  so to be burned  He is recognized by Ruggieri dell Oria  is delivered  and marries her   Pampinea narrates this tale   5 7  Seventh tale  V  7   Teodoro is sold to Messer Amerigo as a slave when still a child  He is christened and brought up together with Violente  the daughter of his master  The two fall in love and Violente eventually bears a boy  Threatened with death by her outraged father she names the father who is sentenced to the gallows  Amerigo orders his daughter to choose between knife or poison and the child to be killed  Traveling Armenian dignitaries recognize the condemned by a strawberry shaped birth mark  Thus his life is saved as well as Violente s in the last minute  The couple get the blessing of their father  get wedded to each other and live a happy life until old age   Lauretta narrates   5 8  Eighth tale  V  8   In his love for a young lady of the Traversari family  Nastagio degli Onesti squanders his wealth without being loved in return  He is entreated by his friends to leave the city  and goes away to Chiassi  where he sees a female ghost cursed to be hunted down and killed by a horseman and devoured by a pack of hounds every week  He finds out that the cursed horseman was in a similar situation to his own  and committed suicide while the woman died afterwards unrepentant for her role in his death  Nastagio then invites his kinfolk and the lady he loves to a banquet at this same place  so the ghost woman is torn to pieces before the eyes of his beloved  who  fearing a similar fate  accepts Nastagio as her husband   Filomena s tale may originate from the early 13th century Chronicle of Helinandus  However  the tale was a widespread one and Boccaccio could have taken it from any number of sources or even oral tradition   5 9  Ninth tale  V  9   Federigo degli Alberighi  who loves but is not loved in return  spends all the money he has in courtship and is left with only a falcon  which  since he has nothing else to give her  he offers to his lady to eat when she visits his home  then she  learning of this  changes her mind  takes him for her husband  and makes him rich   Fiammetta s tale  she is the speaker in this story  contrary to what a couple of incorrect sources may say  is also told about the legendary Hatim Tai  who lived in the 6th century and sacrificed his favorite horse to provide a meal for the ambassador of the Greek Emperor  This earliest version of the tale is of Persian origin   5 10  Tenth tale  V  10   Pietro di Vinciolo goes from home to sup  his wife brings a boy into the house to bear her company  Pietro returns  and she hides her gallant under a hen coop  Pietro explains that in the house of Ercolano  with whom he was to have supped  there was discovered a young man bestowed there by Ercolano s wife  the lady thereupon censures Ercolano s wife  but unluckily an ass treads on the fingers of the boy that is hidden under the hen coop  so that he cries for pain  Pietro runs to the place  sees him  and apprehends the trick played on him by his wife  which nevertheless he finally condones  for that he is not himself free from blame   As is custom among the ten storytellers  Dioneo tells the last and most bawdy tale of the day  This story is taken from Lucius Apuleius s 2nd century The Golden Ass   6  Sixth day  During the sixth day of storytelling  Elissa is queen of the brigata and chooses for the theme stories in which a character avoids attack or embarrassment through a clever remark   Many stories in the sixth day do not have previous versions  Boccaccio may have invented many of them himself  He certainly was clever enough to have created the situations and the retorts   6 1  First tale  VI  1   A knight offers to carry Madonna Oretta a horseback with a story  but tells it so ill that she prays him to dismount her   Filomena narrates this tale  which many see as revealing Boccaccio s opinion of what makes a good or bad storyteller  just as portions of Hamlet and A Midsummer Night s Dream contain Shakespeare s opinion of what makes a good or bad actor   6 2  Second tale  VI  2   Cisti  a baker  by an apt speech gives Messer Geri Spina to know that he has by inadvertence asked that of him which he should not   Pampinea narrates   6 3  Third tale  VI  3   Monna Nonna de  Pulci by a ready retort silences the scarce seemly jesting of the Bishop of Florence   Lauretta narrates   6 4  Fourth tale  VI  4   Chichibio  cook to Currado Gianfigliazzi  owes his safety to a ready answer  whereby he converts Currado s wrath into laughter  and evades the evil fate with which Currado had threatened him   Neifile narrates   6 5  Fifth tale  VI  5   Messer Forese da Rabatta  a knowledgeable jurist  and Master Giotto  a painter  make fun of each other s poor appearance while returning from Mugello   Panfilo narrates this tale   6 6  Sixth tale  VI  6   Michele Scalza proves to certain young men that the Baronci are the best gentlemen in the world and the Maremma  and wins a supper   Fiammetta narrates   6 7  Seventh tale  VI  7   Madonna Filippa  being found by her husband with her lover  is cited before the court  and by a ready and clever answer acquits herself  and brings about an alteration of the statute   Filostrato narrates this tale which modern readers with their ideas of gender equality can appreciate   6 8  Eighth tale  VI  8   Fresco admonishes his niece not to look at herself in the glass  if it is  as she says  grievous to her to see nasty folk   Emilia narrates  Admonitions against the sin of vanity were common in the medieval era   6 9  Ninth tale  VI  9   Guido Cavalcanti by a quip meetly rebukes certain Florentine gentlemen who had taken him at a disadvantage   Elissa narrates   6 10  Tenth tale  VI  10   Friar Cipolla  Italian word meaning  onion  promises to show certain country folk a feather of the Angel Gabriel  in lieu of which he finds coals  which he avers to be of those with which Saint Lawrence was roasted   Dioneo narrates this story which mocks the worship of relics  The story originates in the Sanskrit collection of stories called Canthamanchari  This story舒a classic from the collection舒takes place in Certaldo  Boccaccio s hometown  and the location where he would later die   Friar Cipolla s name means  Brother Onion   and Certaldo was famous in that era for its onions  In the story one can sense a certain love on Boccaccio s part for the people of Certaldo  even while he is mocking them   7  Seventh day  During the seventh day Dioneo serves as king of the brigata and sets the theme for the stories  tales in which wives play tricks on their husbands   7 1  First tale  VII  1   Gianni Lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night  he awakens his wife  who persuades him that it is a werewolf  which they fall to exorcising with a prayer  whereupon the knocking ceases   Emilia tells the first tale of the day  In it Boccaccio states that he heard it from an old woman who claimed it was a true story and heard it as a child  Although we will never know if Boccaccio really did hear the story from an old woman or not  it is possible   the story is certainly not true  It resembles an earlier French fabliau by Pierre Anfons called  Le revenant   Also  the English description of the creature as a  werewolf  is improper  The Italian word  fantasima describes a supernatural cat monkey creature or quite simply a ghost   7 2  Second tale  VII  2   Her husband returning home  Peronella bestows her lover in a barrel  which  being sold by her husband  she avers to have been already sold by herself to one that is inside examining it to see if it be sound  Whereupon the lover jumps out  and causes the husband to scour the barrel for him while he has his way with the wife  and afterwards has the husband carry it to his house   Filostrato narrates this tale  which Boccaccio certainly took from Apuleius s The Golden Ass  the same source as tale V  10   7 3  Third tale  VII  3   Friar Rinaldo lies with his godchild s mother  her husband finds him in the room with her  and they make him believe that he was curing his godson of worms by a charm   Elissa tells this tale  which has so many similar versions in French  Italian  and Latin  that it is impossible to identify one as a potential source for this one  The relationship between a child s godparent and biological parent was considered so sacred at the time that intercourse between them was considered incest  This belief is ridiculed by Boccaccio in a later tale  VII  10    7 4  Fourth tale  VII  4   Tofano one night locks his wife out of the house  she  finding that by no entreaties may she prevail upon him to let her in  feigns to throw herself into a well  throwing therein a great stone  Tofano comes out of the house  and runs to the spot  she goes into the house  and locks him out  and hurls abuse at him from within   Lauretta is the narrator of this very old tale  The earliest form of it is found in the Sanskrit Śukasaptati  The Parrot s Seventy Tales   which was compiled in the 6th century AD  A later version from the 11th century is found in Disciplina Clericalis  which was written in Latin by Petrus Alphonsi  a Jewish convert to Christianity  The tale was very popular and appears in many vernacular languages of the era   7 5  Fifth tale  VII  5   A jealous husband disguises himself as a priest  and hears his own wife s confession  she tells him that she loves a priest  who comes to her every night  The husband posts himself at the door to watch for the priest  and meanwhile the lady brings her lover in by the roof  and tarries with him   Fiammetta s tale most likely originates from a French fabliau or a possibly Provençal romance  both of which were recorded not too long before the Decameron was written   7 6  Sixth tale  VII  6   Madonna Isabella has with her Leonetto  her accepted lover  when she is surprised by Messer Lambertuccio  by whom she is beloved  her husband coming home about the same time  she sends Messer Lambertuccio forth of the house drawn sword in hand  and the husband afterwards escorts Leonetto home   Pampinea narrates this version of a common medieval tale which originates from the Hitopadesha of India  Later versions pass the tale into Persian  French  Latin  in The Seven Wise Masters   and Hebrew   7 7  Seventh tale  VII  7   Lodovico discovers to Madonna Beatrice the love that he bears her  she sends Egano  her husband  into a garden disguised as herself  and lies with Lodovico  who thereafter  being risen  hies him to the garden and cudgels Egano   Filomena s humorous tale probably derives from an earlier French fabliau   7 8  Eighth tale  VII  8   A husband grows jealous of his wife  and discovers that she has warning of her lover s approach by a piece of pack thread  which she ties to her great toe at nights  While he is pursuing her lover  she puts another woman in bed in her place  The husband  finding her there  beats her  and cuts off her hair  He then goes and calls his wife s brothers  who  holding his accusation to be false  subject him to a torrent of abuse   Neifile tells this tale  It comes originally from the Pantschatantra and later forms part of other tale collections in Sanskrit  Arabic  French  and Persian  Boccaccio probably used a French version of the tale   7 9  Ninth tale  VII  9   Lydia  wife of Nicostratus  loves Pyrrhus  who to assure himself thereof  asks three things of her  all of which she does  and therewithal enjoys him in presence of Nicostratus  and makes Nicostratus believe that what he saw was not real   Panfilo narrates  Boccaccio combined two earlier folk tales into one to create this story  The test of fidelity is previously recorded in French  a fabliau  and Latin  Lidia  an elegiac comedy   but comes originally from India or Persia  The story of the pear tree  best known to English speaking readers from The Canterbury Tales  also originates from Persia in the Bahar Danush  in which the husband climbs a date tree instead of a pear tree  The story could have arrived in Europe through the One Thousand and One Nights  or perhaps the version in book VI of the Masnavi by Rumi   7 10  Tenth tale  VII  10   Two Sienese men love a lady  one of them being her child s godfather  the godfather dies  having promised his comrade to return to him from the other world  which he does  and tells him what sort of life is led there   As usual  Dioneo narrates the last tale of the day  See the commentary for VII  3 for information about the relation between a child s parent and godparent   8  Eighth day  Lauretta reigns during the eighth day of storytelling  During this day the members of the group tell stories of tricks women play on men or that men play on women   8 1  First tale  VIII  1   Gulfardo borrows moneys of Guasparruolo  which he has agreed to give Guasparruolo s wife  that he may lie with her  He gives them to her  and in her presence tells Guasparruolo that he has done so  and she acknowledges that it is true   Neifile narrates  This tale  and the next one  comes from a 13th century French fabliau by Eustache d Amiens  English speakers know it best from Chaucer s  The Shipman s Tale   Chaucer borrowed from the same fabliau as Boccaccio did   8 2  Second tale  VIII  2   The priest of Varlungo lies with Monna Belcolore  he leaves with her his cloak by way of pledge  and receives from her a mortar  He returns the mortar  and demands of her the cloak that he had left in pledge  which the good lady returns him with a gibe   Panfilo tells this story  which can be considered a variation of VIII  1   8 3  Third tale  VIII  3   Calandrino  Bruno and Buffalmacco go in quest of the heliotrope  bloodstone  beside the Mugnone  Thinking to have found it  Calandrino gets him home laden with stones  His wife chides him  whereat he waxes wroth  beats her  and tells his comrades what they know better than he   Elissa narrates this tale  the first in which Bruno and Buffalmacco appear  The two were early Renaissance Italian painters  However  both are known far better for their love of practical jokes than for their artistic work  Boccaccio probably invented this tale himself  though  and used well known jokers as characters   8 4  Fourth tale  VIII  4   The rector of Fiesole loves a widow lady  by whom he is not loved  and thinking to lie with her  lies with her maid  with whom the lady s brothers cause him to be found by his Bishop   Emilia s tale originates from the fabliau  Le Prestre et Alison  by Guillaume Le Normand   8 5  Fifth tale  VIII  5   Three young men pull down the breeches of a judge from the Marches  while he is administering justice on the bench   Filostrato narrates   8 6  Sixth tale  VIII  6   Bruno and Buffalmacco steal a pig from Calandrino  and induce him to deduce its recovery by means of pills of ginger and Vernaccia wine  Of the said pills they give him two  one after the other  made of dog ginger compounded with aloes  and it then appearing as if he had had the pig himself  they constrain him to buy them off  if he would not have them tell his wife   Filomena narrates  Just like Bruno and Buffalmacco  Calandrino was also in reality a 14th century Italian Renaissance painter  However  Calandrino was known as a simpleton by his contemporaries  It is possible that this tale may be true and Boccaccio recorded it first  The test that Bruno and Buffalmacco submit Calandrino to was really a medieval lie detector test and the tale is consistent with what we know about the characters of the three painters   8 7  Seventh tale  VIII  7   A scholar loves a widow lady  who  being enamoured of another  causes him to spend a winter s night awaiting her in the snow  He afterwards by a stratagem causes her to stand for a whole day in July  naked upon a tower  exposed to the flies  the gadflies  and the sun   Pampinea tells this story of revenge over spurned love  which has many common analogues in many languages in antiquity  the Middle Ages  the Renaissance  and early modern periods   8 8  Eighth tale  VIII  8   Two men keep with one another  the one lies with the other s wife  the other  being aware of it  manages with the aid of his wife to have the one locked in a chest  upon which he then lies with the wife of him that is locked therein   Fiammetta narrates this tale  Like many of the eighth day it has a theme in common with many tales from the ancient and medieval era and it is not possible to point to one source that served as Boccaccio s inspiration   8 9  Ninth tale  VIII  9   Bruno and Buffalmacco prevail upon Master Simone  a physician  to betake him by night to a certain place  there to be enrolled in a company that go the course  Buffalmacco throws him into a foul ditch  and there they leave him   Lauretta narrates another tale about Bruno and Buffalmacco and their practical jokes  This story is probably just a vehicle for Boccaccio s ability to coin word play  just as tale VI  10 did   8 10  Tenth tale  VIII  10   A Sicilian woman cunningly conveys from a merchant that which he has brought to Palermo  he  making a show of being come back with far greater store of goods than before  borrows money of her  and leaves her in lieu thereof water and tow   Dioneo tells that this story is found in Alphonsus s Disciplina Clericalis and the Gesta Romanorum  both of which are written in Latin   9  Ninth day  Emilia is queen of the brigata for the ninth day  For the second time there is no prescribed theme for the stories of the day  the only other time was during the first day    9 1  First tale  IX  1   Madonna Francesca  having two lovers  the one Rinuccio  the other Alessandro  by name  and loving neither of them  induces the one to simulate a corpse in a tomb  and the other to enter the tomb to fetch him out  whereby  neither satisfying her demands  she artfully rids herself of both   Filomena narrates   9 2  Second tale  IX  2   An abbess rises in haste and in the dark  with intent to surprise an accused nun in bed with her lover  thinking to put on her veil  she puts on instead the breeches of a priest that she has with her  The nun  after pointing out her abbess s head covering  is acquitted  and thenceforth finds it easier to meet with her lover   Elissa is the narrator of this tale which was either taken from a fabliau by Jean de Condé written between 1313 and 1337  or from a story about Saint Jerome in The Golden Legend  written about 1260  The former was the more likely source for Boccaccio   9 3  Third tale  IX  3   Master Simone  at the instance of Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello  makes Calandrino believe that he is pregnant  Calandrino  accordingly  gives them capons and money for medicines  and is cured without being delivered   Filostrato narrates this humorous story   9 4  Fourth tale  IX  4   Cecco  son of Messer Fortarrigo  loses his all at play at Buonconvento  besides the money of Cecco  son of Messer Angiulieri  whom  running after him in his shirt and crying out that he has robbed him  he causes to be taken by peasants  he then puts on his clothes  mounts his palfrey  and leaves him to follow in his shirt   Niefile is the narrator of this tale   9 5  Fifth tale  IX  5   Calandrino being enamoured of a damsel  Bruno gives him a scroll  averring that  if he but touch her therewith  she will go with him  he is found with her by his wife  who subjects him to a most severe and vexatious examination   Fiammetta tells this story  the only one in which Bruno appears  but not Buffalmacco   9 6  Sixth tale  IX  6   Two young men lodge at an inn  of whom the one lies with the host s daughter  his wife accidentally lying with the other  He that lay with the daughter afterwards gets into her father s bed and tells him all  taking him to be his comrade  They exchange words  whereupon the good woman  apprehending the circumstances  gets her to bed with her daughter  and by divers apt words re establishes perfect accord   Panfilo s tale comes from Jean Bodel s fabliau  Gombert et les deus Clers   a story also used by Chaucer for The Reeve s Tale   9 7  Seventh tale  IX  7   Talano di Molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all the neck and face of his wife  he gives her warning thereof  which she heeds not  and the dream comes true   Pampinea narrates this tale  for which no known earlier source exists   9 8  Eighth tale  IX  8   Biondello gulls Ciacco in the matter of a breakfast  for which prank Ciacco is cunningly avenged on Biondello  causing him to be shamefully beaten   Lauretta acts as the narrator of this novella   9 9  Ninth tale  IX  9   Two young men ask counsel of Solomon  the one  how he is to make himself beloved  the other  how he is to reduce an unruly wife to order  The King bids the one to love  and the other to go to the Bridge of Geese  The one bid to love finds true love in return  The other observes a mule train crossing the bridge and sees that by beating a stubborn mule  the herder persuades it to cross the bridge  Upon returning home  he employs the same tactics on his wife  beating her senseless when she refuses to make what he wants for dinner  He wakes the next day to a hot breakfast and returns home that evening to his favorite meal  It appears he has cured his wife of her stubbornness   Emilia narrates this tale  which probably originated in Asia   9 10  Tenth tale  IX  10   Dom Gianni at the instance of his gossip Pietro uses an enchantment to transform Pietro s wife Gemmata into a mare  but  when he comes to attach the tail  Gossip Pietro  by saying that he will have none of the tail  makes the enchantment of no effect   Dioneo s bawdy story from a French fabliau   De la demoiselle qui vouloit voler en l air    10  Tenth day  Panfilo is the king of the last day of storytelling and he orders the company to tell stories about deeds of munificence  These tales seem to escalate in their degrees of munificence until the end  where the day  and the entire Decameron  reaches an apex in the story of patient Griselda   10 1  First tale  X  1   A knight in the service of the King of Spain deems himself ill requited  Wherefore the King  by most cogent proof  shows him that the blame rests not with him  but with the knight s own evil fortune  after which  he bestows upon him a noble gift   Neifile s story is one of the most widely diffused ones in the entire collection  Its origins come from two different stories  The first part  the comparison of the king to a mule  comes from Busone de Raffaelli da Gubbio s  Fortunatus Siculus   written about 1333 in Italian  The second part  concerning the caskets  known to English speakers from Shakespeare s The Merchant of Venice  originates from about 800 AD from Joannes Damascensus s account of Barlaam and Josaphat and was written in Greek  Boccaccio most likely was inspired  though  by the Gesta Romanorum   10 2  Second tale  X  2   Ghino di Tacco captures the Abbot of Cluny  cures him of a disorder of the stomach  and releases him  The abbot  on his return to the court of Rome  reconciles Ghino with Pope Boniface  and makes him prior of the Hospital   Elissa narrates  Ghino di Tacco is the Italian equivalent of the English Robin Hood  with the difference that di Tacco was a real person whose deeds as a chief of a band of robbers passed into legend  He lived in the latter half of the 13th century  Boccaccio s tale  though  is one of many legends that grew up around him   10 3  Third tale  X  3   Nathan  an elderly rich man of Cathay  is noted for his exceeding generosity towards the guests of his house on the road leading out of the capital  Mithridanes  a wealthy young man living not far from Nathan  attempts to emulate him  but is frustrated and resolves to kill him  Falling in with Nathan unawares  Nathan advises Mithridanes how to compass his end  Following Nathan s advice  he finds the older gentleman in a copse  and recognizing him  is shame stricken  and becomes his friend   Filostrato tells this tale  He attributes it to  various Genoese   but this may be seen as a reluctance to credit Marco Polo  as a Venetian an enemy of Florence and greatly disdained by Boccaccio personally   although no specific tale resembling this one appears in Polo s writings  his reports of Kublai Khan s generosity are likely the inspiration for the tale   10 4  Fourth tale  X  4   Messer Gentile de  Carisendi  from Modena  disinters a lady that he loves  who has been buried for dead  She  being reanimated  gives birth to a male child  and Messer Gentile restores her  with her son  to Niccoluccio Caccianimico  her husband   Lauretta gives this story  for which there is no clear surviving source   10 5  Fifth tale  X  5   Messer Ansaldo is in love with Madonna Dianora  a married woman  and often sends her messages of his love  She does not return his affections  and in an attempt to put him off says that she will only be his if he can prove his love by providing for her a garden as fair in January as it is in May  Messer Ansaldo hires for a great sum a necromancer  and thereby gives her the garden  Madonna Dianora tells her husband of her promise  and he says that  while he would prefer that she remain faithful to him if possible  she must keep her word to Messer Ansaldo  When Messer Ansaldo learns of this he releases her from her promise and she returns to her husband  From then on Messer Ansaldo felt only honorable affection for Madonna Dianora  The necromancer is impressed by this and refuses to take any payment from Messer Ansaldo   Emilia narrates  This tale is found in later manuscripts of the Śukasaptati  It is found in several story collections from Asia and in many languages   10 6  Sixth tale  X  6   King Charles the Old  being conqueror  falls in love with a young maiden  and afterward growing ashamed of his folly bestows her and her sister honourably in marriage   Fiammetta narrates   10 7  Seventh tale  X  7   King Pedro  being apprised of the fervent love borne him by Lisa  who thereof is sick  comforts her  and forthwith gives her in marriage to a young gentleman  and having kissed her on the brow  ever after professes himself her knight   Pampinea tells this tale  No earlier versions are known   10 8  Eighth tale  X  8   Sophronia  albeit she deems herself wife to Gisippus  is wife to Titus Quintius Fulvus  and goes with him to Rome  where Gisippus arrives in indigence  and deeming himself scorned by Titus  to compass his own death  avers that he has slain a man  Titus recognizes him  and to save his life  alleges that  twas he that slew the man  whereof he that did the deed being witness  he discovers himself as the murderer  Whereby it comes to pass that they are all three liberated by Octavianus  and Titus gives Gisippus his sister to wife  and shares with him all his substance   Filomena narrates this story  which Boccaccio may have taken from Alphonsus s  Disciplina clericalis   However  its ultimate source is from the East  although there are disputes as to exactly where or when   10 9  Ninth tale  X  9   Saladin  the Sultan  in guise of a merchant  is honourably entreated by Messer Torello  The Crusade ensuing  Messer Torello appoints a date  after which his wife may marry again  he is taken prisoner by Saladin  and by training hawks comes under Saladin s notice  Saladin recognizes him  makes himself known to him  and entreats him with all honor  Messer Torello falls sick  and by magic arts is transported in a single night to Pavia  where his wife s second marriage is then to be solemnized  and being present thereat  is recognized by her  and returns with her to his house   Panfilo is the narrator of this tale   10 10  Tenth tale  X  10   The Marquis of Saluzzo  Gualtieri  overborne by the entreaties of his vassals  consents to take a wife  but  being minded to please himself in the choice of her  takes a husbandman s daughter  He has two children by her  both of whom he makes her believe that he has put to death  Afterward  feigning to be tired of her  and to have taken another wife  he turns her out of doors in her shift  and brings his daughter into the house in guise of his bride  but  finding her patient under it all  he brings her home again  and shows her children  now grown up  and honours her  and causes her to be honoured  as Marchioness   Dioneo tells the final  and possibly most retold  story of the Decameron  Although Boccaccio was the first to record the story  he almost certainly did not invent it  Petrarch mentions having heard it many years before  but not from Boccaccio  Therefore  it was probably already circulating in oral tradition when the Decameron was written  Petrarch later retold the story in Latin  which is probably the biggest factor that contributed to its huge popularity in subsequent centuries   11  Conclusion  The work concludes rather abruptly  Boccaccio  as he does in the introduction of the fourth day  defends his work against detractors  However  this time he does it in a humorous and sacrilegious way   12  See also  Allegory in the Middle Ages  13  References  Brown University s  Lee  A  C   The Decameron  Its Sources and Analogues  1903  Boccaccio  Giovanni
