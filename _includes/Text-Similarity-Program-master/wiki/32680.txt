Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto  born Wilfried Fritz Pareto    15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923  was an Italian engineer  sociologist  economist  political scientist  and philosopher  He made several important contributions to economics  particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals  choices  He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term  elite  in social analysis   He introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics  He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution  which is a power law probability distribution  The Pareto principle was named after him and built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population  He also contributed to the fields of sociology and mathematics   1  Biography  Pareto was born of an exiled noble Genoese family in 1848 in Paris  the centre of the popular revolutions of that year  His father  Raffaele Pareto  1812–1882   was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much like Mazzini and other Italian nationalists  His mother  Marie Metenier  was a French woman  Enthusiastic about the 1848 German revolution  his parents named him Fritz Wilfried  which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family s move back to Italy in 1858  In his childhood  Pareto lived in a middle class environment  receiving a high standard of education  In 1869  he earned a doctor s degree in engineering from what is now the Polytechnic University of Turin  His dissertation was entitled  The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies   His later interest in equilibrium analysis in economics and sociology can be traced back to this paper   1 1  From Civil engineer to liberal  and then to economist  For some years after graduation  he worked as a civil engineer  first for the state owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry  He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works   He did not begin serious work in economics until his mid forties  He started his career a fiery liberal  besting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the free market  In 1886 he became a lecturer on economics and management at the University of Florence  His stay in Florence was marked by political activity  much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators  In 1889  after the death of his parents  Pareto changed his lifestyle  quitting his job and marrying a Russian  Alessandrina Bakunin  She left him in 1902 for a young servant   1 2  Economics and sociology  In 1893  he succeeded Léon Walras to the chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life  In 1906  he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy  later generalised by Joseph M  Juran into the Pareto principle  also termed the 80–20 rule   In one of his books published in 1909 he showed the Pareto distribution of how wealth is distributed  he believed  through any human society  in any age  or country   He maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists  but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed  He later became suspicious of their humanitarian motives and denounced socialist leaders as an  aristocracy of brigands  who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of Giovanni Giolitti for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes  Growing unrest among labor in Italy led him to the anti socialist and anti democratic camp  His attitude toward fascism in his last years is a matter of controversy   1 3  Personal life  In 1923 Pareto remarried with Jeanne Regis  just before he died in Geneva  Switzerland  19 August 1923   among a menagerie of cats that he and his French lover kept  in their villa   the local divorce laws prevented him from divorcing his wife and remarrying until just a few months prior to his death    2  Sociology  Pareto s later years were spent in collecting the material for his best known work  Trattato di sociologia generale  1916   The Mind and Society  published in 1935   His final work was Compendio di sociologia generale  1920    In his Trattato di Sociologia Generale  1916  rev  French trans  1917   published in English by Harcourt  Brace in a four volume edition edited by Arthur Livingston under the title The Mind and Society  1935   Pareto developed the notion of the circulation of elites  the first social cycle theory in sociology  He is famous for saying  history is a graveyard of aristocracies    Pareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice  in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened  His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non rational actions  We are driven  he taught  by certain  residues  and by  derivations  from these residues  The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk taking  and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite  which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the  foxes  or speculators  A catastrophe results  with a return to conservatism  the  lion  mentality follows  This cycle might be broken by the use of force  says Pareto  but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence   Pareto s sociology was introduced to the United States by George Homans and Lawrence J  Henderson at Harvard  and had considerable influence  especially on Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons  who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional   3  Fascism and power distribution  Benoît Mandelbrot writes   Pareto s discovery that power laws applied to income distribution embroiled him in political change and the nascent Fascist movement  whether he really sided with the Fascists or not  Fascists such as Mussolini found inspiration for their own economic ideas in his discoveries  He had discovered something that was harsh and Darwinian  in Pareto s view  And this fueled both the anger and the energy of the Fascist movement because it fueled their economic and social views  He wrote that  as Mandelbrot summarizes   Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself  For him  the key question was how actively the rulers ruled  For this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed Benito Mussolini s rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the  pure  economic forces   To quote Pareto s biographer   Karl Popper dubbed him the  theoretician of totalitarianism   but there is no evidence in Popper s published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgment in anti fascist circles   It is true that Pareto regarded Mussolini s triumph as a confirmation of certain of his ideas  largely because Mussolini demonstrated the importance of force and shared his contempt for bourgeois parliamentarism  He accepted a  royal  nomination to the Italian senate from Mussolini  But he died less than a year into the new regime s existence   Some fascist writers were much enamored of Pareto  writing such paeans as   But many modern historians reject the notion that Pareto s thought was essentially fascistic or that he is properly regarded as a supporter of fascism   4  Economic concepts  Pareto turned his interest to economic matters and he became an advocate of free trade  finding himself in difficulty with the Italian government  His writings reflected the ideas of Léon Walras that economics is essentially a mathematical science  Pareto was a leader of the  Lausanne School  and represents the second generation of the Neoclassical Revolution  His  tastes and obstacles  approach to general equilibrium theory were resurrected during the great  Paretian Revival  of the 1930s and have influenced theoretical economics since   In his Manual of Political Economy  1906  the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of  objectives and constraints   He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth  1881  extensively  for the theory of the consumer and  another great novelty  in his theory of the producer  He gave the first presentation of the trade off box now known as the  Edgeworth Bowley  box   Pareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility – that is  it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that  only that he preferred X of this to Y of that  Utility was a preference ordering  With this  Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics  but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy  which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number  Pareto said  good  cannot be measured   He replaced it with the notion of Pareto optimality  the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off  Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory  A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal   4 1  Concepts  Some economic concepts in current use are based on his work   The Pareto index is a measure of the inequality of income distribution  He argued that in all countries and times  the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed  with a few holding most of the wealth  He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern   where N is the number of people with wealth higher than x  and A and m are constants  Over the years  Pareto s Law has proved remarkably close to observed data   The Pareto chart is a special type of histogram  used to view causes of a problem in order of severity from largest to smallest  It is a statistical tool that graphically demonstrates the Pareto principle or the 80–20 rule   Pareto s law concerns the distribution of income   The Pareto distribution is a probability distribution used  among other things  as a mathematical realization of Pareto s law   Ophelimity is a measure of purely economic satisfaction   5  Major works  Vilfredo Pareto  Cours d Économie Politique Professé a l Université de Lausanne  Vol  I  1896  Vol  II  1897   Vilfredo Pareto  Les Systèmes
