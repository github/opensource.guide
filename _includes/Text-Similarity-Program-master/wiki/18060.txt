Leonard Bloomfield  April 1  1887 – April 18  1949  was an American linguist who led the development of structural linguistics in the United States during the 1930s and the 1940s  His influential textbook Language  published in 1933  presented a comprehensive description of American structural linguistics  He made significant contributions to Indo European historical linguistics  the description of Austronesian languages  and description of languages of the Algonquian family   Bloomfield s approach to linguistics was characterized by its emphasis on the scientific basis of linguistics  adherence to behaviorism especially in his later work  and emphasis on formal procedures for the analysis of linguistic data  The influence of Bloomfieldian structural linguistics declined in the late 1950s and 1960s as the theory of Generative Grammar developed by Noam Chomsky came to predominate   1  Early life and education  Bloomfield was born in Chicago  Illinois on April 1  1887 to Jewish parents  His father Sigmund Bloomfield immigrated to the United States as a child in 1868  the original family name Blumenfeld was changed to Bloomfield after their arrival  In 1896 his family moved to Elkhart Lake  Wisconsin  where he attended elementary school  but returned to Chicago for secondary school  His uncle Maurice Bloomfield was a prominent linguist at Johns Hopkins University  and his aunt Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler was a well known concert pianist   Bloomfield attended Harvard College from 1903 to 1906  graduating with the A B  degree  He subsequently began graduate work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison  taking courses in German and Germanic philology  in addition to courses in other Indo European languages  A meeting with Indo Europeanist Eduard Prokosch  a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin  convinced Bloomfield to pursue a career in linguistics  In 1908 Bloomfield moved to the University of Chicago where he took courses in German and Indo European philology with Frances A  Wood and Carl Darling Buck  His doctoral dissertation in Germanic historical linguistics was supervised by Wood  and he graduated in 1909  He undertook further studies at the University of Leipzig and the University of Göttingen in 1913 and 1914 with leading Indo Europeanists August Leskien  Karl Brugmann  as well as Hermann Oldenberg  a specialist in Vedic Sanskrit  Bloomfield also studied at Göttingen with Sanskrit specialist Jacob Wackernagel  and considered both Wackernagel and the Sanskrit grammatical tradition of rigorous grammatical analysis associated with Pāṇini as important influences on both his historical and descriptive work  Further training in Europe was a condition for promotion at the University of Illinois from Instructor to the rank of Assistant Professor   2  Career  Bloomfield was Instructor in German at the University of Cincinnati  1909–1910  Instructor in German at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  1910–1913  Assistant Professor of Comparative Philology and German  also University of Illinois  1913–1921  Professor of German and Linguistics at the Ohio State University  1921–1927  Professor of Germanic Philology at the University of Chicago  1927–1940  Sterling Professor of Linguistics at Yale University  1940 1949  During the summer of 1925 Bloomfield worked as Assistant Ethnologist with the Geological Survey of Canada in the Canadian Department of Mines  undertaking linguistic field work on Plains Cree  this position was arranged by Edward Sapir  who was then Chief of the Division of Anthropology  Victoria Museum  Geological Survey of Canada  Canadian Department of Mines   Bloomfield was one of the founding members of the Linguistic Society of America  In 1924  along with George M  Bolling  Ohio State University  and Edgar Sturtevant  Yale University  he formed a committee to organize the creation of the Society  and drafted the call for the Society s foundation  He contributed the lead article to the inaugural issue of the Society s journal Language  and was President of the Society in 1935  He taught in the Society s summer Linguistic Institute in 1938 1941  with the 1938 1940 Institutes being held in Ann Arbor  Michigan  and the 1941 Institute in Chapel Hill  North Carolina   3  Indo European linguistics  Bloomfield s earliest work was in historical Germanic studies  beginning with his dissertation  and continuing with a number of papers on Indo European and Germanic phonology and morphology  His post doctoral studies in Germany further strengthened his expertise in the Neogrammarian tradition  which still dominated Indo European historical studies  Bloomfield throughout his career  but particularly during his early career  emphasized the Neogrammarian principle of regular sound change as a foundational concept in historical linguistics   Bloomfield s work in Indo European beyond his dissertation was limited to an article on palatal consonants in Sanskrit and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with Pāṇini  in addition to a number of book reviews  Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks  An introduction to language  1914   and his seminal Language  1933   In his textbooks he selected Indo European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change  and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work   a  appropriate data in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed   b  application of the comparative method   c  reconstruction of proto forms  He further emphasized the importance of dialect studies where appropriate  and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige  and the impact of meaning  In addition to regular linguistic change  Bloomfield also allowed for borrowing and analogy   It is argued that Bloomfield s Indo European work had two broad implications   He stated clearly the theoretical bases for Indo European linguistics  and  he established the study of Indo European languages firmly within general linguistics    3 1  Sanskrit studies  As part of his training with leading Indo Europeanists in Germany in 1913 and 1914 Bloomfield studied the Sanskrit grammatical tradition originating with Pāṇini  who lived in northwestern India during the sixth century B C  Pāṇini s grammar is characterized by its extreme thoroughness and explicitness in accounting for Sanskrit linguistic forms  Bloomfield noted that  Pāṇini gives the formation of every inflected  compounded  or derived word  with an exact statement of the sound variations  including accent  and of the meaning   In a letter to Algonquianist Truman Michelson  Bloomfield noted  My models are Pāṇini and the kind of work done in Indo European by my teacher  Professor Wackernagel of Basle    Pāṇini s systematic approach to analysis includes components for   a  forming grammatical rules   b  an inventory of sounds   c  a list of verbal roots organized into sublists  and  d  a list of classes of morphs  Bloomfield s approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook Language reflect the influence of Pāṇini in his treatment of basic concepts such as linguistic form  free form  and others  Similarly  Pāṇini is the source for Bloomfield s use of the terms exocentric and endocentric used to describe compound words  Concepts from Pāṇini are found in Eastern Ojibwa  published posthumously in 1958  in particular his use of the concept of a morphological zero  a morpheme that has no overt realization  Pāṇini s influence is also present in Bloomfield s approach to determining parts of speech  Bloomfield uses the term  form classes   in both Eastern Ojibwa and in the later Menomini language  published posthumously in 1962   4  Austronesian linguistics  While at the University of Illinois Bloomfield undertook research on Tagalog  an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines  He carried out linguistic field work with Alfredo Viola Santiago  who was an engineering student at the university from 1914 to 1917  The results were published as Tagalog texts with grammatical analysis  which includes a series of texts dictated by Santiago in addition to an extensive grammatical description and analysis of every word in the texts  Bloomfield s work on Tagalog  from the beginning of field research to publication  took no more than two years  His study of Tagalog has been described as “…the best treatment of any Austronesian language   The result is a description of Tagalog which has never been surpassed for completeness  accuracy  and wealth of exemplification ”  Bloomfield s only other publication on an Austronesian language was an article on the syntax of Ilocano  based upon research undertaken with a native speaker of Ilocano who was a student at Yale University  This article has been described as a  …tour de force  for it covers in less than seven pages the entire taxonomic syntax of Ilocano    5  Algonquian linguistics  Bloomfield’s work on Algonquian languages had both descriptive and comparative components  He published extensively on four Algonquian languages  Fox  Cree  Menominee  and Ojibwe  publishing grammars  lexicons  and text collections  Bloomfield used the materials collected in his descriptive work to undertake comparative studies leading to the reconstruction of Proto Algonquian  with an early study reconstructing the sound system of Proto Algonqian  and a subsequent more extensive paper refining his phonological analysis and adding extensive historical information on general features of Algonquian grammar   Bloomfield undertook field research on Cree  Menominee  and Ojibwe  and analysed the material in previously published Fox text collections  His first Algonquian research  beginning around 1919  involved study of text collections in the Fox language that had been published by William Jones and Truman Michelson  Working through the texts in these collections  Bloomfield excerpted grammatical information to create a grammatical sketch of Fox  A lexicon of Fox based on his excerpted material was published posthumously   Bloomfield undertook field research on Menominee in the summers of 1920 and 1921  with further brief field research in September 1939 and intermittent visits from Menominee speakers in Chicago in the late 1930s  in addition to correspondence with speakers during the same period  Material collected by Morris Swadesh in 1937 and 1938  often in response to specific queries from Bloomfield  supplemented his information  Significant publications include a collection of texts  a grammar and a lexicon  both published posthumously   in addition to a theoretically significant article on Menomini phonological alternations   Bloomfield undertook field research in 1925 among Plains Cree speakers in Saskatchewan at the Sweet Grass reserve  and also at the Star Blanket reserve  resulting in two volumes of texts and a posthumous lexicon  He also undertook brief field work on Swampy Cree at The Pas  Manitoba  Bloomfield s work on Swampy Cree provided data to support the predictive power of the hypothesis of exceptionless phonological change   Bloomfield s initial research on Ojibwe was through study of texts collected by William Jones  in addition to nineteenth century grammars and dictionaries  During the 1938 Linguistic Society of America Linguistic Institute held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor  Michigan  he taught a field methods class with Andrew Medler  a speaker of the Ottawa dialect who was born in Saginaw  Michigan but spent most of his life on Walpole Island  Ontario  The resulting grammatical description  transcribed sentences  texts  and lexicon were published posthumously in a single volume  In 1941 Bloomfield worked with Ottawa dialect speaker Angeline Williams at the 1941 Linguistic Institute held at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill  North Carolina  resulting in a posthumously published volume of texts   6  Notes  7  References  Despres  Leon M  1987  “My recollections of Leonard Bloomfield ” Robert A  Hall  Jr   ed   Leonard Bloomfield  Essays on his life and work  3 14
