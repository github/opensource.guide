The Kalevala      is a 19th century work of epic poetry compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology   It is regarded as the national epic of Karelia and Finland and is one of the most significant works of Finnish literature  The Kalevala played an instrumental role in the development of the Finnish national identity  the intensification of Finland s language strife and the growing sense of nationality that ultimately led to Finland s independence from Russia in 1917   The first version of The Kalevala  called The new Kalevala  was published in 1835  The version most commonly known today was first published in 1849 and consists of 23 795 verses  divided into fifty songs  Finnish  runot   The title can be interpreted as  The land of Kaleva  or  Kalevia    1  Collection and compilation  1 1  Elias Lönnrot  Elias Lönnrot  9 April 1802 – 19 March 1884  was a physician  botanist and linguist  During the time he was compiling The Kalevala he was the district health officer based in Kajaani responsible for the whole Kainuu region in the eastern part of what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland  He was the son of Fredrik Johan Lönnrot  a tailor and Ulrika Lönnrot  he was born in the village of Sammatti  Uusimaa   At the age of 21  he entered the Imperial Academy of Turku and obtained a Master s degree in 1826  His thesis was entitled De Vainamoine priscorum fennorum numine  Väinämöinen  a Divinity of the Ancient Finns   The monograph s second volume was destroyed in the Great Fire of Turku the same year   In the spring of 1828  he set out with the aim of collecting folk songs and poetry  Rather than continue this work though  he decided to complete his studies and entered Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki to study medicine  He earned a masters degree in 1832  In January 1833  he started as the district health officer of Kainuu and began his work on collecting poetry and compiling The Kalevala  Throughout his career Lönnrot made a total of eleven field trips within a period of fifteen years   Prior to the publication of The Kalevala  Elias Lönnrot compiled several related works including the three part Kantele  1829–1831  the Old Kalevala  1835  and the Kanteletar  1840    Lönnrot s field trips and endeavours not only helped him to compile The Kalevala but also brought considerable enjoyment to the people he visited  he would spend much time retelling what he had collected as well as learning new poems   1 2  Poetry  1 2 1  History  Before the 18th century the Kalevala poetry was common throughout Finland and Karelia  but in the 18th century it began to disappear in Finland  first in western Finland  because European rhymed poetry became more common in Finland  Finnish folk poetry was first written down in the 17th century and collected by hobbyists and scholars through the following centuries  Despite this  the majority of Finnish poetry remained only in the oral tradition   Finnish born nationalist and linguist Kaarle Akseli Gottlund  1796–1875  expressed his desire for a Finnish epic in a similar vein to The Iliad  Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied compiled from the various poems and songs spread over most of Finland  He hoped that such an endeavour would incite a sense of nationality and independence in the native Finnish people  In 1820  Reinhold von Becker founded the journal Turun Wiikko Sanomat  Turku Weekly News  and published three articles entitled Väinämöisestä  Concerning Väinämöinen   These works were an inspiration for Elias Lönnrot in creating his masters thesis at Turku University   In the 19th century  collecting became more extensive  systematic and organised  Altogether  almost half a million pages of verse have been collected and archived by the Finnish Literature Society and other collectors in Estonia and the Republic of Karelia  The publication Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot  Ancient Poems of the Finns  published 33 volumes containing 85 000 items of poetry over a period of 40 years  They have also archived 65 000 items of poetry that remain unpublished  By the end of the 19th century this pastime of collecting material relating to Karelia and the developing orientation towards eastern lands had become a fashion called Karelianism  a form of national romanticism   The chronology of this oral tradition is uncertain  The oldest themes  the origin of Earth  have been interpreted to have their roots in distant  unrecorded history and could be as old as 3 000 years  The newest events  e g  the arrival of Christianity  seem to be from the Iron Age  Finnish folklorist Kaarle Krohn proposes that 20 of the 45 poems of The Kalevala are of possible Ancient Estonian origin or they at least deal with a motif of Estonian origin  of the remainder  two are Ingrian and 23 are Western Finnish    It is understood that during the Finnish reformation in the 16th century the clergy forbade all telling and singing of pagan rites and stories  In conjunction with the arrival of European poetry and music this caused a significant reduction in the number of traditional folk songs and their singers  Thus the tradition faded somewhat but was never totally eradicated   1 2 2  Lönnrot s field trips  In total  Lönnrot made eleven field trips in search of poetry  His first trip was made in 1828 after his graduation from Turku University  but it was not until 1831 and his second field trip that the real work began  By that time he had already published three articles entitled Kantele and had significant notes to build upon  This second trip was not very successful and he was called back to Helsinki to attend to victims of the Second cholera pandemic   The third field trip was much more successful and led Elias Lönnrot to Viena in east Karelia where he visited the town of Akonlahti  which proved most successful  This trip yielded over 3 000 verses and copious notes  In 1833  Lönnrot moved to Kajaani where he was to spend the next 20 years as the district health officer for the region  His fourth field trip was undertaken in conjunction with his work as a doctor  a 10 day jaunt into Viena  This trip resulted in 49 poems and almost 3 000 new lines of verse  It was during this trip that Lönnrot formulated the idea that the poems might represent a wider continuity when poem entities were performed to him along with comments in normal speech connecting them   On the fifth field trip  Lönnrot met Arhippa Perttunen who provided a large portion of the verses for The Kalevala  He also met a singer called Matiska in the hamlet of Lonkka on the Russian side of the border  While this singer had somewhat of a poor memory  he did help to fill in many gaps in the work Lönnrot had already catalogued  This trip resulted in the discovery of almost 300 poems at just over 13 000 verses   In autumn of 1834  Lönnrot had written the vast majority of the work needed for what was to become The Old Kalevala  all that was required was to tie up some narrative loose ends and officially complete the work  His sixth field trip took him into Kuhmo  a municipality in Kainuu to the south of Viena  There he collected over 4 000 verses and completed the first draft of his work  He wrote the foreword and published in February of the following year   With the Old Kalevala now well into its first publication run  Lönnrot decided to continue collecting poems to supplement his existing work and to understand the culture more completely  The seventh field trip took him on a long winding path through the southern and eastern parts of the Viena poem singing region  He was delayed significantly in Kuhmo because of bad skiing conditions  By the end of that trip  Lönnrot had collected another 100 poems consisting of over 4 000 verses  Lönnrot made his eighth field trip to the Russian border town of Lapukka where the great singer Arhippa Perttunen had learned his trade  In correspondence he notes that he has written down many new poems but is unclear on the quantity   Elias Lönnrot departed on the first part of his ninth field trip on 16 September 1836  He was granted a 14 month leave of absence and a sum of travelling expenses from the Finnish Literary Society  His funds came with some stipulations  he must travel around the Kainuu border regions and then on to the north and finally from Kainuu to the south east along the border  For the expedition into the north he was accompanied by Juhana Fredrik Cajan  The first part of the trip took Lönnrot all the way to Inari in northern Lapland  The second  southern part of the journey was more successful than the northern part  taking Lönnrot to the Russian town of Sortavala on Lake Ladoga then back up through Savo and eventually back to Kajaani  Although these trips were long and arduous  they resulted in very little Kalevala material  only 1 000 verses were recovered from the southern half and an unknown quantity from the northern half   The tenth field trip is a relative unknown  What is known however  is that Lönnrot intended to gather poems and songs to compile into the upcoming work Kanteletar  He was accompanied by his friend C  H  Ståhlberg for the majority of the trip  During that journey the pair met Mateli Kuivalatar in the small border town of Ilomantsi  Kuivalatar was very important to the development of the Kanteletar  The eleventh documented field trip was another undertaken in conjunction with his medical work  During the first part of the trip  Lönnrot returned to Akonlahti in Russian Karelia  where he gathered 80 poems and a total of 800 verses  The rest of the trip suffers from poor documentation   1 2 3  Methodology  Lönnrot and his contemporaries  e g  Matthias Castrén  Anders Johan Sjögren and David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus  collected most of the poem variants  one poem could easily have countless variants  scattered across rural areas of Karelia and Ingria  Lönnrot was not really interested in  and rarely wrote down the name of the singer except for some of the more prolific cases  His primary purpose in the region was that of a physician and of an editor  not of a biographer or counsellor  He rarely knew anything in depth about the singer himself and primarily only catalogued verse that could be relevant or of some use in his work   The student David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus is credited with discovering and cataloguing the majority of the Kullervo story   Of the dozens of poem singers who contributed to the Kalevala  significant ones are   Arhippa Perttunen  1769–1840   Juhana Kainulainen  Matiska  Ontrei Malinen  1780–1855   Vaassila Kieleväinen  Soava Trohkimainen  1 2 4  Form and structure  The poetry was often sung to music built on a pentachord  sometimes assisted by a kantele player  The rhythm could vary but the music was arranged in either two or four lines in 5 4 metre  The poems were often performed by a duo  each person singing alternative verses or groups of verses  This method of performance is called an antiphonic performance  it is a kind of  singing match    1 2 4 1  Metre  Despite the vast geographical distance and customary spheres separating individual singers  The Kalevala  as well as the folk poetry it is based on were always sung in the same metre   The Kalevala s metre is a form of trochaic tetrameter that is known as the Kalevala metre  The metre is thought to have originated during the Proto Finnic period  Its syllables fall into three types  strong  weak  and neutral  Its main rules are as follows   A long syllable  one that contains a long vowel or a diphthong  or ends in a consonant  with a main stress is metrically strong   A short syllable with a main stress is metrically weak   All syllables without a main stress are metrically neutral  Neutral syllables can occur at any position  There are two main types of line   A normal tetrameter  word stresses and foot stresses match  and there is a caesura between the second and third feet   A broken tetrameter  Finnish  murrelmasäe  has at least one stressed syllable in a falling position  There is usually no caesura  Traditional poetry in the Kalevala metre uses both types with approximately the same frequency  The alteration of normal and broken tetrameters is a characteristic difference between the Kalevala metre and other forms of trochaic tetrameter   There are also four additional rules   In the first foot  the length of syllables is free  It is also possible for the first foot to contain three or even four syllables   A one syllable word can not occur at the end of a verse   A word with four syllables should not stand in the middle of a verse  This also applies to non compound words   The last syllable of a verse may not include a long vowel   1 2 4 2  Schemes  There are two main schemes featured in The Kalevala   Alliteration  Parallelism The verses are also sometimes inverted into chiasmus   1 2 4 3  Poetry example  Verses 221 to 232 of song forty   1 3  Lönnrot s contribution to Kalevala  Very little is actually known about Elias Lönnrot s personal contributions to The Kalevala  Scholars to this day still argue and hypothesise about how much of The Kalevala is genuine folk poetry and how much is Lönnrot s own work  During the compilation process it is known that he merged poem variants and characters together  left out verses that did not fit and composed lines of his own in order to connect certain passages into a logical plot  Similarly  individual singers used their own words and dialects when reciting their repertoire even going as far as performing different versions of the same song at different times   The Finnish historian Väinö Kaukonen suggests that 3% of The Kalevala s lines are Lönnrot s own composition  as well as 14% being Lönnrot compositions from variants  50% verses which Lönnrot kept mostly unchanged except for some minor alterations and 33% original unedited oral poetry  It is fruitless  however  to attempt to extrapolate concrete percentages of how much of The Kalevala is genuine word for word oral tradition and how much is fabricated by the compiler  A loose collection of mixed and varied poems all with many possible versions cannot be combined into a single and solid epic without some editing  otherwise The Kalevala would be an anthology and not a national epic   1 4  Publishing  The first version of Lönnrot s compilation was entitled Kalewala  taikka Wanhoja Karjalan Runoja Suomen Kansan muinoisista ajoista  The Kalevala  or old Karelian poems about ancient times of the Finnish people   also known as simply the Old Kalevala  was published in two volumes in 1835–1836  The Old Kalevala consisted of 12 078 verses making up a total of thirty two poems   Even after the publication of the Old Kalevala Lönnrot continued to collect new material for several years  He later integrated this additional material with significant edits of the existing material into a second version  The Kalevala  this version was published in 1849  This new Kalevala contains fifty poems  and is the standard text of The Kalevala read and translated to this day   The name Kalevala rarely appears in the original folk poetry of the time and was coined by Lönnrot for the official name of his project sometime at the end of 1834  The first appearance of Kalevala in collected poetry was recorded in the April 1836  The choice of Kalevala as the name for his work was not a random choice however  The name Kalev appears in Finnic and Baltic folklore in many locations and the Sons of Kalev are known throughout Finnish and Estonian folklore   1 4 1  Translations  Of the five complete translations into English  it is only the older translations by John Martin Crawford  1888  and William Forsell Kirby  1907  which attempt to strictly follow the original rhythm  Kalevala meter  of the poems  Eino Friberg s 1988 translation uses it selectively but in general is more tuned to pleasing the ear than being an exact metrical translation also often reducing the length of songs for aesthetic reasons   A notable partial translation of Franz Anton Schiefner s German translation was made by Prof  John Addison Porter in 1868 and published by Leypoldt & Holt   Edward Taylor Fletcher  a British born Canadian literature enthusiast  also translated selections of The Kalevala in 1869  He read them before the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec on 17 March 1869   Francis Peabody Magoun published a scholarly translation of the Kalevala in 1963 written entirely in prose  The appendices of this version contain notes on the history of the poem  comparisons between the original Old Kalevala and the current version  and a detailed glossary of terms and names used in the poem  Magoun also translated The Old Kalevala which was published six years later entitled The Old Kalevala and Certain Antecedents   The two most recent translations were both published in 1989 by Keith Bosley  Oxford University Press  and Eino Friberg  Otava    So far The Kalevala has been translated into sixty one languages and is Finland s most translated work of literature   2  The story  The Kalevala begins with the traditional Finnish creation myth  leading into stories of the creation of the earth  plants  creatures and the sky  Creation  healing  combat and internal story telling are often accomplished by the character s  involved singing of their exploits or desires  Many parts of the stories involve a character hunting or requesting lyrics  spells  to acquire some skill  such as boat building or the mastery of iron making   As well as magical spell casting and singing  there are many stories of lust  romance  kidnapping and seduction  The protagonists of the stories often have to accomplish feats that are unreasonable or impossible which they often fail to achieve leading to tragedy and humiliation   The Sampo is a pivotal element of the whole work  Many actions and their consequences are caused by the Sampo itself or a character s interaction with the Sampo  It is described as a magical talisman or device that brings its possessor great fortune and prosperity  but its precise nature has been the subject of debate to the present day   There are also similarities with mythology and folklore from other cultures  for example the Kullervo character and his story bearing some likeness to the Greek Oedipus  The similarity of the virginal maiden Marjatta to the Christian Virgin Mary is also striking  The arrival of Marjatta s son in the final song spelling the end of Väinämöinen s reign over Kalevala is similar to the arrival of Christianity bringing about the end of Paganism in Finland and Europe at large   2 1  Synopses  2 1 1  The first

Väinämöinen is the central character of The Kalevala  a shamanistic hero with a magical power of song and music  similar to that of Orpheus  He is born of Ilmatar and contributes to the creation of Earth as it is today  Many of his travels resemble shamanistic journeys  most notably one where he visits the belly of a ground giant  Antero Vipunen  to find the songs of boat building   Väinämöinen created and plays the kantele  a Finnish stringed instrument that resembles and is played like a zither   Väinämöinen s search for a wife is a central element in many stories  although he never finds one  One of his potential brides  Joukahainen s sister Aino  drowns herself instead of marrying him  He is the leading member of the group which steals the Sampo from the people of Pohjola   2 2 2  Ilmarinen  Seppo Ilmarinen  is a heroic artificer  comparable to the Germanic Weyland and the Greek Daedalus   He crafted the dome of the sky  the Sampo and various other magical devices featured in The Kalevala  Ilmarinen is the second member of the group who steal the Sampo   Ilmarinen  like Väinämöinen  also has many stories told of his search for a wife  reaching the point where he forges one of gold   2 2 3  Lemminkäinen  Lemminkäinen  a handsome  arrogant and reckless ladies man  is the son of Lempi  English  lust or favourite   He shares a very close relationship with his mother  who revives him after he has been drowned in the river of Tuonela while pursuing the object of his romantic desires  This section of The Kalevala echoes the myth of Osiris  Lemminkäinen is the third member of the group which steals the Sampo from Pohjola   2 2 4  Ukko  Ukko  English  Old man  is the god of sky and thunder  and the leading deity mentioned within The Kalevala  His character corresponds to Thor and Zeus  John Martin Crawford wrote that the name may be related the obsolete Hungarian word for an old man  agg    2 2 5  Joukahainen  Joukahainen is a base  young man who arrogantly challenges Väinämöinen to a singing contest which he loses  In exchange for his life Joukahainen promises his young sister Aino to Väinämöinen  Joukahainen attempts to gain his revenge on Väinämöinen by killing him with a crossbow but only succeeds in killing Väinämöinen s horse  Joukahainen s actions lead to Väinämöinen promising to build a Sampo in return for Louhi rescuing him   2 2 6  Louhi  Louhi  the Mistress of the North  is the shamanistic matriarch of the people of Pohjola  a people rivalling those of Kalevala  She is the cause of much trouble for Kalevala and its people   Louhi at one point saves Väinämöinen s life  She has many daughters whom the heroes of Kalevala make many attempts  some successful  at seducing  Louhi plays a major part in the battle to prevent the heroes of Kalevala from stealing back the Sampo which as a result is ultimately destroyed  She is a powerful witch with a skill almost on a par with that of Väinämöinen s   2 2 7  Kullervo  Kullervo is the vengeful  mentally ill and tragic son of Kalervo  He was abused as a child and sold into slavery to Ilmarinen  He is put to work and treated badly by Ilmarinen s wife whom he later kills  Kullervo is a misguided and troubled youth often at odds with himself and his situation  He often goes into berserk rage and in the end commits suicide   2 2 8  Marjatta  Marjatta is the young virgin of Kalevala  She becomes pregnant from eating a lingonberry  When her labour begins she is expelled from her parents  home and leaves to find a place where she can sauna and give birth  She is turned away from numerous places but finally finds a place in the forest and gives birth to a son  Marjatta s nature  impregnation and searching for a place to give birth are in allegory to the Virgin Mary and the Christianisation of Finland  Marjatta s son is later condemned to death by Väinämöinen for being born out of wedlock  the boy in turn chastises Väinämöinen and is later crowned King of Karelia  This angers Väinämöinen who leaves Kalevala after bequeathing his songs and kantele to the people as his legacy   3  Influence of The Kalevala  The Kalevala is a major part of Finnish culture and history  and has impacted the arts in Finland  and in other cultures around the world   3 1  Daily life  The influence of The Kalevala in daily life and business in Finland is tangible  Names and places associated with The Kalevala have been adopted as company and brand names and even as place names   There are several places within Finland with Kalevala related names  for example  the district of Tapiola in the city of Espoo  the district of Pohjola in the city of Turku  the district of Metsola in the city of Vantaa and the district of Kaleva in the city of Tampere  the historic provinces of Savo and Karjala and the Russian town of Hiitola are all mentioned within the songs of The Kalevala  In addition the Russian town of Ukhta was in 1963 renamed Kalevala and in the United States a small community founded in 1900 by Finnish immigrants is named Kaleva  Michigan and many of the street names are taken from the Kalevala   The banking sector of Finland has had at least three Kalevala related brands  Sampo  name changed to Danske Bank in late 2012   Pohjola and Tapiola   The jewellery company Kalevala Koru was founded in 1935 on the 100th anniversary of the publication of The Old Kalevala  It specialises in the production of unique and culturally important items of jewellery  It is co owned by the Kalevala Women s League and offers artistic scholarships to a certain number of organisations and individuals every year   The Finnish dairy company Valio has a brand of ice cream named Aino  specialising in more exotic flavours than their normal brand   The construction group Lemminkäinen was formed in 1910 as a roofing and asphalt company  the name was chosen specifically to emphasise that they were a wholly Finnish company  They now operate internationally   3 2  Celebration  The Kalevala Day is celebrated in Finland on 28 February  to match Elias Lönnrot s first version of The Kalevala in 1835  It is on the same day as the Finnish Culture Day   Several of the names in The Kalevala are also celebrated as Finnish name days  The name days themselves and the dates they fall upon have no direct relationship with The Kalevala itself  however  the adoption of the names became commonplace after the release of The Kalevala   3 3  Fine art  Several artists have been influenced by The Kalevala  most notably Akseli Gallen Kallela who has painted many pieces relating to The Kalevala   Iittala group s Arabia brand kilned a series of Kalevala commemorative plates  designed by the late Raija Uosikkinen  1923–2004   The series ran from 1976 to 1999 and are highly sought after collectables   One of the earliest artists to depict a scene from The Kalevala is Robert Wilhelm Ekman  One of his drawings from 1886 depicts Väinämöinen playing his kantele   In 1989  the fourth full translation of Kalevala into English was published  richly illustrated by Björn Landström   3 4  Literature  The Kalevala has been translated over one

Kalevala  The Kalevala  as the important work of national literature it is  has of course attracted many scholars and enthusiasts to interpret its contents in a historical context  Many interpretations of the themes in The Kalevala have been tabled  Some parts of the epic have been perceived as ancient conflicts between the early Finns and the Samis  In this context  the country of Kalevala could be understood as Southern Finland and Pohjola as Lapland   However  the place names in Kalevala seem to transfer the Kalevala further south  which has been interpreted as reflecting the Finnic settlement expansion from the South that came to push the Samis further to the north  Some scholars locate the lands of Kalevala to East Karelia  where most of the Kalevala stories were written down  In 1961 a small town of Uhtua in the then Soviet Republic of Karelia was renamed Kalevala  perhaps to promote that theory   Finnish politician and linguist Eemil Nestor Setälä rejected the idea that the heroes of Kalevala are historical in nature and suggested they are personifications of natural phenomena  He interprets Pohjola as the northern heavens and the Sampo as the pillar of the world  Setälä suggests that the journey to regain the Sampo is a purely imaginary one with the heroes riding a mythological boat or magical steed to the heavens   The practice of bear worship  arctolatry  was once very common in Finland and there are strong echoes of this in The Kalevala   The old Finnish word väinä  a strait of deep water with a slow current  appears to be the origin of the name Väinämöinen  one of Väinämöinen s other names is Suvantolainen  suvanto being the modern word for väinä  Consequently it is possible that the Saari  Island  might be the island of Saaremaa in Estonia and Kalevala the Estonian mainland   Finnish folklorists Matti Kuusi and Pertti Anttonen state that terms such as the people of Kalevala or the tribe of Kalevala were fabricated by Elias Lönnrot  Moreover  they contend that the word Kalevala is very rare in traditional poetry and that by emphasizing dualism  Kalevala vs  Pohjola  Elias Lönnrot created the required tension that made The Kalevala dramatically successful and thus fit for a national epic of the time   5  See also  Finnish mythology  Kalevipoeg  Kaleva  Michigan Many of the street names from this small Michigan  USA  village were taken from the Kalevala   6  References  7  Further reading  7 1  Translations  The Kalevala  The Epic Poem of Finland  translation by John Martin Crawford  ISBN 0 7661 8938 4  Text at
