WordNet is a lexical database for the English language  It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets  provides short definitions and usage examples  and records a number of relations among these synonym sets or their members  WordNet can thus be seen as a combination of dictionary and thesaurus  While it is accessible to human users via a web browser  its primary use is in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications  The database and software tools have been released under a BSD style license and are freely available for download from the WordNet website  Both the lexicographic data  lexicographer files  and the compiler  called grind  for producing the distributed database are available   1  History and team members  WordNet was created in the Cognitive Science Laboratory of Princeton University under the direction of psychology professor George Armitage Miller starting in 1985 and has been directed in recent years by Christiane Fellbaum  The project received funding from government agencies including the National Science Foundation  DARPA  the Disruptive Technology Office  formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity   and REFLEX  George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum were awarded the 2006 Antonio Zampolli Prize for their work with WordNet   2  Database contents  As of November 2012 WordNet s latest Online version is 3 1  The database contains 155 287 words organized in 117 659 synsets for a total of 206 941 word sense pairs  in compressed form  it is about 12 megabytes in size   WordNet includes the lexical categories nouns  verbs  adjectives and adverbs but ignores prepositions  determiners and other function words   Words from the same lexical category that are roughly synonymous are grouped into synsets  Synsets include simplex words as well as collocations like  eat out  and  car pool   The different senses of a polysemous word form are assigned to different synsets  The meaning of a synset is further clarified with a short defining gloss and one or more usage examples  An example adjective synset is   All synsets are connected to other synsets by means of semantic relations  These relations  which are not all shared by all lexical categories  include   Nouns  hypernyms  Y is a hypernym of X if every X is a  kind of  Y  canine is a hypernym of dog   hyponyms  Y is a hyponym of X if every Y is a  kind of  X  dog is a hyponym of canine   coordinate terms  Y is a coordinate term of X if X and Y share a hypernym  wolf is a coordinate term of dog  and dog is a coordinate term of wolf   meronym  Y is a meronym of X if Y is a part of X  window is a meronym of building   holonym  Y is a holonym of X if X is a part of Y  building is a holonym of window   Verbs  hypernym  the verb Y is a hypernym of the verb X if the activity X is a  kind of  Y  to perceive is an hypernym of to listen   troponym  the verb Y is a troponym of the verb X if the activity Y is doing X in some manner  to lisp is a troponym of to talk   entailment  the verb Y is entailed by X if by doing X you must be doing Y  to sleep is entailed by to snore   coordinate terms  those verbs sharing a common hypernym  to lisp and to yell  These semantic relations hold among all members of the linked synsets  Individual synset members  words  can also be connected with lexical relations  For example   one sense of  the noun  director  is linked to  one sense of  the verb  direct  from which it is derived via a  morphosemantic  link   The morphology functions of the software distributed with the database try to deduce the lemma or stem form of a word from the user s input  Irregular forms are stored in a list  and looking up  ate  will return  eat   for example   3  Knowledge structure  Both nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies  defined by hypernym or IS A relationships  For instance  one sense of the word dog is found following hypernym hierarchy  the words at the same level represent synset members  Each set of synonyms has a unique index   At the top level  these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner  trees  for nouns and 15 for verbs  calledlexicographic files at a maintenance level   All are linked to a unique beginner synset   entity   Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies  Adjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees  Instead  two  central  antonyms such as  hot  and  cold  form binary poles  while  satellite  synonyms such as  steaming  and  chilly  connect to their respective poles via a  similarity  relations  The adjectives can be visualized in this way as  dumbbells  rather than as  trees    4  Psycholinguistic aspects of WordNet  The initial goal of the WordNet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s  Psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic  hierarchical fashion  Retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to  traverse  to access the knowledge  Thus  speakers could more quickly verify that canaries can sing because a canary is a songbird   sing  is a property stored on the same level as  canary    but required slightly more time to verify that canaries can fly  where they had to access the concept  bird  on the superordinate level  and even more time to verify canaries have skin  requiring look up across multiple levels of hyponymy  up to  animal    While such experiments and the underlying theories have been subject to criticism  some of WordNet s organization is consistent with experimental evidence  For example  anomic aphasia  selectively affects speakers  ability to produce words from a specific semantic category  a WordNet hierarchy  Antonymous adjectives  WordNet s central adjectives in the dumbbell structure  are found to co occur far more frequently than chance  a fact that has been found to hold for many languages   5  WordNet as a lexical ontology  WordNet is sometimes called an ontology  a persistent attribute that its creators do not make  The hypernym hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories  In other words  WordNet can be interpreted and used as a lexical ontology in the computer science sense  However  such an ontology should normally be corrected before being used since it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies such as  i  the existence of common specializations for exclusive categories and  ii  redundancies in the specialization hierarchy  Furthermore  transforming WordNet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve  i  distinguishing the specialization relations into subtypeOf and instanceOf relations  and  ii  associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category  Although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part of the integration of WordNet 1 7 into the cooperatively updatable knowledge base of WebKB 2   typically  knowledge oriented information retrieval  simply re use it directly  WordNet has also been converted to a formal specification  by means of a hybrid bottom up top down methodology to automatically extract association relations from WordNet  and interpret these associations in terms of a set of conceptual relations  formally defined in the DOLCE foundational ontology   In most works that claim to have integrated WordNet into ontologies  the content of WordNet has not simply been corrected when it seemed necessary  instead  WordNet has been heavily re interpreted and updated whenever suitable  This was the case when  for example  the top level ontology of WordNet was re structured according to the OntoClean based approach or when WordNet was used as a primary source for constructing the lower classes of the SENSUS ontology   6  Limitations  WordNet does not include information about the etymology or the pronunciation of words and it contains only limited information about usage  WordNet aims to cover most of everyday English and does not include much domain specific terminology   WordNet is the most commonly used computational lexicon of English for word sense disambiguation  WSD   a task aimed to assigning the context appropriate meanings  i e  synset members  to words in a text  However  it has been argued that WordNet encodes sense distinctions that are too fine grained  This issue prevents WSD systems from achieving a level of performance comparable to that of humans  who do not always agree when confronted with the task of selecting a sense from a dictionary that matches a word in a context  The granularity issue has been tackled by proposing clustering methods that automatically group together similar senses of the same word   6 1  Licensed vs  Open WordNets  Some wordnets were subsequently created for other languages  A 2012 survey lists the wordnets and their availability In an effort to propagate the usage of WordNets  the Global WordNet community had been slowly re licensing their WordNets to an open domain where researchers and developers can easily access and use WordNets as language resources to provide ontological and lexical knowledge in Natural Language Processing tasks   The Open Multilingual WordNet provides access to open licensed wordnets in a variety of languages  all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English  PWN   The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages   7  Applications  WordNet has been used for a number of different purposes in information systems  including word sense disambiguation  information retrieval  automatic text classification  automatic text summarization  machine translation and even automatic crossword puzzle generation   A common use of WordNet is to determine the similarity between words  Various algorithms have been proposed  and these include measuring the distance among the words and synsets in WordNet s graph structure  such as by counting the number of edges among synsets  The intuition is that the closer two words or synsets are  the closer their meaning  A number of WordNet based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a Perl package called WordNet  Similarity  and in a Python package called NLTK  Other more sophisticated WordNet based similarity techniques include ADW  whose is available in Java  WordNet can also be used to inter link other vocabularies   8  Interfaces  Princeton maintains a list of related projects that includes links to some of the widely used application programming interfaces available for accessing WordNet using various programming languages and environments   9  Related projects and extensions  WordNet is connected to several databases of the Semantic Web  WordNet is also commonly re used via mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies  Most often  only the top level categories of WordNet are mapped   9 1  Global WordNet Association  The Global WordNet Association  GWA  is a public and non commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing  sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world  The GWA also promotes the standardization of wordnets across different languages to ensure its uniformity in enumerating the different synsets in human languages  The GWA keeps a list of
