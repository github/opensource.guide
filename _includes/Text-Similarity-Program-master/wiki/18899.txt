Mendelevium is a synthetic element with chemical symbol Md  formerly Mv  and atomic number 101  A metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series  it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements  It is the antepenultimate actinide and the ninth transuranic element  It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles  A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known  the most stable being 258Md with a half life of 51 days  nevertheless  the shorter lived 256Md  half life 1 27 hours  is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale   Mendelevium was discovered by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955  the same method still used to produce it today  It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev  father of the periodic table of the chemical elements  Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium 253  over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour  The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides  with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state  Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half lives  there are currently no uses for it outside of basic scientific research   1  Discovery  Mendelevium was the ninth transuranic element to be synthesized  It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso  Glenn T  Seaborg  Gregory R  Choppin  Bernard G  Harvey  and team leader Stanley G  Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California  Berkeley  The team produced 256Md  half life of 87 minutes  when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting of only a billion  109  einsteinium atoms with alpha particles  helium nuclei  in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory s 60 inch cyclotron  thus increasing the target s atomic number by two  256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time  In total  seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced  This discovery was part of a program  begun in 1952  that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides  This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements  neutron capture  could not work because of a lack of beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element  mendelevium  and also due to the very short half life to spontaneous fission of fermium 258 that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process   To predict if the production of mendelevium would be possible  the team made use of a rough calculation  The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to the product of the number of atoms of target material  the target s cross section  the ion beam intensity  and the time of bombardment  this last factor was related to the half life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half life  This gave one atom per experiment  Thus under optimum conditions  the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected  This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment  The target material  einsteinium 253  could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium  one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms  and its three week half life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target  However  it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second  Seaborg applied for the necessary funds   While Seaborg applied for funding  Harvey worked on the einsteinium target  while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation  Choppin suggested using α hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms from those of the lighter actinides  The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique  introduced by Albert Ghiorso  In this technique  the einsteinium was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam  so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold  This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique  developed by Alfred Chetham Strode  This technique gave a very high yield  which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material  The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil  It was bombarded by 41 MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0 05 cm2  The target was cooled by water or liquid helium  and the foil could be replaced   Initial experiments were carried out in September 1954  No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms  thus  Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events  The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955   On the day of discovery  19 February  alpha irradiation of the einsteinium target occurred in three three hour sessions  The cyclotron was in the University of California campus  while the Radiation Laboratory was on the next hill  To deal with this situation  a complex procedure was used  Ghiorso took the catcher foils  there were three targets and three foils  from the cyclotron to Harvey  who would use aqua regia to dissolve it and pass it through an anion exchange resin column to separate out the transuranium elements from the gold and other products  The resultant drops entered a test tube  which Choppin and Ghiorso took in a car to get to the Radiation Laboratory as soon as possible  There Thompson and Choppin used a cation exchange resin column and the α hydroxyisobutyric acid  The solution drops were collected on platinum disks and dried under heat lamps  The three disks were expected to contain respectively the fermium  no new elements  and the mendelevium  Finally  they were placed in their own counters  which were connected to recorders such that spontaneous fission events would be recorded as huge deflections in a graph showing the number and time of the decays  There thus was no direct detection  but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron capture daughter 256Fm  The first one was identified with a  hooray  followed by a  double hooray  and a  triple hooray   The fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the 101st element  mendelevium  In total  five decays were reported up till 4 a m  Seaborg was notified and the team left to sleep  Additional analysis and further experimentation showed the produced mendelevium isotope to have mass 256 and to decay by electron capture to fermium 256 with a half life of 1 5 h   Being the first of the second hundred of the chemical elements  it was decided that the element would be named  mendelevium  after the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev  father of the periodic table  Due to the fact that this discovery came during the Cold War  Seaborg had to request permission of the government of the United States to propose that the element be named for a Russian  but it was granted  The name  mendelevium  was accepted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry  IUPAC  in 1955 with symbol  Mv   which was changed to  Md  in the next IUPAC General Assembly  Paris  1957    2  Characteristics  2 1  Physical  In the periodic table  mendelevium is located to the right of the actinide fermium  to the left of the actinide nobelium  and below the lanthanide thulium  Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities  and bulk preparation is currently impossible  Nevertheless  a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties   The lanthanides and actinides  in the metallic state  can exist as either divalent  such as europium and ytterbium  or trivalent  most other lanthanides  metals  The former have fnd1s2 configurations  whereas the latter have fn+1s2 configurations  In 1975  Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the cohesive energies  enthalpies of crystallization  of the metallic lanthanides and actinides  both as divalent and trivalent metals  The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the  Rn 5f126d17s2 configuration over the  Rn 5f137s2 configuration for mendelevium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d  as is true also for the very late actinides  thus einsteinium  fermium  mendelevium  and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals  The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons  which increases with increasing atomic number  Thermochromatographic studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by Zvara and Hübener from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction  In 1990  Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 134 and 142 kJ·mol−1  Divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around  194 ± 10  pm  Mendelevium s melting point has been estimated at 827 °C  the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium   2 2  Chemical  The chemistry of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution  in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states  The +1 state has also been reported  but has not yet been confirmed   Before mendelevium s discovery  Seaborg and Katz predicted that it should be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides  After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955  these predictions were confirmed  first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation exchange column of resin  and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts  Cation exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide  fermium  Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1 2 cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid  DCTA    In reducing conditions  mendelevium III  can be easily reduced to mendelevium II   which is stable in aqueous solution  The standard reduction potential of the E° Md3+→Md2+  couple has been variously estimated as −0 10 V or −0 20 V  In comparison  E° Md3+→Md0  should be around −1 74 V  and E° Md2+→Md0  should be around −2 5 V  Mendelevium II  s elution behavior has been compared with that of strontium II  and europium II    In 1973  mendelevium I  was reported to have been produced by Russian scientists  who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium II   It was found to be stable in neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium I   However  later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium I  and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced  not like the monovalent alkali metals  Nevertheless  the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides  and concluded that mendelevium I  had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements  thus cocrystallizing with them  The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative   Although E° Md4+→Md3+  was predicted in 1975 to be +5 4 V  suggesting that mendelevium III  could be easily oxidized to mendelevium IV   1967 experiments with the strong oxidizing agent sodium bismuthate were unable to oxidize mendelevium III  to mendelevium IV    2 3  Atomic  A mendelevium atom has 101 electrons  of which at least three  and perhaps four  can act as valence electrons  They are expected to be arranged in the configuration  Rn 5f137s2  ground state term symbol 2F7 2   although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006  In forming compounds  three valence electrons may be lost  leaving behind a  Rn 5f12 core  this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their  Rn  5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state  The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most  6 58 ± 0 07  eV in 1974  based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones  this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium s scarcity and high radioactivity  The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91 2 pm  1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89 6 pm  as well as an enthalpy of hydration of − 3654 ± 12  kJ·mol−1  Md2+ should have an ionic radius of 115 pm and hydration enthalpy −1413 kJ·mol−1  Md+ should have ionic radius 117 pm   2 4  Isotopes  Sixteen isotopes of mendelevium are known  with mass numbers from 245 to 260  all are radioactive  Additionally  five nuclear isomers are known  245mMd  247mMd  249mMd  254mMd  and 258mMd  Of these  the longest lived isotope is 258Md with a half life of 51 5 days  and the longest lived isomer is 258mMd with a half life of 58 0 minutes  Nevertheless  the slightly shorter lived 256Md  half life 1 27 hours  is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium  After 258Md  the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are 260Md with a half life of 31 8 days  257Md with a half life of 5 52 hours  259Md with a half life of 1 60 hours  and 256Md with a half life of 1 27 hours  All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half lives that are less than an hour  and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 5 minutes   The half lives of mendelevium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards  reaching a maximum at 258Md  Experiments and predictions suggest that the half lives will then decrease  apart from 260Md with a half life of 31 8 days  as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long lived nuclei in the actinide series   Mendelevium 256  the chemically most important isotope of mendelevium  decays through electron capture 90 7% of the time and alpha decay 9 9% of the time  It is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron capture daughter fermium 256  but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission  alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium 256  7 205 and 7 139 MeV  can provide more useful identification   3  Production and isolation  The lightest mendelevium isotopes  245Md to 247Md  are mostly produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions  while slightly heavier ones  248Md to 253Md  are produced by bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen  The most important and most stable isotopes are in the range from 254Md to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles  einsteinium 253   254  and  255 can all be used  259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No  and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium 254 and oxygen 18  Typically  the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium 253 or  254 with alpha particles  einsteinium 254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half life and therefore can be used as a target for longer  Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium  femtogram quantities of mendelevium 256 may be produced   The recoil momentum of the produced mendelevium 256 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the einsteinium target from which they are produced  bringing them onto a thin foil of metal  usually beryllium  aluminium  platinum  or gold  just behind the target in a vacuum  This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation  which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target  The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere  frequently helium   and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along  Using a long capillary tube  and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas  the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined  The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride  then using a cation exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid  acting as an eluant  However  if the foil is made of gold and thin enough  it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion exchange chromatography  the eluant being 6 M hydrochloric acid   Mendelevium can finally be separated from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation exchange resin column  the eluant being ammonia α HIB  Using the gas jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary  The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements   Another possible way to separate the trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis  2 ethylhexyl  phosphoric acid  abbreviated as HDEHP  as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase  The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation exchange resin column  so that the heavier actinides elute later  The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column  the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence  after fermium   Another method to isolate mendelevium exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ from those of Es3+ and Fm3+  The initial steps are the same as above  and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography  but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride  Then  50 mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0 1 M hydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury  The solvent extraction then proceeds  and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column  mendelevium II  does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid  It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2 M hydrochloric acid  to remove impurities  including chromium  and finally 6 M hydrochloric acid  to remove the mendelevium   It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam  using 1 M hydrochloric acid as an eluant  reducing Md III  to Md II  where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals  Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate  the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile   4
