North America is a continent wholly within the Northern Hemisphere and almost wholly within the Western Hemisphere  It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas  It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean  to the east by the Atlantic Ocean  to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean  and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea   North America covers an area of about 24 709 000 square kilometers  9 540 000 square miles   about 4 8% of the planet s surface or about 16 5% of its land area  As of 2013  its population was estimated at nearly 565 million people across 23 independent states  representing about 7 5% of the human population  Most of the continent s land area is dominated by Canada  the United States  Greenland  and Mexico  while smaller states exist in the Central American and Caribbean regions  North America is the third largest continent by area  following Asia and Africa  and the fourth by population after Asia  Africa  and Europe   The first people to live in North America were Paleoindians who began to arrive during the last glacial period by crossing the Bering land bridge  They differentiated into a number of diverse cultures and communities across the continent  The largest and most advanced Pre Columbian civilizations in North America were the Aztecs in what is now Mexico and the Maya in Central America  European colonists began to arrive starting in the 16th and 17th centuries  wiping out large numbers of the native populations and beginning an era of European dominance   1  Etymology  The Americas are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by the German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann  Vespucci  who explored South America between 1497 and 1502  was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the East Indies  but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans  In 1507  Waldseemüller produced a world map  in which he placed the word  America  on the continent of South America  in the middle of what is today Brazil  He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio    from Americus the discoverer     as if it were the land of Americus  thus America   For Waldseemüller  no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer  He used the Latinized version of Vespucci s name  Americus Vespucius   but in its feminine form  America   following the examples of  Europa  and  Asia    Later  when other mapmakers added North America  they extended the original name to it as well  in 1538  Gerard Mercator used the name America to all of the Western Hemisphere on his world map   Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from  Amerigo Vespucci  could be problematic  Ricardo Palma  1949  proposed a derivation from the  Amerrique  mountains of Central America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the Amerrique mountains of Central America  which connected his discoveries to those of Christopher Columbus   Alfred E  Hudd proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named Richard Amerike from Bristol  who is believed to have financed John Cabot s voyage of discovery from England to Newfoundland in 1497  A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient Visigothic name of  Amairick   Another is that the name is rooted in a Native American language   2  History  2 1  Geologic history  Laurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America  it formed between 1 5 to 1 0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon  The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton  From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras  North America was joined with the other modern day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea  with Eurasia to its east  One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains  which formed some 480 million years ago  making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world  When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago  North America became part of Laurasia  before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid Cretaceous period  The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny  between 80 and 55 million years ago  The formation of the Isthmus of Panama connected the continent to South America about three million years ago  and the Great Lakes  as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers  were carved by receding glaciers about 10 000 years ago   North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods  The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country  According to paleontologist Peter Dodson  this is primarily due to stratigraphy  climate and geography  human resources  and history  Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent  The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western United States   2 2  Pre Columbian  Anthropologists have a number of models explaining the origins of the early human population of North America  The indigenous peoples of North America have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation  The consensus is that indigenous North Americans first arrived from Asia during the last Ice Age  most likely through the Bering Land Bridge and possibly by primitive boats also   Before contact with Europeans  the natives of North America were divided into many different polities  from small bands of a few families to large empires  They lived in several  culture areas   which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones and give a good indication of the main lifeway or occupation of the people who lived there  e g   the bison hunters of the Great Plains  or the farmers of Mesoamerica   Native groups can also be classified by their language family  e g   Athapascan or Uto Aztecan   Peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture  nor were they always allies  Anthropologists think that the Inuit people of the high Arctic came to North America much later than other native groups  as evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record  and their replacement by the Thule people  It is possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlers  The best known evidence that supports this theory is Kennewick Man   During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent  cultures changed and shifted  One of the oldest cultures yet found is the Clovis culture of modern New Mexico  Later cultures include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures  found in the Mississippi river valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners  The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world  such as tomatoes and squash  Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world s major staples  maize  corn    As a result of the development of agriculture in the south  many important cultural advances were made there  For example  the Maya civilization developed a writing system  built huge pyramids and temples  had a complex calendar  and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE  a few hundred years after the Mesopotamians  The Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish explorers arrived  but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico  The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés   2 3  Post Columbian  During the Age of Discovery  Europeans began exploring and staking claims in various parts of North America  Upon their arrival in the  New World   the Native American population declined substantially  primarily due to the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity  as well as violent conflicts  Native peoples found their culture changed drastically  As such  their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well  several linguistic groups went extinct  and others changed quite quickly  The names and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before  or the ones in use today   Britain  Spain  and France fought over and established extensive territories in North America  In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th  several independence movements started across the continent  which would create its modern countries  The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic coast declared independence in 1776  becoming the United States of America  Canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by Britain and France  New Spain  a territory that stretched from modern day southern US to Central America  declared independence in 1810  becoming the First Mexican Empire  In 1823 the former Captaincy General of Guatemala  then part of the Mexican Empire  became the first independent state in Central America  officially changing its name to the United Provinces of Central America   3  Geography and extent  North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World  the Western Hemisphere  the Americas  or simply America  which  less commonly  is considered by some as a single continent with North America a subcontinent   North America s only land connection to South America is at the Isthmus of Panama  The continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the Darién watershed along the Colombia Panama border  placing all of Panama within North America  Alternatively  some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec  Mexico  with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point  The Caribbean islands  or West Indies  are considered part of North America   Before the Central American isthmus was raised  the region had been underwater  The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge  which had connected North America and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela  The continental coastline is long and irregular  The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent  followed by the Hudson Bay  Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California   There are numerous islands off the continent s coasts  principally  the Arctic Archipelago  the Bahamas  Turks & Caicos  the Greater and Lesser Antilles  the Aleutian Islands  some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper   the Alexander Archipelago  the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast  and Newfoundland  Greenland  a self governing Danish island  and the world s largest  is on the same tectonic plate  the North American Plate  and is part of North America geographically  In a geologic sense  Bermuda is not part of the Americas  but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the Mid Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago  The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras  North Carolina  However  Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America  especially given its historical  political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent  The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate  Parts of western Mexico  including Baja California  and of California  including the cities of San Diego  Los Angeles and part of San Francisco  lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate  with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas fault  The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate  whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border the North American Plate on its western frontier   The continent can be divided into four great regions  each of which contains many subregions   the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic  the geologically young  mountainous west  including the Rocky Mountains  the Great Basin  California and Alaska  the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast  and the varied eastern region  which includes the Appalachian Mountains  the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard  and the Florida peninsula  Mexico  with its long plateaus and cordilleras  falls largely in the western region  although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf   The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California  Oregon  Washington  and British Columbia  with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low lying deserts—in between  The highest peak is Denali in Alaska   The states that the geographic center of North America is  6 miles west of Balta  Pierce County  North Dakota  at approximately   approximately from Rugby  North Dakota  The USGS further states that  No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 States  the conterminous United States  or the North American continent   Nonetheless  there is a field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center  The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located from the nearest coastline  between Allen and Kyle  South Dakota at    4  Demographics  The prevalent languages in North America are English  Spanish  and French  The term Anglo America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas  namely Canada  where English and French are co official  and the United States  but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics  especially the Commonwealth Caribbean  Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas  generally south of the United States  where the Romance languages  derived from Latin  of Spanish and Portuguese  but French speaking countries are not usually included  predominate  the other republics of Central America  but not always Belize   part of the Caribbean  not the Dutch   English   or French speaking areas   Mexico  and most of South America  except Guyana  Suriname  French Guiana  FR   and the Falkland Islands  UK     The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions  Canada is officially bilingual  French is the official language of the Province of Quebec  where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language  and it is co official with English in the Province of New Brunswick  Other French speaking locales include the Province of Ontario  the official language is English  but there are an estimated 600 000 Franco Ontarians   the Province of Manitoba  co official as de jure with English   the French West Indies and Saint Pierre et Miquelon  as well as the US state of Louisiana  where French is also an official language  Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French  Similarly  French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English   Economically  Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations in the continent  followed by Mexico  a newly industrialized country  The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development  For example  small Caribbean island nations  such as Barbados  Trinidad and Tobago  and Antigua and Barbuda  have a higher GDP  PPP  per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations  Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations   Demographically  North America is a racially and ethnically diverse continent  Its three main racial groups are Caucasians  Mestizos and Blacks  There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups   Socially and culturally  North America presents a well defined entity  Canada and the United States have a similar culture and similar traditions as a result of both countries being former British colonies  A common cultural and economic market has developed between the two nations because of the strong economic and historical ties  Spanish speaking North America shares a common past as former Spanish colonies  In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the Maya developed  indigenous people preserve traditions across modern boundaries  Central American and Spanish speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity   Northern Mexico  particularly in the cities of Monterrey  Tijuana  Ciudad Juárez  and Mexicali  is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the United States  Of the aforementioned cities  Monterrey has been regarded as the most Americanized city in North America  Immigration to the United States and Canada remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the US  The Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region  and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America  In the Anglophone Caribbean this influence is partly due to the relatively small populations  less than 200 000  of the majority of English speaking Caribbean countries  and the fact that many of these countries now have expatriate diasporas living abroad that are larger than those remaining at home   4 1  Populace  The most populous country in North America  over doubling the second largest country in population  is the United States with 318 4 million persons  The second largest country  and only other country to maintain a populace above 100 million persons is Mexico with a population of 112 322 757  Canada is the third largest country with a population of 32 623 490  The majority of Caribbean island nations have national populations under one million  though Cuba  Dominican Republic  Haiti  Puerto Rico  a territory of the United States   Jamaica  and Trinidad and Tobago have populations higher than one million   While the United States  Canada  and Mexico maintain the largest populations  large city populations are not restricted to those nations  There are also large cities in the Caribbean  The largest cities in North America  by far  are Mexico City and New York  These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million  and two of three in the Americas  Next in size are Los Angeles  Toronto  Chicago  Havana  Santo Domingo  and Montreal  Cities in the sunbelt regions of the United States  such as those in Southern California and Houston  Phoenix  Miami  Atlanta  and Las Vegas  are experiencing rapid growth  These causes included warm temperatures  retirement of Baby Boomers  large industry  and the influx of immigrants  Cities near the United States border  particularly in Mexico  are also experiencing large amounts of growth  Most notable is Tijuana  a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia  Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America  they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages   Eight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the United States  These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5 5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area  Los Angeles metropolitan area  Chicago metropolitan area  and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex  Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the United States  Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America  Greater Mexico City  Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million citizens  The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada   United States border and Mexico   United States border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas  These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large commercial  economic  and cultural activity  The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight  In Detroit Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion   The North America continent has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas  In the United States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions  These are the Arizona Sun Corridor  Cascadia  Florida  Front Range  Great Lakes Megaregion  Gulf Coast Megaregion  Northeast  Northern California  Piedmont Atlantic  Southern California  and the Texas Triangle  Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions  These include the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor  Golden Horseshoe – both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megaregion – and megalopolis of Central Mexico  Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston Washington  D C  Corridor  or the Northeast  as the region is one massive contiguous area  Yet megaregion criterion have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region  being home to 53 768 125 people in 2000   The top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as of 2013  based on national census numbers from the United States of America  and census estimates from Canada and Mexico   舄†2011 Census figures   5  Geology  5 1  Canadian geology  Geologically  Canada is one of the oldest regions in the world  with more than half of the region consisting of precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era  Canada s mineral resources are diverse and extensive  Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron  nickel  zinc  copper  gold  lead  molybdenum  and uranium reserves  Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic  making Canada one of the world s largest producers  Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals  The largest  and best known  is Sudbury  Ontario  Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater  The nearby  but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin  Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin  and so it could be a second metal rich impact crater  The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry   5 2  US geological provinces  The lower 48 US states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces   The American cordillera   The Canadian Shield   The stable platform   The coastal plain   The Appalachian orogenic belt  The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera  while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot   5 3  Central American geology  Central America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time  In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake  killing 23 000 people  Managua  the capital of Nicaragua  was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972  the last one killing about 5 000 people  three earthquakes devastated El Salvador  one in 1986 and two in 2001  one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009  killing at least 34 people  in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009   Volcanic eruptions are common in the region  In 1968 the Arenal Volcano  in Costa Rica  erupted and killed 87 people  Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas   Central America has many mountain ranges  the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas  the Cordillera Isabelia  and the Cordillera de Talamanca  Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people  in fact  most of the population of Honduras  Costa Rica  and Guatemala live in valleys  Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee  beans  and other crops   6  Economy  Canada  Mexico and the United States have significant and multifaceted economic systems  The United States has the largest economy in North America  and in the world  In 2014  the US had an estimated per capita gross domestic product  PPP  of $54 980  and is the most technologically developed economy in North America  The United States  services sector comprises 76 7% of the country s GDP  estimated in 2010   industry comprises 22 2% and agriculture comprises 1 2%  Canada s economic trends are similar to that of the United States  with significant growth in the sectors of services  mining and manufacturing  Canada s per capita GDP  PPP  was estimated at $44 656 and it had the 11th largest GDP  nominal  in 2014  Canada s services sector comprises 78% of the country s GDP  estimated in 2010   industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%  Mexico has a per capita GDP  PPP  of $16 111 and as of 2014 is the 15th largest GDP  nominal  in the world  Being a newly industrialized country  Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations  Its main sources of income are oil  industrial exports  manufactured goods  electronics  heavy industry  automobiles  construction  food  banking and financial services   The North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas  These areas are the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Caribbean Community and Common Market  CARICOM   and the Central American Common Market  CACM   Of these trade blocs  the United States takes part in two  In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free trade relations  often between the larger  more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries   The North America Free Trade Agreement forms one of the four largest trade blocs in the world  Its implementation in 1994 allowed for strong economic cooperation with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between the three northern nations  While Canada and the United States already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship – and to present day still do – in the world and Canada   United States trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs  NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty free trade  The free trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on United States Mexico trade  Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010  surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all time historical increase of 24 3% or US$791 billion  The NAFTA trade bloc GDP  PPP  is the world s largest with US$17 617 trillion  This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the United States is the world s largest national economy  the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14 7 trillion in 2010  The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other s largest trade partners  The United States is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico  while Canada and Mexico are each other s third largest trade partners   The Caribbean trade bloc – CARICOM – came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations  As of 2000  CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion  CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations  In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on Free Trade Agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations  OTN  free trade agreements have been signed into effect   Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961  this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation  Recent implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  has left the future of the CACM unclear  The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries  the Dominican Republic  and the United States  The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA  In addition to the United States  Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs  Currently under proposal  the Canada – Central American Free Trade Agreement  CA4  would operate much the same as CAFTA with the United States does   North American nations also take part in inter continental trade blocs  Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU  The United States has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union  the US Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself  and the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations  Australia  and New Zealand   7  Infrastructure  The Pan American Highway route in North America is the portion of a network of roads nearly in length which travels through the mainland nations of the Americas  No definitive length of the Pan American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan American Highway  and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border  However  the total length of the North American portion of the highway is roughly    The First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was built across North America in the 1860s  linking the railroad network of the eastern US with California on the Pacific coast  Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous Golden spike event at Promontory Summit  Utah  it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West  catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system  Although an accomplishment  it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world  The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway  GTR  had  by 1867  already accumulated more than of track by connecting Portland  Maine  and the three northern New England states with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron  Michigan  through Sarnia  Ontario   Many of the nations of North America cooperate on a shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan  NANP  which is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories  the United States and its territories  Canada  Bermuda  and 17 Caribbean nations   8  Regions  Geographically the North American continent is composed of many regions and subregions  These included regions formed by cultural  economic  and geographic standards  Economic regions included those formed by trade blocs  among notable inclusions  the North American Trade Agreement bloc and Central American Trade Agreement  Linguistically and culturally  the continent could be divided into Anglo America and Latin America  Anglo America includes most of Northern America  Belize  and Caribbean islands with English speaking populations  though sub national entities  such as Louisiana and Quebec  are Francophone in composition    The southern North American continent is often recognized as being composed of two regions  These recognized regions are Central America and the Caribbean  The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well  In contrast to the common definition of  North America   that which encompasses the whole continent  the term  North America  is also used to refer to Canada  Mexico  the United States  and Greenland   The term Northern America  originating in reference to the northern most countries and territories of North America  is used in reference to Canada  the United States  Greenland  Bermuda  and St  Pierre and Miquelon  Although rarely used  the term Middle America—not to be confused with the Midwestern United States—groups the regions of Central America  the Caribbean  and Mexico   The largest countries of the continent  Canada and the United States  also maintain well defined and recognized regions  In the case of Canada these are the British Columbia Coast  Canadian Prairies  Central Canada  Atlantic Canada  and Northern Canada  These regions also maintain numerous subregions  In the case of the United States – and in accordance with the US Census Bureau definitions – these regions are  New England  Mid Atlantic  East North Central States  West North Central States  South Atlantic States  East South Central States  West South Central States  Mountain States  and Pacific States  Regions shared between both nations included the Great Lakes Region  Megalopolises have also formed between both nations in the case of the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes Megaregion   9  Countries  territories  and dependencies  Below is a table of North American countries and territories divided into three basic regions   10  Usage of the term  The term North America maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context  In English  North America may be used to refer to the United States and Canada together  Alternatively  usage sometimes includes Greenland and Mexico  as in the North American Free Trade Agreement   as well as offshore islands   In Ibero America and other parts of Europe  North America usually designates a subcontinent of the Americas containing Canada  the United States  and Mexico  and often Greenland  Saint Pierre et Miquelon  and Bermuda   North America has been historically referred to by other names  Spanish North America  New Spain  was often referred to as Northern America  and this was the first official name given to Mexico   Outside North America  going into the twentieth century  the whole American continent  North  Central  and South America as well as the Caribbean  was referred to simply as  America  or  The Americas   one of the  Five Continents   the other four being Africa  Europe  Asia  and Oceania
