Nawaf Muhammed Salim al Hazmi      also known as Rabia al Makki   August 9  1976 – September 11  2001  was a Saudi citizen and one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77  which they crashed into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks in the United States   Hazmi and a longtime friend  Khalid al Mihdhar  left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the Bosnian War  Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance  He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999   Already long time affiliates of Al Qaeda with extensive fighting experience  Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States  Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999  Hazmi trained in an Al Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999  He traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit   Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles  California from Bangkok  Thailand  on January 15  2000  with Khalid al Mihdhar  The two settled in San Diego  staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000  While in San Diego  they attended its mosque  led by Anwar Al Awlaki  The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego  Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar s poor English skills  they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious   Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000  Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000  and they both traveled to Phoenix  Arizona  They later moved to Falls Church  Virginia in April 2001  where the rest of the hijackers began to join them  Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta  the ringleader of the attacks  during the summer of 2001   The CIA reportedly received Hazmi s name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future  Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain  A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced  but they were not located until after the attacks   On September 10  2001  Hazmi  along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon  Virginia  The next morning  Hazmi and four other terrorists  boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks  The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon  Hazmi was initially dismissed as a  muscle hijacker  following the attacks  but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed  His younger brother  Salem al Hazmi  was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight   1  Background  Nawaf was born in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al Hazmi  a grocer  He traveled to Afghanistan as a teenager in 1993  CNN s preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed  He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child  He never told me why  but he had a long knife scar on his forearm   and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in Jizan   In 1995  he and his childhood friend  Khalid al Mihdhar  joined a group that went to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War  Afterwards  Nawaf returned to Afghanistan along with his brother Salem  and Mihdhar  In Afghanistan  they fought alongside the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance  and joined up with Al Qaeda  Nawaf al Hazmi returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999   2  Selected for the 9 11 plot  Osama bin Laden held Hazmi and Mihdhar in high respect  with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere  Al Qaeda later referred to Hazmi as Mihdhar s  Second in command   When Bin Laden committed to the  planes operation  plot in spring 1999  Bin Laden personally selected Hazmi and Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers  In addition to Hazmi and Mihdhar  two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot  which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States  Known as Rabi ah al Makki during the preparations  Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the United States  he already had a US visa when Bin Laden selected him  Hazmi obtained a B 1 B 2 tourist visa on April 3  1999 from the US consulate in Jeddah  Saudi Arabia  using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier  Hazmi s passport did have indicators of Al Qaeda association  but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those   In the autumn of 1999  these four attended the Mes Aynak training camp in Afghanistan  which provided advanced training  Hazmi went with the two Yemenis  Tawfiq bin Attash  Khallad  and Abu Bara al Yemeni  to Karachi  Pakistan where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  the plot s coordinator  instructed him on western culture  travel  as well as taught some basic English phrases  Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi  but instead left for Yemen  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting  Before leaving for Malaysia  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored Hazmi s Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan  and make it appear that Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via Dubai   After the attacks  the Associated Press would re publish a  bizarre  story by the Cody Enterprise that quoted witnesses stating that Nawaf entered the United States during the autumn of 1999  crossing along the Canadian border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local high school in Cody  Wyoming  Leaving the city 45 minutes later with the remaining cardboard boxes  the men allegedly asked  how to get to Florida    2 1  Malaysia summit  Based on information uncovered by the FBI in the 1998 United States embassy bombings case  the National Security Agency  NSA  began tracking the communications of Mihdhar s father in law Ahmad Muhammad Ali al Hada  who was facilitating al Qaeda communications  in 1999  Authorities also became aware of Hazmi  as a friend and associate of Mihdhar  Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with Al Qaeda  and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997  He also said that he revealed this to the CIA  saying  What we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al Qaeda  in both the    The CIA strongly denies having received any such warning   In late 1999 the NSA informed the CIA of an upcoming meeting in Malaysia  which Hada mentioned would involve  Khalid    Nawaf   and  Salem   On January 5  Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur  where he met up with Mihdhar  Attash  and Abu Bara  The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit  during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged  At this time  there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot  but Bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States  Ramzi bin al Shibh was also at the summit  and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed possibly attended the summit  In Malaysia  the group stayed with Yazid Sufaat  a local member of Jemaah Islamiyah  who provided accommodations at request of Hambali  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities  who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA  Malaysian authorities reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Tawfiq bin Attash  one of the Yemenis  and others who were later involved in the USS Cole bombing  Hazmi and Mihdhar also met with Fahd al Quso  who was later involved in the USS Cole bombing  After the meeting  Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to Bangkok in Thailand on January 8  and left a week later on January 15 to travel to the United States   3  In the United States  3 1  Enters the United States with Mihdhar  On January 15  2000  Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived together at Los Angeles International Airport from Bangkok  and were admitted for a six month period  Immediately after entering the country  Nawaf and Mihdhar met Omar al Bayoumi in an airport restaurant  Bayoumi claims he was merely being charitable in helping the two seemingly out of place Muslims to move to San Diego where he helped them find an apartment near his own  co signed their lease  and gave them $1500 to help pay their rent   While in San Diego  witnesses told the FBI he and Mindhar had a close relationship with Anwar Al Awlaki  an imam who served as their spiritual advisor  Authorities say the two regularly attended the Masjid Ar Ribat al Islami mosque Awlaki led in San Diego  and Awlaki had many closed door meetings with them  which led investigators to believe Awlaki knew about the 9 11 attacks in advance  Hazmi got a recommendation from the mosque for a job at a nearby Texaco station and car wash  a business whose former owner  a Muslim  was known to help young men in need of work  For a month  Hazmi worked there two days a week  vacuuming and drying cars  In the beginning of February 2000  Mihdhar and Hazmi rented an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments  a 175 unit complex in the Clairemont Mesa section of San Diego  near the Balboa Drive Mosque  In February  Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 Toyota Corolla  While living at the Parkwood Apartments  neighbors thought that Mihdhar and Hazmi were odd  Months passed without them getting any furniture for the apartment  Instead  the men slept on mattresses on the floor  yet they carried briefcases  were frequently on their mobile phones  and were occasionally picked up by a limousine  After the attacks  their neighbors told the media that the pair constantly played flight simulator games  Residents said a total of four men spent time together at Parkwood  playing in the pool like children   On April 4  2000  Hazmi took a one hour introductory flight lesson at the National Air College in San Diego  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi took flight lessons in May 2000 at the Sorbi Flying Club  located at Montgomery Field in San Diego  On May 5  Hazmi and Mihdhar took a lesson for one hour  and additional lessons on May 10 at the Sorbi Flying Club  with Hazmi flying an aircraft for 30 minutes  However  their English skills were very poor  and they did not do well with flight lessons  The first day that they showed up  they told instructors that they wanted to learn how to fly Boeings  Mihdhar and Hazmi raised some suspicion when they offered extra money to their flight instructor  Richard Garza  if he would train them to fly jets  Suspicious of the two men  Garza refused the offer but did not report them to authorities  Garza described the two men as  impatient students  who  wanted to learn to fly jets  specifically Boeings    Adel Rafeea received a wire transfer of $5000  on April 18  from Ali Abdul Aziz Ali in the UAE  which he later claimed was money Nawaf had asked him to accept on his behalf   At the end of May 2000  Hazmi and Mihdhar moved out of Parkwood Apartments  and moved to nearby Lemon Grove  California  At this time  Mihdhar transferred his vehicle s registration to Hazmi  and he left San Diego on June 10  2000  Mihdhar returned to Yemen  which angered Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  who did not want Hazmi to be left alone in California   On July 12  2000  Hazmi filed for an extension of his visa  which was due to expire  His visa was extended until January 2001  though Hazmi never filed any further requests to extend it beyond that   In September  Nawaf and Mihdhar both moved into the house of FBI informant Abdussattar Shaikh  although he did not report the pair as suspicious  Mihdhar is believed to have left the apartment in early October  less than two weeks before the USS Cole Bombing  Nawaf continued living with Shaikh until December   Hani Hanjour arrived in San Diego in early December 2000  joining Hazmi  but on December 10  they were seen leaving their Mount Vernon address leaving for Phoenix  Arizona where Hanjour could take refresher flight training  On December 12  they arrived at Mesa AZ and stayed with Mourad Jdaaini and Mike Khalaf  On December 22  Hanjour and Hazmi signed a lease for an apartment in the Indian Springs Village complex in Mesa  Arizona  moving in on January 9   3 2  2001  In March al Hazmi received a shipment of VHS videos including videos about Boeing 747 and 777 flight decks and “how an airline captain should look and act  and later a road atlas  map of NYC and a World aeronautical chart   On March 30  Al Hazmi notified his utility company that he might be moving to another state or Saudi Arabia  He and Hanjour moved out before the apartment rental expired at the end of the month on their way to Virginia  2 days later on April 1  2001  Oklahoma police officer C  L  Parkins pulled Hazmi over for speeding in their Corolla along with an additional citation for failing to use a seatbelt together totaling $138  A routine inspection of his California drivers license turned up no warrants or alerts  although his name was known to both the NSA and the CIA as a suspected terrorist   Anwar al Awlaki had already headed east and served as Imam at the Dar al Hijrah mosque in the metropolitan Washington  DC area starting in January 2001  Shortly after this  his sermons were attended by three of the 9 11 hijackers  the new one being Hanjour    By April 3  he was likely with companion Hani Hanjour when he was recorded at an ATM in Front Royal  Virginia  arriving in Falls Church  Virginia  by April 4  They met a man believed to be a Jordanian named Eyad Alrababah at a 7 11 that day  The 9 11 commission wrote that Hazmi and Hanjour met Alrababah at the Dar al Hijra mosque who was computer technician who had moved from West Paterson  New Jersey and was there to ask imam Anwar al Awlaki about finding a job  He helped the pair rent an apartment in Alexandria where they moved in   The September 11 Commission concluded that two of the hijackers  reportedly respected Awlaki as a religious figure   When police raided the Hamburg  Germany  apartment of Ramzi bin al Shibh  the  20th hijacker   while investigating the 9 11 attacks  his telephone number was found among bin al Shibh s personal contact information   On May 1  2001  Hazmi reported to police that men tried to take his wallet outside his Fairfax  Virginia residence  but before the county officer left  Hazmi signed a  statement of release  indicating he did not want the incident investigated   In May 2001  Nidal Hasan s mother s funeral was held at the Falls Church mosque  although it is not known if al Hazmi attended the service  May 2  two other hijackers  Ahmed al Ghamdi and Majed Moqed  arrived in Virginia and moved in with them  On May 8  Alrababah suggested that al Hazmi and al Mihdhar move with him to Fairfield  Connecticut and helped all four hijackers move to a hotel there  They called area flight schools and after a few days Alrababah drove the four to Paterson  New Jersey to show them around  Some FBI agents suspected that Awlaki gave Alrababah the job of helping Hazmi and Hanjour  Alrababah was later arrested as a witness convicted after 9 11 in a fraudulent driver’s license scheme and deported to Jordan   On May 21  Al Hazmi moved in with Hanjour into an apartment in Paterson New Jersey  Mohammed Atta is living in the same city at another location   On June 30  Al Hazmi s car was involved in a minor traffic accident on the east bound George Washington Bridge  On June 25  2001  Hazmi obtained a drivers  license in Florida  providing an address in Delray Beach  Florida  and he obtained a USA ID card on July 10  On August 2  Hazmi also obtained a Virginia drivers  license  and made a request for it to be reissued on September 7   Hazmi  along with at least five other future hijackers  traveled to Las Vegas  Nevada at least six times in the summer of 2001  They reportedly drank alcohol  gambled  and paid strippers to perform lap dances for them   Throughout the summer  Hazmi met with leader Mohammad Atta to discuss the status of the operation of a monthly basis   On August 23  Israeli Mossad reportedly gives his name to the CIA as part of a list of 19 names they say are planning an attack in the near future  Only four of the names are known for certain – Nawaf  Atta  Marwan and Mihdhar  but again  the connection was not made with previous contacts with local law enforcement  On the same day  he is added to an INS watch list  together with Mihdhar to prevent entry into the US   An internal review after 9 11 found that  everything was done  to find them  that could have been done   But the search does not appear to have been particularly aggressive  A national motor vehicle index was reportedly checked  but Hazmi s speeding ticket was not detected for some reason  The FBI did not search credit card databases  bank account databases  or car registration  all of which would have produced positive results  Hazmi was even listed in the 2000–2001 San Diego phone book  but this too was not searched until after the attacks  He had not been placed on terrorist watch lists  nor did the CIA or NSA alert the FBI  Customs and Immigration  or local police and enforcement agencies   On August 27  brothers Nawaf and Salem purchased flight tickets through Travelocity com using Nawaf s Visa card   On September 1  Nawaf registered Room #7 at the Pin Del Motel in Laurel  Maryland  On the registration  he listed his driver s license number as 3402142 D  and gave a New York hotel as his permanent residence  Ziad Jarrah had checked into the hotel on August 27   Nawaf and Mihdhar purchased their 9 11 plane tickets online using a credit card with their real names  This raised no red flags  since the FAA had not been informed that the two were on a terrorist watchlist   4  Attacks  On September 10  2001  Hanjour  Mihdhar  and Nawaf checked into the Marriott Residence Inn in Herndon  Virginia where Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen  a prominent Saudi government official  was staying – although no evidence was ever uncovered that they had met  or knew of each other s presence   On September 11  Hazmi board American Airlines Flight 77  The flight was scheduled to depart at 08 10  but ended up departing 10 minutes late from Gate D26 at Dulles  The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08 50 51  At 08 54  Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal  assigned flight path and turned south  and then hijackers set the flight s autopilot heading for Washington  D C  Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband  United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson  and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives  At 09 37  American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon  killing all 64 aboard  including the hijackers   along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon   5  Aftermath  Nawaf al Hazmi s 1988 blue Toyota Corolla was found on the next day in Dulles International Airport s hourly parking lot  Inside the vehicle  authorities found a letter written by Mohamed Atta  maps of Washington  D C  and New York City  a cashier s check made out to a Phoenix flight school  four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit  a box cutter  and a page with notes and phone numbers   In the recovery process at the Pentagon  remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination  as not matching any DNA samples for the victims  and put into custody of the FBI  Forensics teams confirmed that it seemed two of the hijackers were brothers  based on their DNA similarities   Several weeks after the attacks  a Las Vegas Days Inn employee went to the FBI and stated that she recognized Hazmi s photographs from the media as being a man she had met at the hotel  who had asked for details on hotels near Los Angeles  She admitted that he never gave his name   6  Timeline in America  Late in 2005  Army Lt  Col  Kevin Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project Able Danger had kept Nawaf  Khalid al Mihdhar  Mohamed Atta and Marwan al Shehhi all under surveillance as Al Qaeda agents   January 15  2000  Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar arrive in Los Angeles from Bangkok  Thailand   February 2000  Hazmi and Mihdhar move to San Diego   Autumn 2000  Hamzi works at a gas station while living in San Diego   March 2001
