Thomas Henry Huxley    4 May 1825 – 29 June 1895  was an English biologist  comparative anatomist   known as  Darwin s Bulldog  for his advocacy of Charles Darwin s theory of evolution   Huxley s famous debate in 1860 with Samuel Wilberforce was a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career  Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day  but  after an encounter with Robert Chambers  the author of Vestiges  he changed his mind and decided to join the debate  Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen  against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes   Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin s ideas  such as gradualism  and was undecided about natural selection  but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin  Instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain  he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition   In 1869 Huxley coined the term  agnostic  to describe his uncertainty of whether or not a god exists  Use of that term has continued to the present day  see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism    Huxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self taught  He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the latter 19th century  He worked on invertebrates  clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood  Later  he worked on vertebrates  especially on the relationship between apes and humans  After comparing Archaeopteryx with Compsognathus  he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs  a theory widely accepted today   The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution  and by his extensive public work on scientific education  both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere   1  Biography  1 1  Early life  Thomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing  then a village in Middlesex  He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers  Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as Alfred Russel Wallace  Huxley was brought up in a literate middle class family which had fallen on hard times  His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed  putting the family into financial difficulties  As a result  Thomas left school at age 10  after only two years of formal schooling   Despite this unenviable start  Huxley was determined to educate himself  He became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century  At first he read Thomas Carlyle  James Hutton s Geology  and Hamilton s Logic  In his teens he taught himself German  eventually becoming fluent and used by Charles Darwin as a translator of scientific material in German  He learned Latin  and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original   Later on  as a young adult  he made himself an expert  first on invertebrates  and later on vertebrates  all self taught  He was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates  In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than most of his clerical opponents  Huxley  a boy who left school at ten  became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain   He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners  at 13 to his brother in law John Cooke in Coventry  who passed him on to Thomas Chandler  notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes  Chandler s practice was in London s Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor  Here Thomas would have seen poverty  crime and rampant disease at its worst  Next  another brother in law took him on  John Salt  his eldest sister s husband  Now 16  Huxley entered Sydenham College  behind University College Hospital   a cut price anatomy school whose founder  Marshall Hall  discovered the reflex arc  All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading  which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling   A year later  buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the Apothecaries  yearly competition  Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital  where he obtained a small scholarship  At Charing Cross  he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones  Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London  Jones had been Robert Knox s assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare  The young Wharton Jones  who acted as go between  was exonerated of crime  but thought it best to leave Scotland  He was a fine teacher  up to date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon  In 1845  under Wharton Jones  guidance  Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs  a layer that has been known since as Huxley s layer  No doubt remembering this  and of course knowing his merit  later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor   At twenty he passed his First M B  examination at the University of London  winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology  However  he did not present himself for the final  Second M B   exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree  His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy   1 2  Voyage of the Rattlesnake  Aged 20  Huxley was too young to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise  yet he was  deep in debt   So  at a friend s suggestion  he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy  He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy  Sir William Burnett  the Physician General of the Navy  interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence  by means of a viva voce    Finally Huxley was made Assistant Surgeon   surgeon s mate   to HMS Rattlesnake  about to start for a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia  The Rattlesnake left England on 3 December 1846 and  once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere  Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates  He began to send details of his discoveries back to England  where publication was arranged by Edward Forbes FRS  who had also been a pupil of Knox   Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley   Huxley s paper  On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae  was published in 1849 by the Royal Society in its Philosophical Transactions  Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of Hydrozoa  The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers  enclosing a central cavity or stomach  This is characteristic of the phylum now called the Cnidaria  He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals  When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates  Huxley was able to summarise this work in The Oceanic Hydrozoa  published by the Ray Society in 1859   The value of Huxley s work was recognised and  on returning to England in 1850  he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society  In the following year  at the age of twenty six  he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council  He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall  who remained his lifelong friends  The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant surgeon  so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the Rattlesnake  He solved the problem of Appendicularia  whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter Müller had found himself wholly unable to assign  It and the Ascidians are both  as Huxley showed  tunicates  today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum Chordata  Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy  The Rattlesnake s official naturalist  John MacGillivray  did some work on botany  and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages  He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format   1 3  Later life  Huxley effectively resigned from the navy  by refusing to return to active service  and  in July 1854  he became Professor of Natural History at the Royal School of Mines and naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year  In addition  he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855–58 and 1865–67  Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863–69  President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869–1870  President of the Royal Society 1883–85  Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85  and President of the Marine Biological Association 1884–1890   The thirty one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life  Huxley retired in 1885  after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884  He resigned the Presidency of the Royal Society in mid term  the Inspectorship of Fisheries  and his chair  as soon as he decently could  and took six month s leave  His pension was a fairly handsome £1500 a year   In 1890  he moved from London to Eastbourne where he edited the nine volumes of his Collected Essays  In 1894 he heard of Eugene Dubois  discovery in Java of the remains of Pithecanthropus erectus  now known as Homo erectus   Finally  in 1895  he died of a heart attack  after contracting influenza and pneumonia   and was buried in North London at St Marylebone  This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved youngest son Noel  who died of scarlet fever in 1860  Huxley s wife Henrietta Anne née Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there  No invitations were sent out  but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony  they included Hooker  Flower  Foster  Lankester  Joseph Lister and  apparently  Henry James   Huxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons   Noel Huxley  1856–1860   died aged 4  Jessie Oriana Huxley  1856–1927   married architect Fred Waller in 1877  Marian Huxley  1859–1887  married artist John Collier in 1879  Leonard Huxley  1860–1933   married Julia Arnold  Rachel Huxley  1862–1934  married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884  Henrietta  Nettie  Huxley  1863–1940   married Harold Roller  travelled Europe as a singer  Henry Huxley  1865–1946   became a fashionable general practitioner in London  Ethel Huxley  1866–1941  married artist John Collier  widower of sister  in 1889   Two daughters of Huxley and his wife  Ethel  1859   188  and Marian  1866   1941  were consecutively married to John Collier  the Pre Raphaelite painter   1 3 1  Public duties and awards  From 1870 onwards  Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty  He served on eight Royal Commissions  from 1862 to 1884  From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the Royal Society and from 1883–85 he was President  He was President of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870  In 1870  he was President of the British Association at Liverpool and  in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board  He was President of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879  He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society  persuaded government about science  and established scientific education in British schools and universities  Before him  science was mostly a gentleman s occupation  after him  science was a profession   He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science  The Royal Society  who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25  1851   awarded him the Royal Medal the next year  1852   a year before Charles Darwin got the same award  He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition  Then later in life came the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894  the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876  the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890  There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies  these and his many academic awards are listed in the Life and Letters  He turned down many other appointments  notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College  Oxford   In 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley  Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the Polar Star  they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain  Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies  academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany   As recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state  and was appointed Privy Councillor in 1892   Despite his many achievements he was given no award by the British state until late in life  In this he did better than Darwin  who got no award of any kind from the state   Darwin s proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisors  including Wilberforce  Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours  or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment—he had vigorous debates in print with Benjamin Disraeli  William Ewart Gladstone and Arthur Balfour  and his relationship with Lord Salisbury was less than tranquil   Huxley was for about thirty years evolution s most effective advocate  and for some Huxley was  the premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century  for  the whole English speaking world    Though he had many admirers and disciples  his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership  He had  directly or indirectly  guided the careers and appointments of the next generation  but none were of his stature  The loss of Francis Balfour in 1882  climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge  was a tragedy  Huxley thought he was  the only man who can carry out my work   the deaths of Balfour and W  K  Clifford were  the greatest losses to science in our time    1 3 2  Vertebrate palaeontology  The first half of Huxley s career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for  persistent types   in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement  in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants  was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic  In the same vein  he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era  and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct   Much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea  Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%  and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved  Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin s more fluid ideas  despite his intelligence  it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution  However  gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology  and the discipline itself  developed   Huxley s detailed anatomical work was  as always  first rate and productive  His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach  whereas pre Darwinian naturalists collected  identified and classified  Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups   The lobed finned fish  such as coelacanths and lung fish  have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone  the humerus or femur  His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods  one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology   The study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles  which he united under the title of Sauropsida  His papers on Archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are   Apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate  and had descended from the same stock as the apes  Huxley did little work on mammals  with one exception  On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses  discovered by O  C  Marsh  in Yale s Peabody Museum  Marsh was part palaeontologist  part robber baron  a man who had hunted buffalo and met Red Cloud  in 1874   Funded by his uncle George Peabody  Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries  the huge Cretaceous aquatic bird Hesperornis  and the dinosaur footprints along the Connecticut River were worth the trip by themselves  but the horse fossils were really special  The collection at that time went from the small four toed forest dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse  By looking at their teeth he could see that  as the size grew larger and the toes reduced  the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer  All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland  And  we now know  that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene  the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction  see Paleocene Eocene thermal maximum   The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members  and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line   The horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual  and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America  not in Eurasia  If so  then something must have happened to horses in North America  since none were there when Europeans arrived  The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin s gradualism  and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series   2  Darwin s bulldog  Huxley was originally not persuaded of  development theory  as evolution was once called  We can see that in his savage review of Robert Chambers  Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation  a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution  Huxley had also rejected Lamarck s theory of transmutation  on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it  All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution  which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley s mind  It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends  but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley  who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man   Huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin s ideas before they were published  the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell   The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection  which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin s notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray  Huxley s famous response to the idea of natural selection was  How extremely stupid not to have thought of that   However  the correctness of natural selection as the main mechanism for evolution was to lie permanently in Huxley s mental pending tray  He never conclusively made up his mind about it  though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis   Logically speaking  the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all  It is to this question that much of Charles Darwin s The Origin of Species was devoted  Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin s way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book s publication   Huxley s support started with his anonymous favourable review of the Origin in the Times for 26 December 1859  and continued with articles in several periodicals  and in a lecture at the Royal Institution in February 1860  At the same time  Richard Owen  whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the Origin in the Edinburgh Review  also primed Samuel Wilberforce who wrote one in the Quarterly Review  running to 17 000 words  The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce s son wrote his biography  So it can be said that  just as Darwin groomed Huxley  so Owen groomed Wilberforce  and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves  Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate  we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the Quarterly    I am Darwin s bulldog  said Huxley  and it is apt  the second half of Darwin s life was lived mainly within his family  and the younger  combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large  A letter from THH to Ernst Haeckel  2 November 1871  goes  The dogs have been snapping at  Darwin s  heels too much of late   At Oxford and Cambridge Universities   Bulldog  was and still is student slang for a university policeman  whose job was to corral errant students and maintain their moral rectitude   2 1  Debate with Wilberforce  Famously  Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the British Association meeting  on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum  Huxley s presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers  the Scottish publisher and author of  Vestiges   who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state  and begged for assistance  The debate followed the presentation of a paper by John William Draper  and was chaired by Darwins s former botany tutor John Stevens Henslow  Darwin s theory was opposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford  Samuel Wilberforce  and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends Hooker and Lubbock  The platform featured Brodie and Professor Beale  and Robert FitzRoy  who had been captain of HMS Beagle during Darwin s voyage  spoke against Darwin   Wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B A  meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers  Vestiges  For the more challenging task of opposing the Origin  and the implication that man descended from apes  he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen – Owen stayed with him the night before the debate  On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his Quarterly Review article  written but not yet published   then ventured onto slippery ground  His famous jibe at Huxley  as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother s side or his father s side  was probably unplanned  and certainly unwise  Huxley s reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play   The letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eye witness account of the debate  and written less than a month afterwards  Other eyewitnesses  with one or two exceptions  Hooker especially thought he had made the best points   give similar accounts  at varying dates after the event  The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well  In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly  Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin  a letter which does not survive  however  a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event   One effect of the debate was to increase hugely Huxley s visibility amongst educated people  through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals  Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate  a lesson he never forgot  A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed  on the contrary  they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority  A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science  with its implied need for scientific education  A fifth consequence was indirect  as Wilberforce had feared  a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament  especially the Book of Genesis  Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate  they were supporters  perhaps  of the controversial Essays and Reviews  Thus both on the side of science  and on the side of religion  the debate was important  and its outcome significant   see also below   That Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate  and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education  says something about both men  whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled   2 1 1  Man s place in nature  For nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes  This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen  a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability  The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen  Huxley s Croonian Lecture  delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull was the start  In this  he rejected Owen s theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous  an opinion previously held by Goethe and Lorenz Oken   From 1860–63 Huxley developed his ideas  presenting them in lectures to working men  students and the general public  followed by publication  Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets  later bound up as a little green book  the first copies went on sale in December  Other lectures grew into Huxley s most famous work Evidence as to Man s place in Nature  1863  where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871   Although Darwin did not publish his Descent of Man until 1871  the general debate on this topic had started years before  there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between Monboddo and Buffon   Darwin had dropped a hint when  in the conclusion to the Origin  he wrote   In the distant future    light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history   Not so distant  as it turned out  A key event had already occurred in 1857 when Richard Owen presented  to the Linnean Society  his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus Homo  Having reached this opinion  Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own  No other biologist held such an extreme view  Darwin reacted  Man   as distinct from a chimpanzee  as  an ape from a platypus    I cannot swallow that   Neither could Huxley  who was able to demonstrate that Owen s idea was completely wrong   The subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting  when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen  and promised a later demonstration of the facts  In fact  a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces  In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B A  Huxley s friend William Flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures  the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor  were indeed present in apes  The debate was widely publicised  and parodied as the Great Hippocampus Question  It was seen as one of Owen s greatest blunders  revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate  but also a better anatomist   Owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes  but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size   Huxley s ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue  new series  of his own journal  the Natural History Review   the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed   This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of Man s Place in Nature  with an addendum giving his account of the Owen Huxley controversy about the ape brain  In his Collected Essays this addendum was removed   The extended argument on the ape brain  partly in debate and partly in print  backed by dissections and demonstrations  was a landmark in Huxley s career  It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy  and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce  It also marked the start of Owen s decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists   The following was written by Huxley to Rolleston before the BA meeting in 1861   During those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology  In 1862 he examined the Neanderthal skull cap  which had been discovered in 1857  It was the first pre sapiens discovery of a fossil man  and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large   Perhaps less productive was his work on physical anthropology  a topic which fascinated the Victorians  Huxley classified the human races into nine categories  and discussed them under four headings as  Australoid  Negroid  Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types  Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics   2 1 2  Natural selection  Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin  As shown in every biography  they had quite different and rather complementary characters  Important also  Darwin was a field naturalist  but Huxley was an anatomist  so there was a difference in their experience of nature  Lastly  Darwin s views on science were different from Huxley s views  For Darwin  natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations  it solved problems  Huxley  on the other hand  was an empiricist who trusted what he could see  and some things are not easily seen  With this in mind  one can appreciate the debate between them  Darwin writing his letters  Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right   Huxley s reservations on natural selection were of the type  until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other  natural selection cannot be proved   Huxley s position on selection was agnostic  yet he gave no credence to any other theory   Darwin s part in the discussion came mostly in letters  as was his wont  along the lines   The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms  and in any event unnecessary  It s the same as asking to see every step in the transformation  or the splitting  of one species into another  My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved  no other theory does nearly so well    Huxley s reservation  as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked  was contagious   it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism   One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent  but not the question of mechanism   2 1 3  Pallbearer  Huxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin on 26 April 1882   3  The X Club  In November 1864 Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club  the X Club  like minded people working to advance the cause of science  not surprisingly  the club consisted of most of his closest friends  There were nine members  who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more  The members were  Huxley  John Tyndall  J  D  Hooker  John Lubbock  banker  biologist and neighbour of Darwin   Herbert Spencer  social philosopher and sub editor of the Economist   William Spottiswoode  mathematician and the Queen s Printer   Thomas Hirst  Professor of Physics at University College London   Edward Frankland  the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution  and George Busk  zoologist and palaeontologist  formerly surgeon for HMS Dreadnought   All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society  Tyndall was a particularly close friend  for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day  On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter s trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology   There were also some quite significant X Club satellites such as William Flower and George Rolleston   Huxley protegés   and liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley  the Dean of Westminster  Guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time   They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel  planning what to do  high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business  It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening  First item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin  which they managed after quite a struggle   The next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas  This was the weekly Reader  which they bought  revamped and redirected  Huxley had already become part owner of the Natural History Review bolstered by the support of Lubbock  Rolleston  Busk and Carpenter  X clubbers and satellites   The journal was switched to pro Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861  After a stream of good articles the NHR failed after four years  but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution  The Reader also failed  despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science  The periodical market was quite crowded at the time  but most probably the critical factor was Huxley s time  he was simply over committed  and could not afford to hire full time editors  This occurred often in his life  Huxley took on too many ventures  and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him   However  the experience gained with the Reader was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of Nature in 1869  This time no mistakes were made  above all there was a permanent editor  though not full time   Norman Lockyer  who served until 1919  a year before his death  In 1925  to celebrate his centenary  Nature issued a supplement devoted to Huxley   The peak of the X Club s influence was from 1873–85 as Hooker  Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession  Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science  After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet  Hooker died in 1911  and Lubbock  now Lord Avebury  was the last surviving member   Huxley was also an active member of the Metaphysical Society  which ran from 1869–80  It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions  Tyndall and Huxley later joined The Club  founded by Dr  Johnson  when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up   4  Educational influence  When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses  Most biologists of his day were either self taught  or took medical degrees  When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities  and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed  Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation   4 1  School of Mines and Zoology  In the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington  ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London  The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching  an idea suggested by practice in German universities  In the main  the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types  and depended on the dissection of anatomy  supplemented by microscopy  museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster   The typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am  followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators  Huxley s demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life  spreading Huxley s ideas as well as their own  Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge  E  Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London  1875–91   Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford  1891–98  and Director of the Natural History Museum  1898–1907   S H  Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge  W T  Thiselton Dyer became Hooker s successor at Kew  he was already Hooker s son in law    T  Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College  Cardiff  and William Rutherford became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh  William Flower  Conservator to the Hunterian Museum  and THH s assistant in many dissections  became Sir William Flower  Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and  later  Director of the Natural History Museum  It s a remarkable list of disciples  especially when contrasted with Owen who  in a longer professional life than Huxley  left no disciples at all   No one fact tells so strongly against Owen    as that he has never reared one pupil or follower    Huxley s courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast   The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism   Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student  Sir Arthur Shipley said   Although  Darwin s later works all dealt with living organisms  yet our obsession was with the dead  with bodies preserved  and cut into the most refined slices   E W MacBride said  Huxley    would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living  active beings  in a word    he was a necrologist  To put it simply  Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes   This largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink  It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution  Darwin  Wallace  Fritz Müller  Henry Bates  were scarcely represented at all in Huxley s program  Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non existent  and theory  evolutionary or otherwise  was at a discount  Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley  and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes   Since Darwin  Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers  and Műller never returned from Brazil  the imbalance in Huxley s program went uncorrected  It is surely strange that Huxley s courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics  evidence which they had found so convincing  and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar  Desmond suggests that   biology  had to be simple  synthetic and assimilable  because  it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function   That must be part of the reason  indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology  But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man   Huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy  at which he was the greatest master of the day  He was not an all round naturalist like Darwin  who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life  Huxley chose  in his teaching  and to some extent in his research  to take a more straightforward course  concentrating on his personal strengths   4 2  Schools and the Bible  Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools  in November 1870 he was voted onto the London School Board  In primary schooling  he advocated a wide range of disciplines  similar to what is taught today  reading  writing  arithmetic  art  science  music  etc  In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper division work  focusing on a more specific area of study  A practical example is his famous essay On a piece of chalk first published in Macmillan s Magazine in London  1868  The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain  from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as  organized common sense    Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools  This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions  but he believed that the Bible s significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life   I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches   However  what Huxley proposed was to create an edited version of the Bible  shorn of  shortcomings and errors    statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur    These tender children  should  not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe   The Board voted against his idea  but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools  Vigorous debate took place on such points  and the debates were minuted in detail  Huxley said  I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools   The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible  but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught   It may be right to see Huxley s life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century  Ernst Mayr said  It can hardly be doubted that  biology  has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems   — and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain  Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism  though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic  not an atheist  He was  however  a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life  especially the  Roman Church    carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature  in the intellectual freedom  and in the political freedom of mankind   In the same line of thought  in an article in Popular Science  Huxtley used the expression  the so called Christianity of Catholicism   explaining   I say  so called  not by way of offense  but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implictly contained in any trust worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth    Vladimir Lenin remarked  in Materialism and empirio criticism   In Huxley s case    agnosticism serves as a fig leaf for materialism   see also the Debate with Wilberforce above    4 3  Adult education  Huxley s interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms  he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds  after all  he himself was largely self educated  There were his lecture courses for working men  many of which were published afterwards  and there was the use he made of journalism  partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public  For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the Westminster Review  the Saturday Review  the Reader  the Pall Mall Gazette  Macmillan s Magazine  the Contemporary Review  Germany was still ahead in formal science education  but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries   In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men s College in Blackfriars Road  The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker  Wm  Rossiter  who did most of the work  the funds were put up mainly by F D  Maurice s Christian Socialists  At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley  this was some bargain  and so was the free library organised by the college  an idea which was widely copied  Huxley thought  and said  that the men who attended were as good as any country squire   The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective  A good example was The physical basis of life  a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868  Its theme — that vital action is nothing more than  the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it  — shocked the audience  though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869  John Morley  the editor  said  No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation   The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word  Punch added  Professor Protoplasm  to his other soubriquets   The topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells  which is indeed a sensational sight  For these audiences Huxley s claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality  but by the working of its constituent chemicals  was surprising and shocking  Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do  but little of that was known in the nineteenth century   When the Archbishop of York thought this  new philosophy  was based on Auguste Comte s positivism  Huxley corrected him   Comte s philosophy  is just  Catholicism minus Christianity   Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays Methods & Results 156   A later version was   positivism is  sheer Popery with M  Comte in the chair of St Peter  and with the names of the saints changed    lecture on Huxley 1870 Lay Sermons  Addresses and Reviews p149   Huxley s dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte s ideas withered in Britain   5  Huxley and the humanities  During his life  and especially in the last ten years after retirement  Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities   Perhaps the best known of these topics is Evolution and Ethics  which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy  Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme  For a start  Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority  Next  he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects  Thus  our emotions  our intellect  our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution  and therefore inherited   Despite this  the details of our values and ethics are not inherited  they are partly determined by our culture  and partly chosen by ourselves  Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts  ethics cannot be derived from the struggle for existence  It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices  see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics   This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate  In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend Herbert Spencer   Huxley s dissection of Rousseau s views on man and society is another example of his later work  The essay undermines Rousseau s ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property  Characteristic is   Huxley s method of argumentation  his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print  is itself much studied  His career included controversial debates with scientists  clerics and politicians  persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies  lectures and articles for the general public  and a mass of detailed letter writing to friends and other correspondents  A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies   6  Royal and other commissions  Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions  titles somewhat shortened here   The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution  A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education  three involved medicine and three involved fisheries  Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues  All deal with possible changes to law and or administrative practice   6 1  Royal Commissions  1862 Trawling for herrings on the coast of Scotland   1863–65 Sea fisheries of the United Kingdom   1870–71 The Contagious Diseases Acts   1870–75 Scientific instruction and the advancement of science   1876 The practice of

evolutionary biologist and humanist   Aldous Huxley was a famous author  Brave New World 1932  Eyeless in Gaza 1936  The Doors of Perception 1954    Sir Andrew Huxley OM FRS won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963  He was the second Huxley to become President of the Royal Society  Other significant descendants of Huxley  such as Sir Crispin Tickell  are treated in the Huxley family   7 1  Mental problems in the family  Biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family  His father became  sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind   and later died in Barming Asylum  brother George suffered from  extreme mental anxiety  and died in 1863 leaving serious debts  Brother James  a well known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum  was at 55  as near mad as any sane man can be   and there is more  His favourite daughter  the artistically talented Mady  Marian   who became the first wife of artist John Collier  was troubled by mental illness for years  She died of pneumonia in her mid twenties   About Huxley himself we have a more complete record  As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner  aged thirteen or fourteen  Huxley was taken to watch a post mortem dissection  Afterwards he sank into a  deep lethargy  and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning  Bibby and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression  Huxley recuperated on a farm  looking thin and ill   The next episode we know of in Huxley s life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS Rattlesnake in 1848  Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871  and again in 1873  Finally  in 1884 he sank into another depression  and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885  at the age of only 60  This is enough to indicate the way depression  or perhaps a moderate bi polar disorder  interfered with his life  yet unlike some of the other family members  he was able to function extremely well at other times   The problems continued sporadically into the third generation  Two of Leonard s sons suffered serious depression  Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913  and five more later in life   8  Satires  Darwin s ideas and Huxley s controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires  It was the debate about man s place in nature that roused such widespread comment  cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count  Darwin s head on a monkey s body is one of the visual clichés of the age  The  Great Hippocampus Question  attracted particular attention   Monkeyana  Punch vol 40  18 May 1861   Signed  Gorilla   this turned out to be by Sir Philip Egerton MP  amateur naturalist  fossil fish collector and — Richard Owen s patron  Last two stanzas  Next HUXLEY replies That OWEN he lies And garbles his Latin quotation  That his facts are not new  His mistakes not a

Gorilla s Dilemma  Punch 1862  vol 43  p  164   First two lines  Say am I a man or a brother  Or only an anthropoid ape   Report of a sad case recently tried before the Lord Mayor  Owen versus Huxley  Lord Mayor asks whether either side is known to the police  Policeman X — Huxley  your Worship  I take to be a young hand  but very vicious  but Owen I have seen before  He got into trouble with an old bone man  called Mantell  who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones  People did say that the old man never got over it  and Owen worritted him to death  but I don t think it was so bad as that  Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury  I don t think it will be a harmonic meeting altogether  And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street   Tom Huxley s  low set  included Hooker  in the green and vegetable line  and  Charlie Darwin  the pigeon fancier   Owen s  crib in Bloomsbury  was the British Museum  of which Natural History was but one department    The Water Babies  a fairy tale for a land baby by Charles Kingsley  serialised in Macmillan s Magazine 1862–63  published in book form  with additions  in 1863   Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin s On the Origin of Species  having  long since    learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species   and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin s theory  with the main scientific participants appearing  including Richard Owen and Huxley  In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley s five year old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne  right  and wrote his grandfather a letter asking  Dear Grandpater – Have you seen a Waterbaby  Did you put it in a bottle  Did it wonder if it could get out  Could I see it some day  – Your loving Julian  Huxley wrote back  My dear Julian – I could never make sure about that Water Baby    My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever  Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did – There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things  When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great deal seers  and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing   9  Cultural references  Huxley appears alongside Charles Darwin and Samuel Wilberforce in the play Darwin
