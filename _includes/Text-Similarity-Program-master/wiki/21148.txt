The Netherlands      is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  It is a small  densely populated country  lying mainly in Western Europe  but also includes three islands in the Caribbean  The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east  Belgium to the south  and the North Sea to the northwest  sharing maritime borders with Belgium  the United Kingdom and Germany  The largest and most important cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam  The Hague and Rotterdam  Amsterdam is the country s capital  while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government  The port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe – as large as the next three largest combined   The Netherlands  name literally means  Low Country   inspired by its low and flat geography  with only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level  Most of the areas below sea level are man made  Since the late 16th century  large areas  polders  have been reclaimed from the sea and from lakes  amounting to nearly 17% of the country s current land mass   With a population density of 406 people per km² – 497 if water is excluded – the Netherlands is a very densely populated country for its size  Only Bangladesh  South Korea and Taiwan have both a larger population and a higher population density  Nevertheless  the Netherlands is the world s second largest exporter of food and agriculture products  after the United States   The Netherlands was one of the first countries in the world to have an elected parliament  and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy  organised as a unitary state  The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country  having legalised abortion  prostitution and euthanasia  while maintaining a progressive drugs policy  In 2001 it became the world s first country to legalize same sex marriage   The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU  Eurozone  G 10  NATO  OECD  WTO and a part of the trilateral Benelux economic union  The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts  the Permanent Court of Arbitration  the International Court of Justice  the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon  The first four are situated in The Hague  as is the EU s criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co operation agency Eurojust  This has led to the city being dubbed  the world s legal capital   The Netherlands is also a part of the Schengen Area   The Netherlands has a market based mixed economy  ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom  It had the thirteenth highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund  In 2013  the United Nations World Happiness Report ranked the Netherlands as the fourth happiest country in the world  reflecting its high quality of life   1  Etymology  The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to as the much older designation  Holland   though this strictly refers only to North and South Holland  two of the nation s twelve provinces  that were created out of the former County of Holland  That county was economically and politically the most important county in the region  Historically  Holland often served as a metonym for the entire country  Referring to the Netherlands as Holland is an example of pars pro toto and is considered either technically incorrect or informal  depending on the context  but is more acceptable when referring to the national football team   De Lage landen  The Low Countries  is a geographical designation of the general area of Belgium  the Netherlands  and Luxembourg  and is also known for the more geopolitical term Benelux  Depending on the context  the designation  Low Countries  sometimes extended with the former Burgundian and Habsburg possessions that are now part of northern France  French Flanders  French Hainaut  Artois  Picardy to the Somme  and the former Luxembourg region around Diedenhoven and Germany  east Frisia  Julich  Cleves  Bentheim  Lingen  the region around Geldern  around Bitburg  some municipalities east of the eastern provinces which were annexed by Prussia in 1815  etc    The Netherlands has about the same meaning as the Low Countries  but of a more historiographical nature   In the fifteenth century the name  the Netherlands    de Nederlanden   came into use  Unlike France and England it had no ethnic origin  but it was originally a geographical term which denoted only the difference with a higher ground  This was already in practice since Roman times  who made a distinction between the Roman provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior  referring to the downstream and upstream location of these two provinces  Place names with Neder and Nieder are still used in various places in respectively the Dutch and German language area  Also terms like lower Rhine and lower Meuse were commonly used  vs  middle Rhine or upper Rhine    Niderlant was in the late Middle Ages the region between the Meuse and the Rhine  the Lower Rhine Area now included  The area known as Oberland  High country  was considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne  By extension  the term could also be applied to the delta of the Schelde  Meuse and Rhine  and then would occur in the plural form  Due to the great importance of the Low Countries  the name was increasingly used specifically for this area  From about 1490  the Burgundian Habsburg provinces thus also were indicated  Besides Flanders   the Netherlands  was  from the mid sixteenth century on  probably the most commonly used name   2  History  2 1  Prehistory  before 500 BC   The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by its constantly shifting  low lying geography  The oldest human  Neanderthal  traces in the Netherlands where found in the Belvédère quarry near Maastricht  remains of a camp of hunter gatherers from 250 000 years ago  After the end of the ice age  various Paleolithic groups inhabited the area  and around 8000 BC Mesolithic tribes resided in Friesland and Drenthe  where the oldest canoe in the world is recovered  dating from the same period  Autochthonous hunter gatherers from the Swifterbant culture are attested from around 5600 BC onwards  They are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern Scandinavian Ertebølle culture  5300 BC–4000 BC   To the west  the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game  including seals  People made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between 4800 BC and 4500 BC  Agricultural transformation took place very gradually  between 4300 BC–4000 BC  The Funnelbeaker culture was a farming culture extending from Denmark through northern Germany into the northern Netherlands  In this period of Dutch prehistory the first notable remains were erected  the dolmens  large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe  and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC  To the southwest  the Vlaardingen culture  around 2600 BC   an apparently more primitive culture of hunter gatherers survived well into the Neolithic period  Around 2950 BC there was a quick and smooth transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the Corded Ware pastoralist culture  The Bell Beaker culture was also present in the Netherlands  that apparently arose out of the Corded Ware culture  The Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures were not indigenous to the Netherlands but were pan European in nature  extending across much of northern and central Europe   Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe  as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil  The Bronze age probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC  Typical bronze objects from this period included knives  swords  axes  fibulae and bracelets  Trading networks during this period extended a far distance  The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects  such as tin bead necklaces  suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age  The Bell Beaker cultures  2700–2100  locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed Wire Beaker culture  2100–1800   In the second millennium BC  the region was the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region  roughly divided by the course of the Rhine  In the north  the Elp culture  c  1800 to 800 BC  was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker  The initial phase was characterized by tumuli  1800–1200 BC  that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia  and were apparently related to the Tumulus culture  1600 BC – 1200 BC  in central Europe  This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring Urnfield  cremation  burial customs  1200–800 BC   The southern region became dominated by the Hilversum culture  1800–800   which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed Wire Beaker culture   The Iron Age brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present day Netherlands  Iron ore was available throughout the country  including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs  moeras ijzererts  in the north  the natural iron bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant  Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron  fabricating tools on demand  including axes  knives  pins  arrowheads and swords  Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel  The King s grave of Oss dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound  the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral   2 2  Germanic groups and Romans  500 BC – 410 AD   Deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC and later faster around 650 BC might have triggered migration of the Germanic tribes  By the time this migration was complete  around 250 BC  a few general cultural and linguistic groupings had emerged  The North Sea Germanic  or Ingvaeones  inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries  They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons  A second grouping  the Weser Rhine Germanic  or Istvaeones   extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers  This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks  Also the Celtic La Tène culture  c  450 BC up to the Roman conquest  had expanded over a wide range  including into the southern area of the Low Countries  Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language  neither Germanic nor Celtic  survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period  the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture  that eventually was being absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east   During the Gallic Wars  the area south of the Oude Rijn and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar from 57 BC to 53 BC  Caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands  the Menapii and the Eburones  The Rhine became fixed around 12 AD as Rome s northern frontier  Notable towns would arise along the Limes Germanicus  Nijmegen and Voorburg  At first part of Gallia Belgica  the area south of the Limes became part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior  The area to the north of the Rhine  inhabited by the Frisii  remained outside Roman rule  but not its presence and control   while the border tribes Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry  The Batavi rose against the Romans in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD  but were eventually defeated  The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks  which identity emerged at the first half of the 3rd century  Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies  The Salian Franks were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the 4th century  From their new base in west Flanders and southwest Netherlands  they were raiding the English Channel  Roman forces pacified the region  but did not expel the Franks  who continued to be feared at least until the time of Julian the Apostate  358   when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as foederati in Toxandria  After deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans withdrew  the Frisii disappeared from the northern Netherlands  probably forced to resettle within Roman territory as laeti in c  296  The coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries   2 3  Early Middle Ages  411–1000   After Roman government in the area collapsed  the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms  By the 490s  Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom  and from there continued his conquests into Gaul  During this expansion  Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population  A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north  i e  southern Netherlands and Flanders   who kept on speaking Old Frankish  which by the 9th century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch  A Dutch French language boundary came into existence  To the north of the Franks  climatic conditions at the coast improved  so the abandoned land of the ancient Frisii got resettled again  mostly by Saxons  but also by Angles and Jutes  Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo Saxons  but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians  named after the ancient inhabitants of the Frisii  Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast  and it is still the closest to English related living language after Scots  By the 7th century a Frisian Kingdom  650–734  under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Utrecht as its centre of power  while Dorestad was a Frisian flourishing trading place  Between 600 and around 719 the city was often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks  In 734  at the Battle of the Boarn  the Frisians in the Netherlands were after a series of wars defeated by the Franks  Anglo Saxon missionaries  particularly Willibrord  Wulfram and Boniface  played an important role in converting the Frisian peoples to Christianity  However  Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum  in 754   The Frankish Carolingian empire – that had the Roman Empire as its example – would eventually include much of Western Europe  but got divided into three parts in 843  Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of Middle Francia  Flanders became part of West Francia  Situated between – and wanted by – the realms of West and East Francia  Middle Francia was a weak kingdom that comprised territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south  Then  the middle kingdom was partitioned  the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and consecutively were named Lotharingia  After he died in 869  Lotharingia was partitioned  in Upper  and Lower Lotharingia  The latter part comprising the Low Countries  that technically became part of East Francia in 870  although it was effectively under control of Vikings  who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers  Around 850  Lothair I acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia  Around 879  another Viking terrorised the Frisian lands  He became known as Godfrid  Duke of Frisia  but he was assassinated in 885  after which Gerolf of Holland assumed lordship in Frisia and Viking rule came to an end  The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak  Resistance to the Vikings  if any  came from local nobles  who gained in stature as a result  and that lay the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into  semi  independent states   2 4  High Middle Ages  1000–1384   The Holy Roman Empire  the successor state of East Francia  ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century  but was not able to maintain political unity  Powerful local nobles turned their cities  counties and duchies into private kingdoms  that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor  Holland  Hainaut  Flanders  Gelre  Brabant  and the Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions  The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian  As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant  the area quickly became Old Low Franconian  or Old Dutch   The rest of Frisia in the north  now Friesland and Groningen  continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions  collectively called the  Frisian freedom   and resented the imposition of the feudal system   Around 1000 AD  due to several agricultural developments  the economy started to develop at a fast pace  and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen  Towns grew around monasteries and castles  and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas  especially in Flanders and later also Brabant  Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign  In practice  this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasi independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe   Around 1100 AD  farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands  and made the emergence of the County of Holland as center of power possible  The title of Count of Holland were fought over in the Hook and Cod Wars    between 1350 and 1490  The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities  while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen  These noblemen invited the Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy – who was also Count of Flanders – to conquer Holland   2 5  Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands  1384–1581   Most of the Imperial and French fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a personal union by Philip the Good  duke of Burgundy in 1433  The House of Valois Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581  Before the Burgundian union  the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county  The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began  The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests  that developed rapidly  The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times  Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region  Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium  Northern France and England  This trade was vital  because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself  Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained  Under Habsburg  Charles V  ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain  all fiefs in the current Netherlands region was united into the Seventeen Provinces  which also included most of present day Belgium  Luxembourg  and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany  In 1568  the Eighty Years  War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began  In 1579  the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army  The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands  In 1581  the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration  the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces   The protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish  and send an army of 7 600 soldiers to aid the Dutch in their war with the Catholic Spanish  The English army under command of Robert Dudley  1st Earl of Leicester was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion  Philip II  the son of Charles V  was not prepared to let them go easily  and war continued until 1648  when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised the independence of the seven north western provinces in the Peace of Münster  Parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican mercantile empire   2 6  Dutch Republic  1581–1795   After declaring their independence  the provinces of Holland  Zeeland  Groningen  Friesland  Utrecht  Overijssel  and Gelderland formed a confederation  All these duchies  lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government  the States Provincial  The States General  the confederal government  were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces  The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too  although it was not considered one of the provinces  Moreover  the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years  War a number of so called Generality Lands in Flanders  Brabant and Limburg  Their population was mainly Roman Catholic  and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own  and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish controlled Southern Netherlands   In the Dutch Golden Age  spanning much of the 17th century  the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers  Science  military  and art  especially painting  were among the most acclaimed in the world  By 1650  the Dutch owned 16 000 merchant ships  The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world  The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614  In South Africa  the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652  Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains  among them Colony of Surinam  now Suriname   In Asia  the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies  now Indonesia   and the only western trading post in Japan  Dejima   Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world  In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city  Amsterdam  and the first full time stock exchange  The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom bust cycle  the world s first asset inflation bubble  the tulip mania of 1636–1637  and the world s first bear raider  Isaac le Maire  who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount  The republic went into a state of general decline in the later 18th century  with economic competition from England and long standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society  the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden  as main factors   2 7  Batavian Republic and kingdom  1795–1890   With the armed support of revolutionary France  Dutch republicans proclaimed the Batavian Republic  modelled after the French Republic and rendering the Netherlands a unitary state in 19 January 1795  The stadtholder William V of Orange had fled to England  But from 1806 to 1810  Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte to control the Netherlands more effectively  However  King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother s  and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810  The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813  when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig William Frederick  son of the last stadtholder  returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands  Two years later  the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France  William Frederick raised this United Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself King William I  In addition  William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg in exchange for his German possessions  However  the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581  and rebelled  The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium  while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890  when William III died with no surviving male heirs  Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess   The Belgian Revolution at home and the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy  However  the Cultivation System was introduced in 1830  in the Dutch East Indies  20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export  The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self sufficient  On the other hand  the colonies in the West Indies  Dutch Guiana and Curaçao and Dependencies   relied heavily on African slaves in which the Dutch part is estimated at 5–7 percent  or more than half a million Africans  The Netherlands was one of the last countries to abolish slavery  in 1863  Furthermore  slaves in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873  since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10 year transition  The Dutch were also one of the last European countries to industrialise  in the second half of the 19th century   2 8  World Wars and beyond  1890–present   The Netherlands were able to remain neutral during World War I  In part  because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival  until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916  That changed in World War II  when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940  The Rotterdam Blitz forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender 4 days later  During the occupation  over 100 000 Dutch Jews were rounded up and transported to Nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived  Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany  civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers  and the countryside was plundered for food  Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans  local fascists joined the Waffen SS  fighting on the Eastern Front  Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB  the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands  On 8 December 1941  the Dutch government in exile in London declared war on Japan  but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies  Indonesia   In 1944–45  the First Canadian Army  which included Canadian  British and Polish troops  was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands  But soon after VE day  the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of Indonesia  In 1954  the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands reformed the political structure of the Netherlands  which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation  The Dutch colonies of Surinam and Curaçao and Dependencies and the European country became all constituent countries within the Kingdom  on a basis of equality  Before the reform was completed  Indonesia declared its independence in August 1945  recognised in 1949   and thus has never been part of the Kingdom  Suriname followed in 1975  After the war the Netherlands left behind also an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states  The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the Benelux  the NATO  and the European Coal and Steel Community  which would evolve into the EEC  Common Market  and later the European Union   Government encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500 000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war  The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change  such as rapid ontzuiling  literally  depillarisation   a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines  Youths  and students in particular  rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women s rights  sexuality  disarmament and environmental issues  On 10 October 2010  the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved  Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status  As a result the islands of Bonaire  Sint Eustatius and Saba  the BES islands  were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands  This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles  The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands   3  Geography of the Netherlands  3 1  The European Netherlands  The European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes 50° and 54° N  and longitudes 3° and 8° E   The Netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country  with about 26% of its area and 21% of its population located below sea level  and only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level  The country is for the most part flat  with the exception of foothills in the far southeast  up to a height of no more than 321 metres  and some low hill ranges in the central parts  Most of the areas below sea level are man made  caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation  Since the late 16th century  large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes  canals and pumping stations  Nearly 17% of the country s land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes   Much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large European rivers  the Rhine  Rijn   the Meuse  Maas  and the Scheldt  Schelde   as well as their distributaries  The south western part of the Netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers  the Rhine Meuse Scheldt delta   The Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine  the Waal  its main distributary branch  and the Meuse  In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide  as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their  Great Rivers   de Grote Rivieren   Another significant branch of the Rhine  the IJssel river  discharges into Lake IJssel  the former Zuiderzee   southern sea    Just like the previous  this river forms a linguistic divide  people to the northeast of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects  except for the province of Friesland  which has its own language    3 1 1  Floods  Over the centuries  the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention  Most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134  which created the archipelago of Zeeland in the south west   On 14 December 1287  St  Lucia s flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50 000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history  The St  Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder  replacing it with the Biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south centre  The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south west of the Netherlands  more than 1 800 people drowned in the flood  The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large scale programme  the  Delta Works   to protect the country against future flooding  which was completed over a period of more than thirty years   The impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity  Relatively high lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland  The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop  upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level  causing the underlying peat to contract further  Additionally  until the 19th century peat was mined  dried  and used for fuel  further exacerbating the problem  Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres  Even in flooded areas  peat extraction continued through turf dredging   Because of the flooding  farming was difficult  which encouraged foreign trade  the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th 15th century   To guard against floods  a series of defences against the water were contrived  In the first millennium AD  villages and farmhouses were built on man made hills called terps  Later  these terps were connected by dikes  In the 12th century  local government agencies called  waterschappen    water boards   or  hoogheemraadschappen    high home councils   started to appear  whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods  these agencies continue to exist  As the ground level dropped  the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system  By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level  The windmills were later used to drain lakes  creating the famous polders   In 1932 the Afsluitdijk   Closure Dike   was completed  blocking the former Zuiderzee  Southern Sea  from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer  IJssel Lake   It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling were reclaimed from the sea   The Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change  Not only is the rising sea a problem  but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow   3 1 1 1  Delta works  After the 1953 disaster  the Delta Works were constructed  a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast  The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering  New projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the Delta Works  A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10 000 years  compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country   This was achieved by raising of outer sea dykes and of inner  canal  and river dikes  and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province  New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements  The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world   It is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level which  despite popular belief  will possibly not overwhelm the measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods  Even more specifically  the Netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise  A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of and a simultaneous land height decline of   The plan foresees in the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with of additional flood protection  Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side  but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run off  To protect the country from river flooding  another program is already being executed  The Room for the River plan grants more flow space to rivers  protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands  The few residents that lived in these so called  overflow areas  have been moved to higher ground  with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels   Protecting the country against floods is one element of climate change  The other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increase  As a result  the fresh water table will be pushed more inland  resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces  Due to this change  some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water  It will also affect agriculture  The greenhouses can continue their production by becoming more water efficient  they are already disconnected from the groundwater  thereby not becoming more saline   though they will need to become more energy and water efficient  The push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and fauna   3 1 2  Climate  The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is south west  which causes a moderate maritime climate  with cool summers and mild winters  and typically high humidity  This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline  where temperatures can be more than higher  in winter  or lower  in summer  than in the  south  east of the country   The following tables are based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1981 and 2010   Ice days  maximum temperature below   usually occur from December until February  with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period  Freezing days  minimum temperature below   occur much more often  usually ranging from mid November to late March  but not rarely measured as early as mid October and as late as mid May  If one chooses the height of measurement to be above ground instead of   one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer  On average  snow can occur from November to April  but sometimes occurs in May or October too   Warm days  maximum temperature above   in De Bilt are usually found in April to October  but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March  or even sometimes in November or February  usually not in De Bilt  however   Summer days  maximum temperature above   are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September  tropical days  maximum temperature above   are rare and usually occur only in June to August   Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month  Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months  mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days  this is especially the case in summer  when lightning is also much more frequent   The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude  the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June   3 1 3  Nature  The Netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves  that include lakes  heathland  woods  dunes and other habitats  Most of these are owned by Staatsbosbeheer  the national department for forestry and nature conservation and Natuurmonumenten  literally  Natures monuments    a private organisation that buys  protects and manages nature reserves  The Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in the north  with its tidal flats and wetlands  is rich in biological diversity  and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Nature Site in 2009   The Oosterschelde  formerly the northeast estuary of the river Scheldt was designated a national park in 2002  thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of   It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde  but also includes mud flats  meadows  and shoals  Because of the large variety of sea life  including unique regional species  the park is popular with Scuba divers  Other activities include sailing  fishing  cycling  and bird watching   Phytogeographically  the Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature  the territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests  In 1871  the last old original natural woods were cut down  and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like Scots Pine and trees that are not native to the Netherlands  These woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand drifts  overgrazed heaths   Veluwe    3 2  Caribbean islands  The Caribbean Netherlands form a part of the Lesser Antilles  Within this island group   Bonaire is part of the ABC islands within the Leeward Antilles island chain off the Venezuelan coast  The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin   Saba and Sint Eustatius are part of the SSS islands  They are located east of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands  Although in the English language they are considered part of the Leeward Islands  French  Spanish  Dutch and the English spoken locally consider them part of the Windward Islands  The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly  leaving little ground suitable for agriculture  The highest point is Mount Scenery    on Saba  also the highest point in all the Kingdom of the Netherlands   The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round  The Leeward Islands are warmer and drier than the Windward islands  In summer  the Windward Islands can be subject to hurricanes   4  Government  The Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848  The Netherlands is described as a consociational state  Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues  within both the political community and society as a whole  In 2010  The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 10th most democratic country in the world  The monarch is the head of state  at present King Willem Alexander  Constitutionally  the position is equipped with limited powers  By law  the king  the title queen has no constitutional significance  has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs  Depending on the personalities and relationships of the king and the ministers  the king might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution   The executive power is formed by the council of Ministers  the deliberative council of the Dutch cabinet  The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries  One to three ministers are ministers without portfolio  The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands  who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition  The Prime Minister is a primus inter pares  with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers  Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister since October 2010  the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973   The cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament  the States General  which also has legislative powers  The 150 members of the House of Representatives  the Lower House  are elected in direct elections on the basis of party list proportional representation  These are held every four years  or sooner in case the cabinet falls  for example  when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence  the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch   The States Provincial are directly elected every four years as well  The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the Senate  the upper house  which has the power to reject laws  but not propose or amend them   4 1  Political culture  Both trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial  economic and social areas  They meet regularly with government in the Social Economic Council  This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily   The Netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance  In the 18th century  while the Dutch Reformed Church was the state religion  Catholicism  other forms of Protestantism  such as Baptists and Lutherans  and Judaism were tolerated   In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation  in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government  This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs  prostitution  LGBT rights  euthanasia  and abortion  which are among the most liberal in the world   4 2  Political parties  Because of the multi party system  no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century  and coalition cabinets had to be formed  Since suffrage became universal in 1919  the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties  the strongest of which were the Christian democrats  currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal  CDA   second were the social democrats  represented by the Labour Party  PvdA   and third were the liberals  of which the right wing People s Party for Freedom and Democracy  VVD  is the main representative   These parties co operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner  so either a centre left coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals  In the 1970s  the party system became more volatile  the Christian democratic parties lost seats  while new parties became successful  such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66   In the 1994 election  the CDA lost its dominant position  A  purple  cabinet was formed by VVD  D66  and PvdA  In the 2002 elections  this cabinet lost its majority  because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right LPF  a new political party  around Pim Fortuyn  who was assassinated a week before the elections  A short lived cabinet was formed by CDA  VVD  and LPF  which was led by the CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende  After the 2003 elections  in which the LPF lost most of its seats  a cabinet was formed by CDA  VVD  and D66  The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state  the healthcare system  and immigration policy   In June 2006  the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the Minister of Immigration and Integration  Rita Verdonk  who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali  a VVD MP  A caretaker cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD  and general elections were held on 22 November 2006  In these elections  the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains  The formation of a new cabinet took three months  resulting in a coalition of CDA  PvdA  and ChristianUnion   On 20 February 2010  the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan  Afghanistan  Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010  with devastating results for the previously largest party  the CDA  which lost about half of its seats  resulting in 21 seats  The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats  closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats  The big winner of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders  whose extreme right wing PVV  the ideological successor to the LPF  more than doubled its number of seats  Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government  led by VVD  a first  in coalition with CDA  which was sworn in on 14 October 2010  This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV  but proved ultimately to be unstable  when on 21 April 2012  Wilders  leader of PVV  unexpectedly  torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks  on new austerity measures  paving the way for early elections   VVD and PvdA were the big winners of the elections  Since 5 November 2012 they have formed the second Rutte cabinet   4 3  Administrative divisions  The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces  each under a Commissioner of the King  Commissaris van de Koning   except for Limburg province where the position is named Governor  Gouverneur   All provinces are divided into municipalities  gemeenten   of which there are 403   The country is also subdivided into 24 water districts  governed by a water board  waterschap or hoogheemraadschap   each having authority in matters concerning water management  The creation of water boards actually pre dates that of the nation itself  the first appearing in 1196  The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence   The administrative structure on the 3 BES islands  also known as the Caribbean Netherlands  is different  These islands have the status of openbare lichamen  public bodies  and are generally referred to as special municipalities  They are not part of a province   4 3 1  Provinces  4 3 2  Special municipalities  4 4  Foreign relations  The history of Dutch foreign policy has been characterised by its neutrality  Since the Second World War the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations  most prominently the UN  NATO and the EU  The Dutch economy is very open and relies on international trade   The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments  to Atlantic co operation  to European integration  to international development and to international law  One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs   During and after the Dutch Golden Age  the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire  which fell apart quickly after the Second World War  The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands   4 5  Military  The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe  it was first established as such by Maurice of Nassau  The Dutch army was used throughout the Dutch Empire  After the defeat of Napoleon  the Dutch army was transformed into a conscription army  The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the Belgian revolution in 1830  After 1830  it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies  as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars  including the First World War   until the Netherlands was invaded in the Second World War and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940   The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the Treaty of Brussels  and later became a founding member of NATO in 1949  The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe  deploying its army to several bases in Germany  More than 3 000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War  In 1996 conscription was suspended  and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army  Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War  it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein  and it was engaged in Afghanistan   The military is composed of four branches  all of which carry the prefix Koninklijke  Royal    Koninklijke Landmacht  KL   the Royal Netherlands Army  Koninklijke Marine  KM   the Royal Netherlands Navy  including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps  Koninklijke Luchtmacht  KLu   the Royal Netherlands Air Force  Koninklijke Marechaussee  KMar   the Royal Marechaussee  Military Police   tasks include military police and border control General Tom Middendorp is the current Commander of the Netherlands armed forces  All military specialities except the submarine service and the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps  Korps Mariniers  are open to women  The Korps Commandotroepen  the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army  is open to women  but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training  it is almost impossible for women to become a commando  The Dutch Ministry of Defence employs more than 70 000 personnel  including over 20 000 civilians and over 50 000 military personnel  In April 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure  including a decrease in the number of tanks  fighter aircraft  naval ships and senior officials   5  Economy  The Netherlands has a developed economy and has been playing a special role in the European economy for many centuries  Since the 16th century  shipping  fishing  trade  and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy  The Netherlands is one of the world s 10 leading exporting countries  Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector  Other major industries include chemicals  metallurgy  machinery  electrical goods  and tourism  in 2012 the Netherlands welcomed 11 7 million international tourists   Examples include Unilever  Heineken  financial services  ING   chemicals  DSM  AKZO   petroleum refining  Shell   electronical machinery  Philips  ASML   and car navigation  TomTom    The Netherlands has the 17th largest economy in the world  and ranks 10th in GDP  nominal  per capita  Between 1997 and 2000 annual economic growth  GDP  averaged nearly 4%  well above the European average  Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown  but accelerated to 4 1% in the third quarter of 2007  In May 2013  inflation was at 2 8% per year  In April 2013  unemployment was at 8 2%  or 6 7% following the ILO definition  of the labour force   In Q3 and Q4 2011  the Dutch economy contracted by 0 4% and 0 7%  respectively  because of European Debt Crisis  while in Q4 the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0 3%  The Netherlands also has a relatively low GINI coefficient of 0 326  Despite ranking 7th in GDP per capita  UNICEF ranked the Netherlands 1st in child well being  On the Index of Economic Freedom Netherlands is the 13th most free market capitalist economy out of 157 surveyed countries   Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands  The Amsterdam Stock Exchange  AEX   part of Euronext  is the world s oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe s largest bourses  It is situated near Dam Square in the city s centre  As a founding member of the euro  the Netherlands replaced  for accounting purposes  its former currency  the  gulden   guilder   on 1 January 1999  along with 15 other adopters of the euro  Actual euro coins and banknotes followed on 1 January 2002  One euro was equivalent to 2 20371 Dutch guilders  In the Caribbean Netherlands  the United States dollar is used instead of the euro   The Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the UK and Germany  with the port of Rotterdam being the largest port in Europe  Other important parts of the economy are international trade  Dutch colonialism started with co operative private enterprises such as the VOC   banking and transport  The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners  Amsterdam is the 5th busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4 2 million international visitors  Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from central and eastern Europe   Of economic importance is BrabantStad  a partnership between the municipalities of Breda  Eindhoven  Helmond   s Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and the province of North Brabant  BrabantStad is the fastest growing economic region in the Netherlands  with Brainport as one of the three national top regions and as a top region in the world  The region lies within the Eindhoven Leuven Aachen Triangle  ELAT   The partnership aims to form an urban network and to make North Brabant explicitly known as a leading knowledge region within Europe  With a total of 1 5 million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands is BrabantStad one of the major economical important  metropolitan regions of the Netherlands  Of all the money that goes to research and development in the Netherlands  one third is spent in Eindhoven  A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT   Of all European patent applications in the field of physics and electronics about eight per cent is from North Brabant  In the extended region  BrabantStad is part of the Eindhoven Leuven Aachen Triangle  ELAT   This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the European Union  measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy   The economic success of this region is important for the international competitiveness of the Netherlands  Together Amsterdam  airport   Rotterdam  seaport   and Eindhoven  Brainport  form the foundation of the Dutch economy   The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States  The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005  but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment  The pace of job growth reached 10 year highs in 2007  The Netherlands is the fifth most competitive economy in the world  according to the World Economic Forum s Global Competitiveness Report   The Groningen gas field  one of the largest natural gas fields in the world  is situated near Slochteren  Exploitation of this field has resulted in €159 billion in revenue since the mid 1970s   5 1  Agriculture  The Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised  and has a strong focus on international exports  It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses for the food processing industry and accounts for 21 percent of the Netherlands  total export value  The Dutch rank second worldwide in value of agricultural exports  behind only the United States  with exports earning €79 billion in 2013  up from €75 4 billion in 2012  The Netherlands exports a quarter of all the world s tomatoes  and trade of one third of the world s exports of chilis  tomatoes and cucumbers goes through the country  The Netherlands also exports one fifteenth of the world s apples   Aside from that  a significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh cut plants  flowers  and flower bulbs  with the Netherlands exporting two thirds of the world s total   5 2  Transport  Mobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year  three quarters of which are done by car  Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car  25% by bicycle  20% walking  and 5% by public transport  With a total road network of 139 295 km  which includes 2 758 km of expressways  the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world — much denser than Germany and France  but still not as dense as Belgium   About 13% of all distance is travelled by public transport  the majority of which by train  Like in many other European countries  the Dutch rail network of 3 013 route km is also rather dense  The network is mostly focused on passenger rail services and connects virtually all major towns and cities  Trains are frequent  with one or two trains per hour on lesser lines  two to four trains per hour on average  and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines  Cycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the Netherlands  Almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train  The Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles  which makes more than one per capita  and twice as many as the ca  9 million motor vehicles on the road  In 2013  the European Cyclists  Federation ranked both the Netherlands and Denmark as the most bike friendly countries in Europe  but more of the Dutch  31%  than of the Danes  19%  list the bike as their main mode of transport for daily activities  Cycling infrastructure is comprehensive  Busy roads have received some 35 000 km of dedicated cycle tracks  physically segregated from motorised traffic  Busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle specific traffic lights  There are large bicycle parking facilities  particularly in city centres and at train stations   Rotterdam has the largest port in Europe  with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel  Switzerland  and into France  As of 2013  Rotterdam was the world s eighth largest container port handling 440 5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually  The port s main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment  The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas  From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship  river barge  train or road  In 2007  the Betuweroute  a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany  was completed   As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability  the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 recharging stations for electric vehicles across the country by 2015  The rollout will be undertaken by Switzerland based power and automation company ABB and Dutch startup Fastned  and will aim to provide at least one station within a 50 kilometre radius  30 miles  from every home in the Netherlands   6  Demographics  The Netherlands had an estimated population of 16 785 403 on 30 April 2013  It is the 10th most populous country in Europe and the 63rd most populous country in the world  Between 1900 and 1950  the country s population almost doubled from 5 1 to 10 0 million people  From 1950 to 2000  the population further increased from 10 0 to 15 9 million people  but the rate of population growth was less than that of the previous fifty years  The estimated growth rate is 0 44%   The fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1 78 children per woman  2013 est   which is high compared with many other European countries  but below the rate of 2 1 children per woman required for natural population replacement  Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands  83 21 years for newborn girls and 78 93 for boys  2013 est   The country has a migration rate of 1 99 migrants per 1 000 inhabitants per year   The majority of the population of the Netherlands is ethnically Dutch  A 2005 estimate counted  80 9% Dutch  2 4% Indonesian  2 4% German  2 2% Turkish  2 0% Surinamese  1 9% Moroccan  0 8% Antillean and Aruban  and 7 4% others  Some 150 000 to 200 000 people living in the Netherlands are Expatriates  mostly concentrated in and around Amsterdam and The Hague  now constituting almost 10% of the population of these cities  The Dutch are the tallest people in the world  with an average height of for adult males and for adult females in 2009  People in the south are on average about shorter than those in the north   Dutch people  or descendants of Dutch people  are also found in migrant communities worldwide  notably in Canada  Australia  Brazil  South Africa and the United States  According to the 2006 US Census  more than 5 million Americans claim total or partial Dutch ancestry  There are close to 3 million Dutch descended Afrikaners living in South Africa  In 1940  there were 290 000 Europeans and Eurasians in Indonesia  but most have since left the country  According to Eurostat  in 2010 there were 1 8 million foreign born residents in the Netherlands  corresponding to 11 1% of the total population  Of these  1 4 million  8 5%  were born outside the EU and 0 428 million  2 6%  were born in another EU Member State   The Netherlands is the 24th most densely populated country in the world  with —or if only the land area is counted  The Randstad is the country s largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities  Amsterdam in the province North Holland  Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland  and Utrecht in the province Utrecht  The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe   6 1  Language  The official language is Dutch  which is spoken by the vast majority of the inhabitants  Besides Dutch  West Frisian is recognized as a second official language in the northern province of Friesland  Fryslân in West Frisian   West Frisian has a formal status for government correspondence in that province  In the European part of the Netherlands two other regional languages are recognized under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages   The first of these regional languages is Low Saxon  Nedersaksisch in Dutch  is recognised  Low Saxon consists of several dialects spoken in the north and east  like Twents in the region of Twente  and Drents in the province of Drenthe  Secondly  Limburgish is also recognised as regional language  It consists of Dutch varieties of Meuse Rhenish Franconian languages and is spoken in the south eastern province of Limburg  The dialects most spoken in the Netherlands are the Brabantian Hollandic dialects   English has a formal status in the special municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius  It is widely spoken on these islands  Papiamento has a formal status in the special municipality of Bonaire  Yiddish and the Romani language were recognised in 1996 as non territorial languages   The Netherlands has a tradition of learning foreign languages  formalized in Dutch education laws  Some 87% of the total population indicate they are able to converse in English  70% in German  and 29% in French  English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools  In most lower level secondary school educations  vmbo   one additional modern foreign language is mandatory during the first two years   In higher level secondary schools  havo and vwo   two additional modern foreign languages are mandatory during the first three years  Only during the last three years in vwo one foreign language is mandatory  Besides English  the standard modern languages are French and German  although schools can replace one of these modern languages with Spanish  Turkish  Arabic  or Russian  Additionally  schools in the Frisia region teach and have exams in Frisian  and schools across the country teach and have exams in classical Greek and Latin for secondary school  called gymnasium or vwo+    6 2  Religion  The Netherlands was a predominantly Christian society until late into the 20th century  with a strong demarcation  pillarisation  between roughly the Catholic south on one side and the Calvinist north on the other side  In the 1960s  this started to diminish  Although religious diversity remains  there has been a decline of religious adherence  The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries in Western Europe  with only 39% being religiously affiliated  31% for those aged under 35   and fewer than 5 6% visiting church regularly  meaning once or more per month  in 2010  Religion is in the Netherlands generally considered a personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public   According to a Eurobarometer poll in 2010  28% of the Dutch citizens responded that  they believe there is a God   whereas 39% answered that  they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force   and 30% that  they do not believe there is any sort of spirit  god  or life force   Since 1989  the unaffiliated have become mainstream  the number of adults without a religion in 2005 being at 51 3% and steadily growing  Almost all Christian groups show a decrease in the number of members or less stable membership  However  in particular the loss of members of the two major churches  which are the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands  with a membership loss of more than 300 000 members between late 2005 and late 2010  and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands  with a membership loss of more than 150 000 members  cause the number of Christians in the Netherlands to have decreased from approximately 7 132 million  44%  by the end of 2005 to 6 861 million  39%  by the end of 2010  Also Ietsism  Agnosticism and Christian atheism are on the rise  the first two being general accepted and the last being more or less considered to be non controversial  A countervailing trend is produced by a religious revival in the Protestant Bible Belt  and the growth of Muslim and Hindu communities resulting from immigration and high birth rates  The SCP  Sociaal Cultureel Planbureau  expects the number of non affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020   Different sources give very different percentages  A 2007 research God in Nederland  based on in depth interviews of 1132 people concluded that 61% of the Dutch are non affiliated  Fewer than 7% attend church regularly  at least once a month   Similar studies were done in 1966  1979 and 1996  showing a steady decline of religious affiliation  That this trend is likely to continue is illustrated by the fact that in the age group under 35  69% are non affiliated  However  those who do identify with a religious denomination tend to be more profoundly religious than in the past  Religious belief is also regarded as a very personal affair  as is illustrated by the fact that 60% of self described believers are not affiliated with any organised religion  There is a stronger stress on positive sides of belief  with Hell and the concept of damnation being pushed into the background  One quarter of non believers sometimes pray  but more in a sense of meditative self reflection   Freedom of education has been guaranteed by the Dutch constitution since 1917  and schools run by religious groups  especially Catholic and Protestant  are funded by the government  All schools must meet strict quality criteria   Three political parties in the Dutch parliament  CDA  ChristianUnion  and SGP  base their policy on Christian belief in varying degrees  Although the Netherlands is a secular state  in some municipalities where the Christian parties have the majority  the council meetings are opened by prayer   Municipalities in general also give civil servants a day off on Christian religious holidays  such as Easter and the Ascension of Jesus   6 2 1  Roman Catholicism  Currently  Roman Catholicism is the single largest religion of the Netherlands with around four million registered adherents which is 24% of the Dutch population in 2011  In the second half of the twentieth century a rapid secularization took place in the Catholic parts of the Netherlands  In 2006 slightly more than half of the Brabantian people identified with Catholicism  but only 1–2% of the total population of that area attend mass  and these churchgoers consist mostly of people over 65 years old   Since the provinces of North Brabant and Limburg are in the Netherlands historically most Roman Catholic  their people still use the term and some traditions as a base for their cultural identity rather than as a religious identity  The vast majority of the Catholic population in the Netherlands is now largely irreligious in practice  Research among Catholics in the Netherlands in 2007 shows that only 27% of the Dutch Catholics can be regarded as a theist  55% as an ietsist   agnostic theist and 17% as agnostic   6 2 2  Protestantism  The Protestant Church in the Netherlands  PKN  follows with 10 8% of the population  It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the two major strands of Calvinism  the Dutch Reformed Church  the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church  Other Protestant churches  both orthodox Calvinist and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN  The number of members falls on average by about 2 5% per year  This is caused primarily by the death of older members and little growth among the younger population  Research in 2007 concludes that 42% of the members of the PKN is a non theist  Furthermore  in the Protestant Church in the Netherlands  PKN  and several other smaller denominations of the Netherlands  1 in 6 clergy are either agnostic or atheist   6 2 3  Humanism  A research in 2003 shows that about 1 27 million people in the Netherlands express explicitly an affinity with secular humanism  which is about 9 4% of the total population  Erasmus and Dirck Coornhert are important early representatives of humanism in the Netherlands in the 16th century  In the 17th century  especially Spinoza and Hugo Grotius were important  During the Age of Enlightenment  18th century   the importance of science and research increased sharply  Confidence in human understanding and logical reasoning was given shape in liberalism   The German philosophers Ludwig Feuerbach and Kant and the evolution theory of Darwin  among other scientific theories in the 19th century  had an exceptionally strong influence and were a major step in the development of humanism in the Netherlands  The modern organized humanist movement began in the Netherlands in the mid nineteenth century with the establishment of freethinkers association De Dageraad  Dawn   The members  including writer Multatuli and later Anton Constandse  Marx  socialism had a significant influence on the Dutch humanism of the 20th century   With the establishment of the humanistic associations Humanitas in 1945 and the Humanistisch Verbond in 1946  Dutch humanists organized themselves after the Second World War  When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations in 1948  the Dutch Humanist movements became involved with the establishment of the International Humanist and Ethical Union in 1952  and since 1990 also the European Humanist Federation    6 2 4  Pluralism  Slightly more than half  52 8%  of the respondents to a research about humanism in 2003 affiliated with no religious or philosophical movement at all  In contrast 8% said to follow more than 1 movement  This form of pluralism occurs in all religious and philosophical Dutch movements  but is strongest among supporters of non Western religions  75% of Dutch Buddhists also affiliate with other religious or philosophical movements  Among followers of Hinduism in the Netherlands  this ratio is even higher  at 91%   On the other hand  followers of Western religions and humanism  as well as movements in the  other  category were least likely to affiliate with more than one religious or philosophical movement  Within Western movements the people affiliating with humanism were most likely to also adhere to one or more other movements  47%   Most of these humanists adhere to Catholicism  27%   Protestantism  14%  or Buddhism  12%   Also 9% of Catholics  6% of Protestants and 50% of the Buddhists counting themselves as humanists  as well as 25% of the Muslims  55% of the Hindu  19% of the Jews and 15% of the supporters of a movement other than these listed   6 2 5  Minority religions  In 2006  there were 850 000 Muslims  As a result of different determination methods in 2012 this number had dropped to 825 000  4% of the total Dutch population   Muslim numbers began to rise after the 1970s as the result of immigration  Some migrants from former Dutch colonies  such as Surinam and Indonesia  were sometimes Muslim  but migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco are the biggest part  as well as their children  During the 1990s  the Netherlands opened its borders for Muslim refugees from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina  Iran  Iraq  Somalia  and Afghanistan  Muslims form a diverse group  Social tensions between native Dutch and migrant Muslims began to rise in the early 21st century  with the rise and murder of populist politician Pim Fortuyn by militant animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf and the murder of Theo van Gogh by an extremist Muslim  Mohammed Bouyeri  There are about 1 500 Ahmadi Muslims in the Netherlands   The Netherlands has an estimated 250 000 Buddhists or people who feel strongly attracted by this religion  mainly ethnic Dutch people  There are approximately 200 000 Hindus  most of them of Surinamese origin  Sikhs are another religious minority in the Netherlands  numbering around 12 000  mainly located in or around Amsterdam  There are five gurudwaras in the Netherlands  The Association of Religion Data Archives  relying on World Christian Encyclopedia  estimated some 6 400 Bahá ís in 2005   Although the Holocaust deeply affected the Jewish community  killing about 75% of its 140 000 members at the time   it has managed to rebuild a vibrant and lively Jewish life for its approximately 45 000 current members  Around 10% of the population of Amsterdam was Jewish at the start of World War II   6 3  Education  Education in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 4 and 16  and partially compulsory between the ages of 16 and 18   All children in the Netherlands usually attend elementary school from  on average  ages 4 to 12  It comprises eight grades  the first of which is facultative  Based on an aptitude test  the 8th grade teacher s recommendation and the opinion of the pupil s parents or caretakers  a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education  after completing a particular stream  a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream    The vmbo has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels  Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low level vocational degree that grants access to the mbo   MBO   middle level applied education    This form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade  or a vocational degree  With the mbo certification  a student can apply for the hbo   The havo has 5 grades and allows for admission to the hbo   HBO   higher professional education    are universities of professional education  or applied sciences  that award professional bachelor degrees  similar to polytechnic degrees  A HBO degrees gives access to the university system   The vwo  including atheneum and gymnasium  has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a  research  university   Universities offer of a three year bachelor s degree  followed by a one   or two year master s degree  which in turn can be followed by a four year doctoral degree program  Doctoral candidates in the Netherlands are temporary employees of a university   7  Culture  7 1  Art  philosophy and literature  The Netherlands has had many well known painters  The 17th century  in which the Dutch Republic was prosperous  was the age of the  Dutch Masters   such as Rembrandt van Rijn  Johannes Vermeer  Jan Steen  Jacob van Ruysdael and many others  Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were Vincent van Gogh and Piet Mondriaan  M  C  Escher is a well known graphics artist  Willem de Kooning was born and trained in Rotterdam  although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist   The Netherlands is the country of philosophers Erasmus of Rotterdam and Spinoza  All of Descartes  major work was done in the Netherlands  The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens  1629–1695  discovered Saturn s moon Titan  argued that light travelled as waves  invented the pendulum clock and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae  Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms with a microscope  In the Dutch Golden Age  literature flourished as well  with Joost van den Vondel and P  C  Hooft as the two most famous writers  In the 19th century  Multatuli wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in Dutch colonies  Important 20th century authors include Harry Mulisch  Jan Wolkers  Simon Vestdijk  Hella S  Haasse  Cees Nooteboom  Gerard  van het  Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans  Anne Frank s Diary of a Young Girl was published after she died in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages   Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in Huis Ten Bosch  Nagasaki  Japan  A similar Holland Village is being built in Shenyang  China  Windmills  tulips  wooden shoes  cheese  Delftware pottery  and cannabis are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists   The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country  considering its drug policy and its legalisation of euthanasia  On 1 April 2001  the Netherlands became the first nation to legalise same sex marriage   7 2  Dutch value system and etiquette  The Dutch have a code of etiquette which governs social behaviour and is considered important  Because of the international position of the Netherlands  many books have been written on the subject  Some customs may not be true in all regions and they are never absolute  In addition to those specific to the Dutch  many general points of European etiquette apply to the Dutch as well   Dutch society is egalitarian  individualistic and modern  The people tend to view themselves as modest  independent and self reliant  They value ability over dependency  The Dutch have an aversion to the non essential   Ostentatious behaviour is to be avoided  Accumulating money is fine  but public spending of large amounts of money is considered something of a vice and associated with being a show off  A high lifestyle is considered wasteful and suspect with most people  The Dutch are proud of their cultural heritage  rich history in art and involvement in international affairs   Dutch manners are blunt with a no nonsense attitude  informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour  This might be perceived as impersonal and patronising by other cultures  but is the norm in Dutch culture  According to a humorous source on Dutch culture  The UnDutchables  Their directness gives many the impression that they are rude and crude—attributes they prefer to call ‘openness’   A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is  Dealing with the Dutch  from Jacob Vossestein  Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal  especially from a moral point of view  and accordingly  causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status  As always  manners differ between groups  Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite  What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather   7 3  Music  The Netherlands has multiple music traditions  Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as  Levenslied   meaning Song of life  to an extent comparable to a French Chanson or a German Schlager  These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm  and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains  Themes can be light  but are often sentimental and include love  death and loneliness  Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music  though in recent years many artists also use synthesizers and guitars  Artists in this genre include Jan Smit  Frans Bauer and the late André Hazes   Contemporary Dutch rock and pop music  Nederpop  originated in the 1960s  heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain  In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English  and some tracks were instrumental  Bands such as Shocking Blue   the  Golden Earring and Focus enjoyed international success  As of the 1980s  more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language  partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar  Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages  with some artists recording in either  Current symphonic metal bands Epica and Within Temptation as well as jazz   pop singer Caro Emerald are having some international success  Contemporary local heroes include rock singer Anouk  country pop singer Ilse DeLange  rock band Kane and Dutch language duo Nick & Simon   Early 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited  Selling 18 million records  the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day  Tracks like  Get Ready for This  are still popular themes of U S  sports events  like the NHL  In the mid 1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop  Nederhop  also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium  Artists with North African  Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre   Since the 1990s Dutch electronic dance music  EDM  conquered the world in many forms  from trance  techno and gabber to hardstyle  Some of the world s best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands  including Armin van Buuren  Tiësto  Hardwell  Martin Garrix  Sander van Doorn and Afrojack  the first three of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs  The Amsterdam dance event  ADE  is the world s leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic sub genres on the planet  These artists also contribute significantly to the mainstream pop music played over the airwaves all around the world  as they frequently collaborate and produce for many notable artists   In classical music  Jan Sweelinck ranks as the Netherlands  most famous composer  with Louis Andriessen amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers  Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and André Rieu  The latter  together with his Johann Strauss Orchestra  has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours  the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world s biggest rock and pop music acts  Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album with works from Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp  with approval of Glass himself  The Concertgebouw  completed in 1888  in Amsterdam is home to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra  considered one of the world s finest orchestras   Aruba and the five main islands of the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Lesser Antilles island chain  Their music is a mixture of native  African and Dutch elements  and is closely connected with trends from neighboring islands like Barbados  Martinique  Trinidad and Tobago and Guadeloupe  as well as the mainland former Dutch possession of Suriname  which has exported kaseko music to great success on the islands  Curaçao and Bonaire likely have the most active and well known music scenes  Curaçao is known for a kind of music called tumba  which is named after the conga drums that accompany it   7 4  Film and television  Some Dutch films – mainly by director Paul Verhoeven – have received international distribution and recognition  such as Turkish Delight   Turks Fruit    1973   Soldier of Orange   Soldaat van Oranje    1975   Spetters  1980  and The Fourth Man   De Vierde Man    1983   Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood movies like RoboCop and Basic Instinct  and returned with Dutch film Black Book in 2006  Other well known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont  Speed   Dick Maas  De Lift   Fons Rademakers  The Assault   documentary maker Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens

Carice van Houten  Game of Thrones   Rutger Hauer  Blade Runner   Jeroen Krabbé and Derek de Lint   The Netherlands has a well developed television market  with both multiple commercial and non commercial broadcasters  Imported TV programmes  as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language  are virtually always shown with the original sound  and subtitled  The only exception are shows for children  TV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises  most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol  founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende  Headquartered in Amsterdam  Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries  Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality  talent  and game show franchises worldwide  including Big Brother  Deal or No Deal  and The Voice   7 5  Sport  Approximately 4 5 million of the 16 8 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35 000 sports clubs in the country  About two thirds of the population between 15 and 75 participates in sports weekly  Football is the most popular participant sport in the Netherlands  before field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports  Tennis  gymnastics and golf are the three most widely engaged individual sports   Organisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century  Federations for sports were established  such as the speed skating federation in 1882   rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence  A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912  Thus far  the nation has won 266 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 110 medals at the Winter Olympic Games   In international competition Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport  The Netherlands women s hockey team is the most successful team in World Cup history  The Netherlands baseball team have won the European championship 20 times out of 32 events  Dutch K 1 kickboxers have won the K 1 World Grand Prix 15 times out of 19 tournaments   The Dutch speed skaters

Motorcycle racing at the TT Assen Circuit has a long history  Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949  The circuit was purpose built for the Dutch TT in 1954  with previous events having been held on public roads   7 6  Cuisine  Originally  the country s cuisine has been shaped by the practices of fishing and farming  including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals  Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward  and contains many dairy products  Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings  with cereal for breakfast as an alternative  Traditionally  dinner consists of potatoes  a portion of meat  and  seasonal  vegetables   The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat  reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country  Without many refinements  it is best described as rustic  though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods  In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan  with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities   The Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium  It is renowned for its many rich pastries  soups  stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages  renowned for its splendor and great feasts  It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine   In early 2014  Oxfam ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious  plentiful and healthy food  in a comparison of 125 countries   8  Colonial heritage  From the exploitations of the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century  to the colonisations in the 19th century  Dutch imperial possessions continued to expand  reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century  The Dutch East Indies  which later formed modern day Indonesia  was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands  Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands   In the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century  the Netherlands urbanised considerably  mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies  Social status was based on merchants  income  which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society  When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815  much of its wealth came from Colonial trade   Universities such as the Royal Leiden University  founded in the 16th century  have developed into leading knowledge centres for South east Asian and Indonesian studies  Leiden University has produced leading academics such as Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje  and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures  Leiden University and in particular KITLV are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies  Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam Tropenmuseum  an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art  culture  ethnography and anthropology   The traditions of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army  KNIL  are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army  A dedicated Bronbeek Museum  a former home for retired KNIL soldiers  exists in Arnhem to this day   A specific segment of Dutch literature called Dutch Indies literature still exists and includes established authors  such as Louis Couperus  the writer of  The Hidden Force   taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration  One of the great masterpieces of Dutch literature is the book  Max Havelaar   written by Multatuli in 1860   The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are Indo  Eurasian   native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies  This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community  In Dutch they are referred to as Indische Nederlanders or as Indo  short for Indo European    Including their second generation descendants  Indos are currently the largest foreign born group in the Netherlands  In 2008  the Dutch Census Bureau for Statistics  CBS  registered 387 000 first  and second generation Indos living in the Netherlands  Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society  as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands  these  repatriants  have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture   Practically every town in the Netherlands has a  Toko   Dutch Indonesian Shop  or an Indonesian restaurant and many  Pasar Malam   Night market in Malay Indonesian  fairs are organised throughout the year  Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands  Rijsttafel  a colonial culinary concept  and dishes such as Nasi goreng and satay are very popular in the Netherlands   9  See also  Dutch Caribbean  Monarchy of the Netherlands  Outline of the Netherlands  10  References  11  Further reading    Geography and environment  Burke  Gerald L
