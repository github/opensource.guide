In physics  the no cloning theorem is a no go theorem of quantum mechanics that forbids the creation of identical copies of an arbitrary unknown quantum state  It was stated by Wootters and Zurek and Dieks in 1982  and has profound implications in quantum computing and related fields   The state of one system can be entangled with the state of another system  For instance  one can use the controlled NOT gate and the Walsh–Hadamard gate to entangle two qubits  This is not cloning  No well defined state can be attributed to a subsystem of an entangled state  Cloning is a process whose result is a separable state with identical factors  According to Asher Peres and David Kaiser  the publication of the no cloning theorem was prompted by a proposal of Nick Herbert for a superluminal communication device using quantum entanglement   The no cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states  the no broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states   The no cloning theorem has a time reversed dual  the no deleting theorem  Together  these underpin the interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of category theory  and  in particular  as a dagger compact category  This formulation  known as categorical quantum mechanics  allows  in turn  a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to linear logic as the logic of quantum information theory  in the same sense that classical logic  arises from Cartesian closed categories   1  Theorem and proof  Suppose the state of a quantum system A  which we wish to copy  is  see bra–ket notation   In order to make a copy  we take a system B with the same state space and initial state   The initial  or blank  state must be independent of   of which we have no prior knowledge  The state of the composite system is then described by the following tensor product    in the following we will omit the symbol and keep it implicit  There are only two ways to manipulate the composite system  We could perform an observation  which irreversibly collapses the system into some eigenstate of an observable  corrupting the information contained in the qubit s   This is obviously not what we want  Alternatively  we could control the Hamiltonian of the system  and thus the time evolution operator U  for a time independent Hamiltonian    where is called the generator of translations in time  up to some fixed time interval  which yields a unitary operator  Then U acts as a copier provided that  for all possible states in the state space  including    Because U is unitary  it preserves the inner product   and because quantum mechanical states are assumed to be normalized  it follows that  This implies that either  in which case   or is orthogonal to  in which case    However  this cannot be the case for two arbitrary states  although it can hold for certain specific cases  So  for example  choosing orthogonal states in a basis  specifically   and  fit the requirement that   this result does not hold for more general quantum states  Apparently U cannot clone a general quantum state  This proves the no cloning theorem   2  Generalizations  2 1  Mixed states and nonunitary operations  In the statement of the theorem  two assumptions were made  the state to be copied is a pure state and the proposed copier acts via unitary time evolution  These assumptions cause no loss of generality  If the state to be copied is a mixed state  it can be purified  Alternately  a different proof can be given that works directly with mixed states  in this case  the theorem is often known as the no broadcast theorem  Similarly  an arbitrary quantum operation can be implemented via introducing an ancilla and performing a suitable unitary evolution  Thus the no cloning theorem holds in full generality   2 2  Arbitrary sets of states  Non clonability can be seen as a property of arbitrary sets of quantum states  If we know that a system s state is one of the states in some set S  but we do not know which one  can we prepare another system in the same state  If the elements of S are pairwise orthogonal  the answer is always yes  for any such set there exists a measurement which will ascertain the exact state of the system without disturbing it  and once we know the state we can prepare another system in the same state  If S contains two elements that are not pairwise orthogonal  in particular  the set of all quantum states includes such pairs  then an argument like that given above shows that the answer is no   The cardinality of an unclonable set of states may be as small as two  so even if we can narrow down the state of a quantum system to just two possibilities  we still cannot clone it in general  unless the states happen to be orthogonal    Another way of stating the no cloning theorem is that amplification of a quantum signal can only happen with respect to some orthogonal basis  This is related to the emergence of classical probability rules in quantum decoherence   2 3  No cloning in a classical context  There is a classical analogue to the quantum no cloning theorem  which might be stated as follows  given only the result of one flip of a  possibly biased  coin  we cannot simulate a second  independent toss of the same coin  The proof of this statement uses the linearity of classical probability  and has exactly the same structure as the proof of the quantum no cloning theorem  Thus  in order to claim that no cloning is a uniquely quantum result  some care is necessary in stating the theorem  One way of restricting the result to quantum mechanics is to restrict the states to pure states  where a pure state is defined to be one that is not a convex combination of other states  The classical pure states are pairwise orthogonal  but quantum pure states are not   3  Consequences  The no cloning theorem prevents the use of classical error correction techniques on quantum states  For example  backup copies of a state in the middle of a quantum computation cannot be created and used for correcting subsequent errors  Error correction is vital for practical quantum computing  and for some time this was thought to be a fatal limitation  In 1995  Shor and Steane revived the prospects of quantum computing by independently devising the first quantum error correcting codes  which circumvent the no cloning theorem   Similarly  cloning would violate the no teleportation theorem  which says classical teleportation  not to be confused with entanglement assisted teleportation  is impossible  In other words  quantum states cannot be measured reliably   The no cloning theorem is implied by the no communication theorem  which states that quantum information channels cannot be used to transmit classical information  whether superluminally  or slower   That is  cloning is a sufficient condition for such communication to occur  To see this  consider the EPR thought experiment  and suppose quantum states could be cloned  Assume parts of a maximally entangled Bell state are distributed to Alice and Bob  Alice could send bits to Bob in the following way  If Alice wishes to transmit a  0   she measures the spin of her electron in the z direction  collapsing Bob s state to either or   To transmit  1   Alice does nothing to her qubit  Bob creates many copies of his electron s state  and measures the spin of each copy in the z direction  Bob will know that Alice has transmitted a  0  if all his measurements will produce the same result  otherwise  his measurements will have outcomes or with equal probability  This would allow Alice and Bob to communicate classical bits between each other  possibly across space like separations  violating causality    The no cloning theorem prevents an interpretation of the holographic principle for black holes as meaning that there are two copies of information  one lying at the event horizon and the other in the black hole interior  This leads to more radical interpretations  such as black hole complementarity   The no cloning theorem extends to all dagger compact categories  there is no universal cloning morphism for any non trivial category  The result is important  as this category includes things that are not finite dimensional Hilbert spaces  including the category of sets and relations and the category of cobordisms   4  Imperfect cloning  Even though it is impossible to make perfect copies of an unknown quantum state  it is possible to produce imperfect copies  This can be done by coupling a larger auxiliary system to the system that is to be cloned  and applying a unitary transformation to the combined system  If the unitary transformation is chosen correctly  several components of the combined system will evolve into approximate copies of the original system  In 1996  V  Buzek and M  Hillery showed that a universal cloning machine can make a clone of an unknown state with the surprisingly high fidelity of 5 6   Imperfect cloning can be used as an eavesdropping attack on quantum cryptography protocols  among other uses in quantum information science   5  See also  Fundamental Fysiks Group  No broadcast
