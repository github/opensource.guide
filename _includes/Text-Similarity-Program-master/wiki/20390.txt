Burma  also known as Myanmar  is a unitary presidential constitutional republic under its 2008 constitution   1  Political conditions  Historically  Burma was a monarchy ruled by various dynasties prior to the 19th century  The British colonized Burma in the late 19th century  and it was under the jurisdiction of the British Raj until 1937   Burma was ruled as a British colony from 1885 until 1948  While the Bamar heartland was directly administered  first as a part of India and then  from 1937  as British Burma   ethnic regions outside the heartland were allowed some measure of self rule along the lines of the Princely States of India  This led to split loyalties among the various ethnic groups to outside powers  either to the British or Japanese  as well between the indigenous people in Burma  The dominant ethnic group in Burma are the Bamar  who make up approximately sixty eight percent of the population  During World War II  many members of the Bamar ethnic group volunteered to fight alongside the Japanese in hopes of overthrowing the occupying British forces   Meanwhile  many other ethnic groups supported the Allied forces in combating the Japanese and Burman forces  This conflict would come to be very significant in the aftermath of World War Two when Burma was granted its independence from Great Britain in 1948  By granting independence to Burma  the British government gave the new ruler  Aung San  control over areas that were not traditionally controlled by the Bamar  This conglomeration of formerly British owned land created a state that is home to over twenty distinct minority ethnic groups   From the time of the signing of the Burmese Constitution in 1948  ethnic minorities have been denied Constitutional rights  access to lands that were traditionally controlled by their peoples and participation in the government  The various minority ethnic groups have been consistently oppressed by the dominant Burman majority  but have also suffered at the hands of warlords and regional ethnic alliances  Religion also plays a role in the ethnic conflicts that have taken place  Muslims  Hindus  Christians and Buddhists all live in Burma  These religious differences have led to several incidents that have affected hundreds of thousands of citizens in Burma   The SPDC had been responsible for the displacement of several hundred thousand citizens  both inside and outside of Burma  The Karen  Karenni  and Mon ethnic groups have been forced to seek asylum in neighboring Thailand  where they are also abused by an unfriendly and unsympathetic government  These groups are perhaps more fortunate than the Wa and Shan ethnic groups who have become Internally Displaced Peoples in their own state since being removed from lands by the military junta in 2000  There are reportedly 600 000 of these Internally Displaced Peoples living in Burma today  Many are trying to escape forced labour in the military or for one of the many state sponsored drug cartels  This displacement of peoples has led to both human rights violations as well as the exploitation of minority ethnic groups at the hands of the dominant Burman group  The primary actors in these ethnic struggles include but are not limited to the Government of Burma  junta   the Karen National Union and the Mong Tai Army   2  History  2 1  Independence era  On 4 January 1948  Burma achieved independence from Britain  and became a democracy based on the parliamentary system   On the 19th of July 1947  Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma  a transitional government  But in July 1947  political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members  On 4 January 1948  the nation became an independent republic  named the Union of Burma  with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first President and U Nu as its first Prime Minister  Unlike most other former British colonies  it did not become a member of the Commonwealth  A bicameral parliament was formed  consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities  The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement  which combined Burma proper  which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma  and the Frontier Areas  which had been administered separately by the British   2 2  AFPFL Union Government  In 1961  U Thant  then Burma s Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former Secretary to the Prime Minister  was elected Secretary General of the United Nations  he was the first non Westerner to head any international organization and would serve as UN Secretary General for ten years  Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was Secretary General was a young Aung San Suu Kyi   2 3  Military socialist era  In 1962  General Ne Win led a coup d état and established a nominally socialist military government that sought to follow the  Burmese Way to Socialism   The military expropriated private businesses and followed an economic policy of autarky  or economic isolation   There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years and these were almost always violently suppressed  On 7 July 1962  the government broke up demonstrations at Rangoon University  killing 15 students  In 1974  the military violently suppressed anti government protests at the funeral of U Thant  Student protests in 1975  1976 and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force   2 4  SPDC era  The former Head of state was Senior General Than Shwe who held the title of  Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council   His appointed prime minister was Khin Nyunt until 19 October 2004  when he was forcibly deposed in favor of Gen  Soe Win  Almost all cabinet offices are held by military officers   US and European government sanctions against the military government  combined with consumer boycotts and shareholder pressure organized by Free Burma activists  have succeeded in forcing most western corporations to withdraw from Burma  However  some western oil companies remain due to loopholes in the sanctions  For example  the French oil company Total S A  and the American oil company Chevron continue to operate the Yadana natural gas pipeline from Burma to Thailand  Total  formerly TotalFinaElf  is the subject of a lawsuit in French and Belgian courts for alleged complicity in human rights abuses along the gas pipeline  Before it was acquired by Chevron  Unocal settled a similar lawsuit for a reported multi million dollar amount  Asian businesses  such as Daewoo  continue to invest in Burma  particularly in natural resource extraction   The United States and European clothing and shoe industry became the target of Free Burma activists for buying from factories in Burma that were wholly or partly owned by the government or the military  Many stopped sourcing from Burma after protests  starting with Levi Strauss in 1992  From 1992 to 2003  Free Burma activists successfully forced dozens of clothing and shoe companies to stop sourcing from Burma  These companies included Eddie Bauer  Liz Claiborne  Macy s  J  Crew  JoS  A  Banks  Children s Place  Burlington Coat Factory  Wal Mart  and Target  The U S  government banned all imports from Burma as part of the  Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act  of 2003  Sanctions have been criticized for their adverse effects on the civilian population  However  Burmese democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly credited sanctions for putting pressure on the ruling military regime   Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented egregious human rights abuses by the military government  Civil liberties are severely restricted  Human Rights Defenders and Promoters  formed in 2002 to raise awareness among the people of Burma about their human rights  claims that on 18 April 2007  several of its members were met by approximately a hundred people led by a local USDA Secretary U Nyunt Oo and beaten up  The HRDP believes that this attack was condoned by the authorities   There is no independent judiciary in Burma and the military government suppresses political activity  The government restricts Internet access  including blocking of Google  Gmail  Yahoo  and Hotmail  The government uses software based filtering from US company Fortinet to limit the materials citizens can access on line  including free email services  free web hosting and most political opposition and pro democracy pages   In 2001  the government permitted NLD office branches to re open throughout Burma  However  they were shut down or heavily restricted beginning 2004  as part of a government campaign to prohibit such activities  In 2006  many members resigned from NLD  citing harassment and pressure from the Tatmadaw  Armed Forces  and the Union Solidarity and Development Association   The military government placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest again on 31 May 2003  following an attack on her convoy in northern Burma by a mob reported to be in league with the military  The regime extended her house arrest for yet another year in late November 2005  Despite a direct appeal by Kofi Annan to Than Shwe and pressure from ASEAN  the Burmese government extended Aung San Suu Kyi s house arrest another year on 27 May 2006  She was released in 2010   The United Nations urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation  the restoration of democracy  and full respect for human rights  In December 2008  the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the human rights situation in Burma and calling for Aug San Suu Kyi s release—80 countries voting for the resolution  25 against and 45 abstentions  Other nations  such as China and Russia  have been less critical of the regime and prefer to cooperate on economic matters   Facing increasing international isolation  Burma s military government agreed to embark upon a programme of reform  including permitting multiple political parties to contest elections in 2010 and 2012 and the release of political prisoners  However  organisations such as Human Rights Watch allege continued human rights abuses in ongoing conflicts in border regions such as Kachin State   2 5  New constitution  Myanmar s army drafted constitution was overwhelmingly approved  by 92 4% of the 22 million voters with alleged voter turnout of 99%  on 10 May in the first phase of a two stage referendum amid Cyclone Nargis  It was the first national vote since the 1990 election  Multi party elections in 2010 would end 5 decades of military rule  as the new charter gives the military an automatic 25% of seats in parliament  NLD spokesman Nyan Win  inter alia  criticized the referendum   This referendum was full of cheating and fraud across the country  In some villages  authorities and polling station officials ticked the ballots themselves and did not let the voters do anything    2 6  2010 Election  An election was held in 2010  with 40 parties approved to contest the elections by the Electoral Commission  some of which are linked to ethnic minorities  The National League for Democracy  which overwhelmingly won the previous 1990 elections but were never allowed to take power  decided not to participate   The military backed Union Solidarity and Development Party declared victory  winning 259 of the 330 contested seats  The United Nations and many Western countries have condemned the elections as fraudulent  although the decision to hold elections was praised by China and Russia   2 7  2012 By Elections  In by elections held in 2012  the main opposition party National League for Democracy  which was only re registered for the by elections on 13 December 2011 won in 43 of the 44 seats they contested  out of 46   Significantly  international observers were invited to monitor the elections  although the government was criticised for placing too many restrictions on election monitors  some of whom were denied visas   The Union Solidarity and Development Party said it would lodge official complaints to the Union Election Commission on poll irregularities  voter intimidation  and purported campaign incidents that involved National League for Democracy members and supporters  while the National League for Democracy also sent an official complaint to the commission  regarding ballots that had been tampered with   However  President Thein Sein remarked that the by elections were conducted  in a very successful manner   and many foreign countries have indicated willingness to lift or loosen sanctions on Burma and its military leaders   3  Executive branch  The President is the head of state and head of government  He oversees the Cabinet of Burma   3 1  Members of Government of Burma  4  Legislative branch  Under the 2008 Constitution the legislative power of the Union is shared among the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw  State and Region Hluttaws  The Pyidaungsu Hluttaw consists of the People s Assembly  Pyithu Hluttaw  elected on the basis of township as well as population  and the House of Nationalities  Amyotha Hluttaw  with on an equal number

 The House of Nationalities consists of 224 representatives with 56 being military personnel nominated by the Commander in Chief of the Defence Services   5  Judicial system  Burma s judicial system is limited  British era laws and legal systems remain much intact  but there is no guarantee of a fair public trial  The judiciary is independent of the executive branch  Burma does not accept compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction  The highest court in the land is the Supreme Court  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Tun Tun Oo  and Attorney General is Dr Tun Shin   5 1  Wareru dhammathat  Wareru dhammathat or the Manu dhammathat    was the earliest law book in Burma  It consists of laws ascribed to the ancient Indian sage  Manu  and brought to Burma by Hindu colonists  The collection was made at Wareru’s command  by monks from the writings of earlier Mon scholars preserved in the monasteries of his kingdom   Wareru seized Martaban in 1281 and obtained the recognition of China as the ruler of Lower Burma and founded a kingdom which lasted until 1539  Martaban was its first capital  and remained so until 1369  It stretched southwards as far as Tenasserim    5 2  Dhammazedi pyatton  Mon King Dhammazedi  1472–92  was the greatest of the Mon rulers of Wareru’s line  He was famous for his wisdom and the collection of his rulings were recorded in the
