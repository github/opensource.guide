Kurt Friedrich Gödel      April 28  1906 – January 14  1978  was an Austrian  and later American  logician  mathematician  and philosopher  Considered with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history  Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century  a time when others such as Bertrand Russell  A  N  Whitehead  and David Hilbert were pioneering the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics   Gödel published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old  one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna  The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers  for example Peano arithmetic   there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms  To prove this theorem  Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering  which codes formal expressions as natural numbers   He also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory  assuming these axioms are consistent  The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs  He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic  intuitionistic logic  and modal logic   1  Life  1 1  Childhood  Gödel was born April 28  1906  in Brünn  Austria Hungary  now Brno  Czech Republic  into the ethnic German family of Rudolf Gödel  the manager of a textile factory  and Marianne Gödel  born Handschuh   At the time of his birth the city had a German speaking majority which included his parents  The marriage of his parents was confessionally mixed  his father being a Catholic and his mother a Protestant  The children were raised in the Protestant confession  The ancestors of Kurt Gödel were often active in Brünn s cultural life  For example  his grandfather Joseph Gödel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the  Brünner Männergesangverein    Gödel automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I  According to his classmate Klepetař  like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenländer   Gödel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia   He chose to become an Austrian citizen at age 23  When Germany annexed Austria in 1938  Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32  After World War II  at the age of 42  he became an American citizen   In his family  young Kurt was known as Herr Warum   Mr  Why   because of his insatiable curiosity  According to his brother Rudolf  at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever  he completely recovered  but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage   Gödel attended the Evangelische Volksschule  a Lutheran school in Brünn from 1912 to 1916  and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924  excelling with honors in all his subjects  particularly in mathematics  languages and religion  Although Kurt had first excelled in languages  he later became more interested in history and mathematics  His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf  born 1902  left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna  During his teens  Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand  Goethe s Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton  and the writings of Immanuel Kant   1 2  Studying in Vienna  At the age of 18  Gödel joined his brother in Vienna and entered the University of Vienna  By that time  he had already mastered university level mathematics  Although initially intending to study theoretical physics  he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy  During this time  he adopted ideas of mathematical realism  He read Kant s Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft  and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick  Hans Hahn  and Rudolf Carnap  Gödel then studied number theory  but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell s book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy  he became interested in mathematical logic  According to Gödel  mathematical logic was  a science prior to all others  which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences    Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set Gödel s life course  In 1928  Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik  Principles of Mathematical Logic   an introduction to first order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed  Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system   This became the topic that Gödel chose for his doctoral work  In 1929  at the age of 23  he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn s supervision  In it  he established the completeness of the first order predicate calculus  Gödel s completeness theorem   He was awarded his doctorate in 1930  His thesis  along with some additional work  was published by the Vienna Academy of Science   1 3  The Incompleteness Theorem  In 1931 and while still in Vienna  Gödel published his incompleteness theorems in Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der  Principia Mathematica  und verwandter Systeme  called in English  On Formally Undecidable Propositions of  Principia Mathematica  and Related Systems    In that article  he proved for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers  e g  the Peano axioms or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice   that   If the system is consistent  it cannot be complete   The consistency of the axioms cannot be proven within the system  These theorems ended a half century of attempts  beginning with the work of Frege and culminating in Principia Mathematica and Hilbert s formalism  to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics   In hindsight  the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple  Gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system  If it were provable  it would be false  which contradicts the idea that in a consistent system  provable statements are always true  Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement  That is  for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic  that is  a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources   there is a formula that obtains in arithmetic  but which is not provable in that system  To make this precise  however  Gödel needed to produce a method to encode statements  proofs  and the concept of provability as natural numbers  He did this using a process known as Gödel numbering   In his two page paper Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül  1932  Gödel refuted the finite valuedness of intuitionistic logic  In the proof he implicitly used what has later become known as Gödel–Dummett intermediate logic  or Gödel fuzzy logic    1 4  The mid 1930s  further work and visits to the US  Gödel earned his habilitation at Vienna in 1932  and in 1933 he became a Privatdozent  unpaid lecturer  there  In 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany  and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria  and among Vienna s mathematicians  In June 1936  Moritz Schlick  whose seminar had aroused Gödel s interest in logic  was assassinated by a pro Nazi student  This triggered  a severe nervous crisis  in Gödel  He developed paranoid symptoms  including a fear of being poisoned  and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases   In 1933  Gödel first traveled to the U S   where he met Albert Einstein  who became a good friend  He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society  During this year  Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth  This work was developed in number theory  using Gödel numbering   In 1934 Gödel gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study  IAS  in Princeton  New Jersey  entitled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems  Stephen Kleene  who had just completed his PhD at Princeton  took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published   Gödel would visit the IAS again in the autumn of 1935  The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him  and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode  He returned to teaching in 1937  During this time  he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis  he would go on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory   He married Adele Nimbursky  née Porkert  1899–1981   whom he had known for over 10 years  on September 20  1938  Their relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer  six years older than he was   Subsequently  he left for another visit to the USA  spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame   1 5  Relocation to Princeton  Einstein and US citizenship  After the Anschluss in 1938  Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany  Germany abolished the title of Privatdozent  so Gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order  His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle  especially with Hahn  weighed against him  The University of Vienna turned his application down   His predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription  World War II started in September 1939  Before the year was up  Gödel and his wife left Vienna for Princeton  To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing  the Gödels took the trans Siberian railway to the Pacific  sailed from Japan to San Francisco  which they reached on March 4  1940   then crossed the U S  by train to Princeton  where Gödel would accept a position at the Institute for Advanced Study  IAS    Gödel very quickly resumed his mathematical work  In 1940  he published his work Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory  which is a classic of modern mathematics  In that work he introduced the constructible universe  a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets  Gödel showed that both the axiom of choice  AC  and the generalized continuum hypothesis  GCH  are true in the constructible universe  and therefore must be consistent with the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory  ZF   This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians  as it means that they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the Hahn Banach theorem  Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false  together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory   Albert Einstein was also living at Princeton during this time  Gödel and Einstein developed a strong friendship  and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study  The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members  Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his  own work no longer meant much  that he came to the Institute merely     to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel    Gödel and his wife Adele spent the summer of 1942 in Blue Hill  Maine  at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay  Gödel was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work  Using Heft 15  volume 15  of Gödel s still unpublished Arbeitshefte  working notebooks   John W  Dawson  Jr  conjectures that Gödel discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory  a weakened form of set theory  while in Blue Hill in 1942  Gödel s close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture  noting that Gödel s Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem   On December 5  1947  Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied Gödel to his U S  citizenship exam  where they acted as witnesses  Gödel had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the U S  Constitution that would allow the U S  to become a dictatorship  Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend s unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application  Fortunately  the judge turned out to be Phillip Forman  who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein s own citizenship hearing  Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U S  Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman  Forman understood what was going on  cut Gödel off  and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion   1 6  Later years and death  Gödel became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946  Around this time he stopped publishing  though he continued to work  He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976   During his many years at the Institute  Gödel s interests turned to philosophy and physics  In 1949  he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving closed time like curves  to Albert Einstein s field equations in general relativity  He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday  His  rotating universes  would allow time travel to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory  His solutions are known as the Gödel metric  an exact solution of the Einstein field equation    He studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz  but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz s works to be suppressed  To a lesser extent he studied Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl  In the early 1970s  Gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz s version of Anselm of Canterbury s ontological proof of God s existence  This is now known as Gödel s ontological proof  Gödel was awarded  with Julian Schwinger  the first Albert Einstein Award in 1951  and was also awarded the National Medal of Science  in 1974   In later life  Gödel suffered periods of mental instability and illness  He had an obsessive fear of being poisoned  he would eat only food that his wife  Adele  prepared for him  Late in 1977  she was hospitalized for six months and could no longer prepare her husband s food  In her absence  he refused to eat  eventually starving to death  He weighed 65 pounds  approximately 30 kg  when he died  His death certificate reported that he died of  malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance  in Princeton Hospital on January 14  1978  Adele s death followed in 1981   2  Religious views  Gödel was a convinced theist  He held the notion that God was personal  which differed from the religious views of his friend Albert Einstein   He believed firmly in an afterlife  stating   Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today s science and received wisdom haven t any inkling of  But I am convinced of this  the afterlife   independently of any theology   It is  possible today to perceive  by pure reasoning  that it  is entirely consistent with known facts    If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning  then there must be such a thing  as an afterlife     In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire  Gödel described his religion as  baptized Lutheran  but not member of any religious congregation   My belief is theistic  not pantheistic  following Leibniz rather than Spinoza   Describing religion s  in general  Gödel said   Religions are  for the most part  bad—but religion is not   About Islam he said   I like Islam  it is a consistent  or consequential  idea of religion and open minded    3  Legacy  The Kurt Gödel Society  founded in 1987  was named in his honor  It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic  philosophy  and the history of mathematics  The University of Vienna hosts the Kurt Gödel Research Center for Mathematical Logic  The Association for Symbolic Logic has invited an annual Kurt Gödel lecturer each year since 1990   Five volumes of Gödel s collected works have been published  The first two include Gödel s publications  the third includes unpublished manuscripts from Gödel s Nachlass  and the final two include correspondence   A biography of Gödel was published by John Dawson in 2005  Gödel was also one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 BBC documentary entitled Dangerous Knowledge by David Malone   Douglas Hofstadter wrote a popular book in 1979 called Gödel  Escher  Bach to celebrate the work and ideas of Gödel  along with those of artist M  C  Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach  The book partly explores the ramifications of the fact that Gödel s incompleteness theorem can be applied to any Turing complete computational system  which may include the human brain
