Letterboxing is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard width video formats while preserving the film s original aspect ratio  The resulting videographic image has mattes  black bars  above and below it  these mattes are part of the image  i e   of each frame of the video signal   LTBX is the identifying abbreviation for films and images so formatted  The term refers to the shape of a letter box  a slot in a wall or door through which mail is delivered  being rectangular and wider than it is high   1  Description  Letterboxing is used as an alternative to a full screen  pan and scan transfer of a widescreen film image to videotape or videodisc  In pan and scan transfers  the original image is cropped to the narrower aspect ratio of the destination format  usually the 1 33 1  4 3  ratio of the standard television screen  whereas letterboxing preserves the film s original image composition as seen in the cinema  Letterboxing was developed for use in 4 3 television displays before widescreen television screens were available  but it is also necessary to represent on a 16 9 widescreen display the unaltered original composition of a film with a wider aspect ratio  such as Panavision s 2 35 1 ratio   Letterbox mattes are usually symmetrical  both the top and bottom mattes are roughly similar in size   but in some instances the picture can be elevated so the bottom matte is much larger  usually for the purpose of placing  hard  subtitles within the matte to avoid overlapping of the image  This was often done for letterbox widescreen anime on VHS  though the practice of  hiding  subtitles within the lower matte also is done with symmetrical mattes  albeit with less space available  The placing of  soft  subtitles within the picture or matte varies according to the DVD player being used  though it appears to be dependent on the movie for Blu ray disc   2  Early home video use of the letterbox format  The first use of letterbox in consumer video appeared with the RCA videodisc  CED  format  Initially  letterboxing was limited to several key sequences of a film  e g   opening and closing credits   but later it was used for the entire film  The first full letterboxed CED release was Amarcord in 1984  and several others followed  Each disc contained a label noting the use of  RCA s innovative wide screen mastering technique    3  In the cinema and home video  In some countries such as North America  almost all VHS titles were only released in pan and scan versions  However  most later Laserdiscs  from 1987 on  and some VHS releases were released in their original widescreen versions  A good amount of North American NTSC DVD releases  mainly early DVDs  family films  and more popular titles  tend to offer both  Widescreen  and  Fullscreen  versions on the same disc or on a  flipper  format DVD  while most are available in separate versions  Some DVD releases of films are in full screen only  due to whatever existing master is available or basing on what format demographics prefer to see on a certain title  examples being family films such as Matilda and The Thief and the Cobbler   In other territories  such as Europe and Asia  widescreen versions of films on VHS and Laserdisc were much more common in those territories  and is almost ubiquitous on region 2 DVDs   Movies such as The Graduate and Woodstock that made use of the full width of the movie screen often have the sides cut off and look completely different in non letterboxed copies from the original theatrical release  This is more apparent in pan and scanned movies that remain entirely on the center area of the film image   The term  SmileBox  is a registered trademark used to describe a type of letterboxing for Cinerama films  such as on the Blu ray release of How the West Was Won  The image is produced with 3D mapping technology to approximate a curved screen   Currently  with the advent of widescreen HDTV units in almost every household  very few films are being offered in 4 3 and pan and scan releases today  except for older material shot in 4 3 only such as TV shows  made for TV productions  and pre 1953 films  Some titles that were previously released in full screen only on VHS and DVD are now being issued in their original widescreen ratio on recent DVDs and Blu rays   4  On television  Digital broadcasting allows 1 78 1  16 9  widescreen format transmissions without losing resolution  and thus widescreen is becoming the television norm  Most television programming in the United States  Britain and France is in standard definition 16 9 and is transmitted in anamorphic format on digital platforms  When using a 4 3 television  it is possible to display such programming in either a letterbox format or in a 4 3 centre cut format  where the edges of the picture are lost    A letterboxed 14 9 compromise ratio was often broadcast in analogue transmissions in European countries making the transition from 4 3 to 16 9  In addition  recent years have seen an increase of  fake  2 35 1 letterbox mattes on television to give the impression of a cinema film  often seen in adverts  trailers or television programmes such as Top Gear   Current high definition television  HDTV  systems use video displays with a wider aspect ratio than older television sets  making it easier to accurately display widescreen films  In addition to films produced for the cinema  some television programming is produced in high definition and therefore widescreen   On a widescreen television set  a 1 78 1 image fills the screen  however  2 39 1 aspect ratio films are letterboxed with narrow mattes  Because the 1 85 1 aspect ratio does not match the 1 78 1  16 9  aspect ratio of widescreen DVDs and high definition video  slight letterboxing occurs  Usually  such matting of 1 85 1 film is eliminated to match the 1 78 1 aspect ratio in the DVD and HD image transference   Letterbox mattes are not necessarily black  IBM has used blue mattes for many of their TV ads  yellow mattes in their  I am Superman  Lotus ads  and green mattes in ads about efficiency & environmental sustainability  Others uses of colored mattes appear in ads from Allstate  Aleve  and Kodak among others  and in music videos such as Zebrahead s Playmate of the Year  In other instances mattes are animated  such as in the music video for Never Gonna Stop  The Red Red Kroovy   and even parodied such as the final scene of the Crazy Frog Axel F music video in which Crazy Frog peeks over the matte on the lower edge of the screen with part of his hands overlapping the matte  Similar to breaking the border of a comic s panel  it is a form of breaking the fourth wall   The table below shows which TV lines will contain picture information when letterbox pictures are displayed on either 4 3 or 16 9 screens   5  Pillarboxing and windowboxing  Pillarboxing  reversed letterboxing  is the display of an image within a wider image frame by adding lateral mattes  vertical bars at the sides   for example  a 1 33 1 image has lateral mattes when displayed on a 16 9 aspect ratio television screen   An alternative to pillarboxing is  tilt and scan   reversed pan and scan   horizontally matting the original 1 33 1 television images to the 1 78 1 aspect ratio  which at any given moment crops part of the top and or bottom of the frame  hence the need for the  tilt  component  A tilt is a camera move in which the camera tilts up or down   Windowboxing occurs when an image appears centered in a television screen  with blank space on all four sides of the image  such as when a widescreen image that has been previously letterboxed to fit 1 33 1 is then pillarboxed to fit 16 9  It is also called  matchbox    gutterbox   and  postage stamp  display  This occurs on the DVD editions of the Star Trek films on a 4 3 television when the included widescreen documentaries show footage from the original television series  It is also seen in The Crocodile Hunter  Collision Course  which displays widescreen pillarboxing with 1 85 1 scenes in a 2 40 1 frame that is subsequently letterboxed  It is common to see windowboxed commercials on HD television networks  because many commercials are shot in 16 9 but distributed to networks in SD  letterboxed to fit 1 33 1   Many 1980s 8 bit home computers feature gutterboxing display mode  because the TV screens normally used as monitors at that time tended to distort the image near the border of the screen  to such an extent that text displayed in that area became illegible  Moreover  due to the overscanned nature of television video  the precise edges of the visible area of the screen varied from television set to television set  so characters near the expected border of the active screen area might be behind the bezel or off the edge of the screen  The Commodore 64  VIC 20  and Commodore 128  in 40 column mode  featured coloured gutterboxing of the main text window  while the Atari 8 bit family featured a blue text window with a black border  The original IBM PC CGA display adapter was the same  and the monochrome MDA  the predecessor of the CGA  as well as the later EGA and VGA  also featured gutterboxing  this is also called underscanned video  The Fisher Price PXL 2000 camcorder of the late 1980s recorded a windowboxed image to compensate partially for low resolution   Occasionally  an image is deliberately windowboxed for stylistic effect  for example  the documentary style sequence of the film Rent suggest an older format camera representing the 4 3 aspect ratio  and the opening sequence of the Oliver Stone film JFK features pillar boxing to represent the 1960s era 4 3 television footage  The film Sneakers uses a windowboxing effect in a scene for dramatic effect   6  See also  Active Format Description  List of film formats  Motion picture terminology  7  References  8  External links  de Letterbox und Pillarbox eo
