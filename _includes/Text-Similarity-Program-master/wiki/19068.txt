Macau       also spelled Macao  is one of the two Special Administrative Regions of the People s Republic of China  the other being Hong Kong  Macau lies on the western side of the Pearl River Delta across from Hong Kong  which is about 64 kilometers to the east  and it is also bordered by Guangdong Province to the north and the South China Sea to the east and south  With an estimated population of around 624 000 living in an area of 31 3 km2  12 1 sq mi   it is the most densely populated region in the world   A former Portuguese colony  Macau was administered by Portugal from the mid 16th century until late 1999  when it was the last remaining European colony in Asia  Portuguese traders first settled in Macau in the 1550s  In 1557  Macau was rented to Portugal by the Ming Dynasty as a trading port  The Portuguese administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until 1887  when Macau became a colony of the Portuguese Empire  Sovereignty over Macau was transferred back to China on 20 December 1999  The Sino Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of Macau stipulate that Macau operate with a high degree of autonomy until at least 2049  fifty years after the transfer   Under the policy of  one country  two systems   the PRC s Central People s Government is responsible for the territory s defense and foreign affairs  while Macau maintains its own legal system  police force  monetary system  customs policy  and immigration policy  Macau participates in many international organizations and events that do not require members to possess national sovereignty   Macau is one of the world s richest cities  and as of 2013 its GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is higher than that of any country in the world  according to the World Bank  It became the world s largest gambling centre in 2006  with the economy heavily dependent on gambling and tourism  as well as manufacturing  Cantonese people from Hong Kong and Guangdong  in addition to the recent mainland tourism from Mandarin speaking regions  have boosted the economy of Macau significantly  According to The World Factbook  Macau has the second highest life expectancy in the world  Moreover  it is one of only a few regions in Asia with a  very high Human Development Index   ranking 25th as of 2011   1  Etymology  Before the Portuguese settlement in the mid 16th century  Macau was known as Haojing    literally  Oyster Mirror   or Jinghai    literally  Mirror Sea    The name Macau is thought to be derived from the A Ma Temple     a temple built in 1448 dedicated to Matsu – the goddess of seafarers and fishermen  It is said that when the Portuguese sailors landed at the coast just outside the temple and asked the name of the place  the natives replied        The Portuguese then named the peninsula  Macau   The present Chinese name    means  Inlet Gates    2  History  The history of Macau is traced back to the Qin dynasty  221–206 BC   when the region now called Macau came under the jurisdiction of Panyu county  in Nanhai prefecture  present day Guangdong   The first recorded inhabitants of the area were people seeking refuge in Macau from invading Mongols during the Southern Song dynasty  Under the Ming dynasty  1368–1644 AD   fishermen migrated to Macau from Guangdong and Fujian provinces   Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century  In 1513  Jorge Álvares became the first Portuguese to land in China  In 1535  Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau s harbours and to carry out trading activities  though not the right to stay onshore  Around 1552–1553  they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore  in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water  they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van  In 1557  the Portuguese established a permanent settlement in Macau  paying an annual rent of 500 taels  18 9 kilograms41 6 pounds  of silver  The Portuguese continued to pay an annual tribute up to 1863 in order to stay in Macau   By 1564  Portugal commanded western trade with India  Japan  and China  But their pride was shocked by the indifference with which the Chinese treated them  The senate of Macau once complained to the viceroy of Goa of the contempt with which the Chinese authorities treated them  confessing however that  it was owing more to the Portuguese themselves than to the Chinese   In 1631 the Chinese restricted Portuguese commerce in China to the port of Macau   During the 17th century  some 5 000 slaves lived in Macau  in addition to 2 000 Portuguese and 20 000 Chinese   As more Portuguese settled in Macau to engage in trade  they made demands for self administration  but this was not achieved until the 1840s  In 1576  Pope Gregory XIII established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau  In 1583  the Portuguese in Macau were permitted to form a Senate to handle various issues concerning their social and economic affairs under strict supervision of the Chinese authority  but there was no transfer of sovereignty   Macau prospered as a port but it was the target of repeated failed attempts by the Dutch to conquer it in the 17th century  On June 24  1622  the Dutch attacked Macau in the Battle of Macau  in the hope of turning it into a Dutch possession  The Portuguese repulsed their attack and the Dutch never tried to conquer Macau again  The majority of the defenders were African slaves  with only a few Portuguese soldiers and priests  Captain Kornelis Reyerszoon was commander of the 800 Dutch strong invasion force   The Dutch Governor Jan Coen said after the defeat that  The slaves of the Portuguese at Macau served them so well and faithfully  that it was they who defeated and drove away our people there last year   and  Our people saw very few Portuguese  during the battle   Following the Opium War  1839–42   Portugal occupied Taipa and Coloane in 1851 and 1864 respectively  On 1 December 1887  the Qing and Portuguese governments signed the Sino Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce  under which China ceded the right of  perpetual occupation and government of Macau by Portugal  in compliance with the statements of the Protocol of Lisbon  In return  Macau Government would cooperate with Hong Kong s smuggle of Indian opium and China would be able to increase profits through customs taxes  Portugal was also obliged  never to alienate Macau without previous agreement with China   therefore ensuring that negotiation between Portugal and France  regarding a possible exchange of Macau and Portuguese Guinea with the French Congo  or with other countries would not go forward – so that the British commercial interests would be secured  Macau officially became a territory under Portuguese administration   In 1928  after the Qing dynasty had been overthrown following the Xinhai Revolution  the Kuomintang  KMT  government officially notified Portugal that it was abrogating the Treaty of Amity and Commerce  the two powers signed a new Sino Portuguese Friendship and Trade Treaty in place of the abrogated treaty  Making only a few provisions concerning tariff principles and matters relating to business affairs  the new treaty did not alter the sovereignty of Macau and Portuguese government of Macau remained unchanged   During the Second World War  unlike Portuguese Timor which was occupied by the Japanese in 1942 along with Dutch Timor  the Japanese respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau  but only up to a point  As such  Macau enjoyed a brief period of economic prosperity as the only neutral port in South China  after the Japanese had occupied Guangzhou  Canton  and Hong Kong  In August 1943  Japanese troops seized the British steamer Sian in Macau and killed about 20 guards  The next month they demanded the installation of Japanese  advisers  under the alternative of military occupation  The result was that a virtual Japanese protectorate was created over Macau   When it was discovered that neutral Macau was planning to sell aviation fuel to Japan  aircraft from the bombed and strafed the hangar of the Naval Aviation Centre on 16 January 1945 to destroy the fuel  American air raids on targets in Macau were also made on 25 February and 11 June 1945  Following Portuguese government protest  in 1950 the United States paid US$20 255 952 to the government of Portugal  Between the end of the Pacific War and the establishment of the People s Republic of China  Macau served as a safe haven for refugees of the civil war in mainland China   After the establishment of the People s Republic of China in 1949  the Beijing government declared the Sino Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce invalid as an  unequal treaty  imposed by foreigners on China  However  Beijing was not ready to settle the treaty question  leaving the maintenance of  the status quo  until a more appropriate time   Influenced by the Cultural Revolution in mainland China and by general dissatisfaction with Portuguese government  riots broke out in Macau in 1966  In the most serious  the so called 12 3 incident  6 people were killed and more than 200 people were injured  On 28 January 1967  the Portuguese government issued a formal apology by means of an  admission of guilt    Shortly after the overthrow of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974 in Lisbon  the new Portuguese government determined it would relinquish all its overseas possessions  In 1976  Lisbon redefined Macau as a  Chinese territory under Portuguese administration  and granted it a large measure of administrative  financial  and economic autonomy  Three years later  Portugal and China agreed to regard Macau as  a Chinese territory under  temporary  Portuguese administration   The Chinese and Portuguese governments commenced negotiations on the question of Macau in June 1986  The two signed a Sino Portuguese Joint Declaration the next year  making Macau a special administrative region  SAR  of China  The Chinese government assumed formal sovereignty over Macau on 20 December 1999  The economy since then has continued to prosper with the sustained growth of tourism from mainland China and the construction of new casinos   3  Government and politics  The Sino Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law  Macau s constitution promulgated by China s National People s Congress in 1993  specify that Macau s social and economic system  lifestyle  rights  and freedoms are to remain unchanged for at least 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1999  Under the principle of  one country  two systems   Macau enjoys a high degree of autonomy in all areas except in defence and foreign affairs  Macau officials  rather than PRC officials  run Macau through the exercise of separate executive  legislative  and judicial powers  as well as the right to final adjudication  Macau maintains its own separate currency  customs territory  immigration and border controls  and police force   3 1  Executive  The government in Macau is headed by the chief executive  who is appointed by the central government upon the recommendation of an election committee  whose three hundred members are nominated by corporate and community bodies  The recommendation is made by an election within the committee  The chief executive s cabinet is made up of five policy secretaries and is advised by the Executive Council that has between seven and eleven members  Edmund Ho Hau Wah  a community leader and former banker  was the first chief executive of the Macau SAR  replacing General Vasco Rocha Vieira at midnight on 20 December 1999  Fernando Chui Sai On is the current Chief Executive  The chief executive and the cabinet have their offices in the Macau Government Headquarters  located in the area of Freguesia de São Lourenço   3 2  Legislature  The legislative organ of the territory is the Legislative Assembly  a 33 member body comprising 14 directly elected members  12 indirectly elected members representing functional constituencies and seven members appointed by the chief executive  Any permanent residents at or over 18 years of age are eligible to vote in direct elections  Indirect election is limited to organizations registered as  corporate voters  and a 300 member election committee drawn from broad regional groupings  municipal organizations  and central government bodies   3 3  Judiciary  The original framework of the legal system  based largely on Portuguese law or Portuguese civil law system  was preserved after 1999  The territory has its own independent judicial system with a high court  Judges are selected by a committee and appointed by the chief executive  Foreign judges may serve on the courts   Macau has a three tier court system  the Court of the First Instance  the Court of the Second Instance and the Court of Final Appeal  In February 2009  the Legislative Assembly passed a security bill based on the withdrawn security legislation previously introduced in Hong Kong  Democracy advocates feared that the bill s excessively broad scope could lead to abuses  a concern which has been heightened after a number of prominent supporters of democracy in Hong Kong were denied entry into Macau in the run up to the bill s passage   3 4  Military  Under Portuguese rule  Macau often served as an expeditionary base to Japan and other regions of East Asia from the 16th century onwards  while maintaining a strong garrison mainly to repel Dutch and mainland Chinese attacks  However since the allied British settled Hong Kong  the need for a strong military presence in Macau dimmed and it became limited before ceasing in 1974  However  despite having no Portuguese garrison left on the territory  a small security force managed by the local PSP was kept  which proved useful with the escalating triad warfare tensions towards the last decades of Portuguese administration  Also the Capitania dos Portos kept operating a coast guard and the Portuguese airforce kept airfields active until the opening of Macau International Airport in the mid 1990s  In 1999  upon handover to the PRC  a substantial garrison of the People s Liberation Army was established in the city helping deliver the last blow to the violence perpetrated by the triads  who were weakened by police action and arrests prior to the handover  The garrison remains  with a large portion of the forces stationed in neighbouring Zhuhai as well   File 特首辦 jpg Headquarters of

main border crossing between Macau and China is known as the Portas do Cerco  Barrier Gate  on the Macau side  and the Gongbei Port of Entry on the Zhuhai side   Macau Peninsula was originally an island  but a connecting sandbar gradually turned into a narrow isthmus  thus changing Macau into a peninsula  Land reclamation in the 17th century transformed Macau into a peninsula with generally flat terrain  though numerous steep hills still mark the original land mass  Alto de Coloane is the highest point in Macau  with an altitude of   With a dense urban environment  Macau has no arable

the region in 2006 was US$28 436  After the Handover in 1999  there has been a rapid rise in the number of mainland visitors due to China s easing of travel restrictions  Together with the liberalization of Macau s gaming industry in 2001 that induces significant investment inflows  the average growth rate of the economy between 2001 and 2006 was approximately 13 1% annually   In a World Tourism Organization report of international tourism for 2006  Macau ranked 21st in the number of tourists and 24th in terms of tourism receipts  From 9 1 million visitors in 2000  arrivals to

gambling industry had been operated under a government issued monopoly license by Stanley Ho s Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau  The monopoly ended in 2002 and several casino owners from Las Vegas attempted to enter the market  With the opening of the Sands Macao  in 2004 and Wynn Macau in 2006  gambling revenues from Macau s casinos were greatly prosperous  In 2007  Venetian Macau  at the time the second  now seventh  largest building in the world by floor space  opened its doors to the public  followed by MGM Grand Macau  Numerous other hotel casinos  including Galaxy Cotai Megaresort  opened in 2011  and plans for a $3 9 billion complex that will be known as Lisboa Palace is expected to be completed by 2017   In 2002  the Macau government ended the monopoly system and

pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a rate of HK$1   MOP1 03  The name pataca is a Portuguese word which was applied to the Mexican dollars that were the main circulating coin in the wider region in the second half of the 19th century  In 1894  the pataca was introduced in both Macau and Portuguese Timor as a unit of account for the Mexican dollar and the other silver dollar coins in circulation  However  the pataca was not the official currency when it was first enacted  In 1901  it was decided to grant the Banco Nacional Ultramarino the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas  and in the year 1906  all foreign coins were outlawed  However  the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas  being so accustomed to using silver for barter  and as such  the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins  In 1935  when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard  the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence  whereas the pataca was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling  From 1945 to 1951  fractional coins of the pataca were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor  and  in 1952  similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual pataca coin for the first time   7  Demographics  Macau is the most densely populated region in the
