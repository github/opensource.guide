Meitnerium is a chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109  It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element  an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory   The most stable known isotope  meitnerium 278  has a half life of 7 6 seconds  The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt  Germany  first created this element in 1982   In the periodic table  meitnerium is a d block transactinide element  It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements  although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9  Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues  cobalt  rhodium  and iridium   1  History  1 1  Discovery  Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29  1982 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research  Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung  in Darmstadt  The team bombarded a target of bismuth 209 with accelerated nuclei of iron 58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium 266   1 2  Naming  The naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements 104 to 109  but meitnerium was the only proposal and thus was never disputed  The name meitnerium  Mt  was suggested in honor of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner  a co discoverer of protactinium  with Otto Hahn   and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission  In 1994 the name was recommended by IUPAC  and was officially adopted in 1997  It is thus the only element named specifically after a non mythological woman   2  Isotopes  Meitnerium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes  Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory  either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements  Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266  268  270  and 274–278  two of which  meitnerium 268 and meitnerium 270  have known but unconfirmed metastable states  Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay  although some undergo spontaneous fission   2 1  Stability and half lives  All meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive  in general  heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter  The most stable known meitnerium isotope  278Mt  is also the heaviest known meitnerium isotope  it has a half life of 7 6 seconds  A metastable nuclear isomer  270mMt  has been reported to also have a half life of over a second  The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half lives of 0 72 and 0 44 seconds respectively  The remaining four isotopes have half lives between 1 and 20 milliseconds  The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay  however  no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay  Some unknown isotopes  such as 265Mt  272Mt  273Mt  and 279Mt  are predicted to have half lives longer than the known isotopes  Before its discovery  274Mt and 277Mt were also predicted to have long half lives of 20 seconds and 1 minute respectively  however  they were later found to have shorter half lives of only 0 44 seconds and 5 milliseconds respectively   3  Predicted properties  3 1  Chemical  Meitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals  Since element 112  copernicium  has been shown to be a transition metal  it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series  with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals  Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium  thus implying that meitnerium s basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements  cobalt  rhodium  and iridium   Prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently  Meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal  Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements  the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6  +3  and +1 states  with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions  In comparison  rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6  while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium  Group 9 is the first group in the transition metals to show lower oxidation states than the group number  the +9 state not being known for any element  The oxidation state +9 might be possible for meitnerium in the nonafluoride  MtF9  and the  MtO4 + cation  although  IrO4 + is expected to be more stable  The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium  thus also allowing a stable +4 state  It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium  element 107  to darmstadtium  element 110  may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution   3 2  Physical and atomic  Meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face centered cubic crystal structure  similarly to its lighter congener iridium  It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37 4 g cm3  which would be the second highest of any of the 118 known elements  second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium  41 g cm3   In comparison  the densest known element that has had its density measured  osmium  has a density of only 22 61 g cm3  This results from meitnerium s high atomic weight  the lanthanide and actinide contractions  and relativistic effects  although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical  and the sample would quickly decay  Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic   Theoreticians have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10 pm larger than that of iridium  For example  the Mt–O bond distance is expected to be around 1 9 Å  The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 128 pm   4  Experimental chemistry  Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale  One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride     as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride    is volatile above 60 °C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile  a volatile octafluoride    might also be possible  For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide  at least four atoms must be produced  the half life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second  and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week  Even though the half life of 278Mt  the most stable known meitnerium isotope  is 7 6 seconds  long enough to perform chemical studies  another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained  Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and automated systems can then experiment on the gas phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements  some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused  However  the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium   The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons  a magic number for deformed nuclei  its half life was predicted to be a few seconds  long enough for a chemical investigation  However  no atoms of 271Mt were detected  and this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown   An experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues  for example  in the chemical characterization of hassium  hassium tetroxide  HsO4  was compared with the analogous osmium compound  osmium tetroxide  OsO4   In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium  the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium III  oxide  Rh2O3  and rhodium III  chloride  RhCl3   However  macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000 °C and the chloride would not until 780 °C  and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles  these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium  as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500 °C   5  References  6  External links  at The Periodic Table of Videos  University of Nottingham
