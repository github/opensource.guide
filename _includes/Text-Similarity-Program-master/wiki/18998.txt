Myasthenia gravis  from Greek μύς  muscle    weakness   and  serious   abbreviated MG  is either an autoimmune or congenital neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue  In the most common cases  muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction  inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions  Alternatively  in a much rarer form  muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction  that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing it through autoimmunity later in life or through passive transmission by the mother s immune system at birth   Myasthenia is treated medically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants  and  in selected cases  thymectomy  The disease incidence is 3–30 cases per million per year and rising as a result of increased awareness  MG must be distinguished from congenital myasthenic syndromes that can present similar symptoms but do not respond to immunosuppressive treatments   1  Signs and symptoms  The hallmark of myasthenia gravis is fatigability  Muscles become progressively weaker during periods of activity  and improve after periods of rest  Muscles that control eye and eyelid movement  facial expressions  chewing  talking  and swallowing are especially susceptible  The muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements can also be affected  Often  the physical examination yields results within normal limits   The onset of the disorder can be sudden  Often  symptoms are intermittent  The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis may be delayed if the symptoms are subtle or variable  In most cases  the first noticeable symptom is weakness of the eye muscles  In others  difficulty in swallowing and slurred speech may be the first signs  The degree of muscle weakness involved in MG varies greatly among patients  ranging from a localized form that is limited to eye muscles  ocular myasthenia   to a severe and generalized form in which many muscles—sometimes including those that control breathing—are affected  Symptoms  which vary in type and severity  may include asymmetrical ptosis  a drooping of one or both eyelids   diplopia  double vision  due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements  an unstable or waddling gait  weakness in arms  hands  fingers  legs  and neck  a change in facial expression  dysphagia  difficulty in swallowing   shortness of breath  and dysarthria  impaired speech  often nasal due to weakness of the velar muscles    In myasthenic crisis  a paralysis of the respiratory muscles occurs  necessitating assisted ventilation to sustain life  In patients whose respiratory muscles are already weak  crises may be triggered by infection  fever  an adverse reaction to medication  or emotional stress  Myasthenia does not directly affect the heart muscle   2  Pathophysiology  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune channelopathy  it features antibodies directed against proteins that are naturally present in the body  While various similar diseases have been linked to immunologic cross reaction with an infective agent  no known causative pathogen could account for myasthenia  A slight genetic predisposition is present  particular HLA types seem to predispose for MG  B8 and DR3  with DR1 more specific for ocular myasthenia   Up to 75% of patients have an abnormality of the thymus  10% have a thymoma  a tumor  either benign or malignant  of the thymus  and other abnormalities are frequently found  The disease process generally remains stationary after thymectomy  removal of the thymus    In MG  the autoantibodies most commonly act against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  nAChR   the receptor in the motor end plate for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that stimulates muscular contractions  Some forms of the antibody impair the ability of acetylcholine to bind to receptors  Others lead to the destruction of receptors  either by complement fixation or by inducing the muscle cell to eliminate the receptors through endocytosis   The antibodies are produced by plasma cells  derived from B cells  B cells convert into plasma cells by T helper cell stimulation  To carry out this activation  T helpers must first be activated themselves  which is done by binding of the T cell receptor  TCR  to the acetylcholine receptor antigenic peptide fragment  epitope  resting within the major histocompatibility complex of antigen presenting cells  Since the thymus plays an important role in the development of T cells and the selection of TCR  myasthenia gravis is closely associated with thymoma  The exact mechanisms are  however  not convincingly clarified  although removal of the thymus gland  thymectomy  in MG patients without a thymus neoplasm often have positive results   In normal muscle contraction  cumulative activation of the nAChR leads to influx of sodium ions  which in turn causes the depolarization of muscle cell and subsequent opening of voltage gated sodium channels  This ion influx then travels down the cell membranes via T tubules and  via calcium channel complexes  leads to the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum  Only when the levels of calcium inside the muscle cell are high enough will it contract  Decreased numbers of functioning nAChRs  therefore  impair muscular contraction by limiting depolarization  In fact  MG causes the motor neuron action potential to muscular twitch ratio to vary from the nonpathological one to one ratio   A second category of gravis is due to autoantibodies against the MuSK protein  muscle specific kinase   a tyrosine kinase receptor which is required for the formation of the neuromuscular junction  Antibodies against MuSK inhibit the signaling of MuSK normally induced by its nerve derived ligand  agrin  The result is a decrease in patency of the neuromuscular junction  and the consequent symptoms of MG   People treated with penicillamine can develop MG symptoms  Their antibody titer is usually similar to that of MG  but both the symptoms and the titer disappear when drug administration is discontinued   MG is more common in families with other autoimmune diseases  A familial predisposition found in 5% of the cases is associated with certain genetic variations  such as an increased frequency of HLA B8 and DR3  People with MG suffer from coexisting autoimmune diseases at a higher frequency than members of the general population  Of particular mention is coexisting thyroid disease  where episodes of hypothyroidism may precipitate a severe exacerbation   The acetylcholine receptor is clustered and anchored by the Rapsyn protein  research into which might eventually lead to new treatment options   2 1  Associated conditions  Myasthenia gravis is associated with various autoimmune diseases  including   Thyroid diseases  including Hashimoto s thyroiditis and Graves  disease  Diabetes mellitus type 1  Rheumatoid arthritis  Lupus  Demyelinating CNS diseases Seropositive and  double seronegative  patients often have thymoma or thymic hyperplasia  However  anti MuSK positive patients do not have evidence of thymus pathology   2 2  Pregnancy  In the long term  pregnancy does not affect myasthenia gravis  The mothers themselves suffer from exacerbated myasthenia in a third of cases  and in those for whom it does worsen  it usually occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy  Signs and symptoms in pregnant mothers tend to improve during the second and third trimesters  Complete remission can occur in some mothers  Immunosuppressive therapy should be maintained throughout pregnancy  as this reduces the chance of neonatal muscle weakness  as well as controls the mother s myasthenia   Up to 10% of infants with mothers affected by the condition are born with transient  periodic  neonatal myasthenia  TNM   which generally produces feeding and respiratory difficulties  TNM usually presents as poor suckling and generalized hypotonia  low muscle tone   Other reported symptoms include a weak cry  facial diplegia  paralysis of one part of the body  or paresis  impaired or lack of movement   and mild respiratory distress  A child with TNM typically responds very well to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  Very rarely  an infant can be born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita  secondary to profound intrauterine weakness  This is due to maternal antibodies that target an infant s acetylcholine receptors  In some cases  the mother remains asymptomatic   3  Diagnosis  MG can be a difficult diagnosis  as the symptoms can be subtle and hard to distinguish from both normal variants and other neurological disorders  A thorough physical examination can reveal easy fatigability  with the weakness improving after rest and worsening again on repeat of the exertion testing  A good response to medication can also be considered a sign of autoimmune pathology   Three types of myasthenic symptoms in children can be distinguished   Neonatal  In 12% of the pregnancies with a mother with MG  she passes the antibodies to the infant through the placenta  causing neonatal myasthenia gravis  The symptoms start in the first two days and disappear within a few weeks after birth  With the mother  it is not uncommon for the symptoms to even improve during pregnancy  but they might worsen after labor   Congenital  Children of a healthy mother can  very rarely  develop myasthenic symptoms beginning at birth  congenital myasthenic syndrome  CMS   Other than myasthenia gravis  CMS is not caused by an autoimmune process  but due to synaptic malformation  which in turn is caused by genetic mutations  Thus  CMS is a hereditary disease  More than 11 different mutations have been identified  and the inheritance pattern is typically autosomal recessive   Juvenile myasthenia gravis  Myasthenia occurring in childhood  but after the peripartum period The congenital myasthenias cause muscle weakness and fatigability similar to those of MG  The symptoms of CMS usually begin within the first two years of life  although in a few forms  patients can develop their first symptoms as late as the seventh decade of life  A diagnosis of CMS is suggested by   Onset of symptoms in infancy or childhood  Weakness which increases as muscles tire  A decremental EMG response  on low frequency  of the compound muscle action potential  No anti AChR or MuSK antibodies  No response to immunosuppressant therapy  Family history of symptoms which resemble CMS The symptoms of CMS can vary from mild to severe  It is also common for patients with the same form  even members of the same family  to be affected to differing degrees  In most forms of CMS  weakness does not progress  and in some forms  the symptoms may diminish as the patient gets older  Only rarely do symptoms of CMS become worse with time   3 1  Classification  The most widely accepted classification of myasthenia gravis is the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification   Class I  Any eye muscle weakness  possible ptosis  no other evidence of muscle weakness elsewhere  Class II  Eye muscle weakness of any severity  mild weakness of other muscles  Class IIa  Predominantly limb or axial muscles  Class IIb  Predominantly bulbar and or respiratory muscles  Class III  Eye muscle weakness of any severity  moderate weakness of other muscles  Class IIIa  Predominantly limb or axial muscles  Class IIIb  Predominantly bulbar and or respiratory muscles  Class IV  Eye muscle weakness of any severity  severe weakness of other muscles  Class IVa  Predominantly limb or axial muscles  Class IVb  Predominantly bulbar and or respiratory muscles  Can also include feeding tube without intubation   Class V  Intubation needed to maintain airway  3 2  Physical examination  Many muscles can be tested for muscle fatigability  A thorough investigation includes   looking upward and sidewards for 30 seconds  ptosis and diplopia  looking at the feet while lying on the back for 60 seconds  keeping the arms stretched forward for 60 seconds  ten deep knee bends  walking 30 steps on both the toes and the heels  five situps  lying down and sitting up completely   peek sign    after complete initial apposition of the lid margins  they quickly  within 30 seconds  start to separate and the sclera starts to show  3 3  Blood tests  If the diagnosis is suspected  serology can be performed to identify certain antibodies   One test is for antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor  The test has a reasonable sensitivity of 80–96%  but in ocular myasthenia  the sensitivity falls to 50%  negative in up to 50% who have MG    A proportion of the patients without antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor have antibodies against the MuSK protein   In specific situations  decreased reflexes which increase on facilitation  coexisting autonomic features  suspected presence of neoplasm  especially of the lung  presence of increment or facilitation on repetitive electromyography   testing is performed for Lambert Eaton syndrome  in which other antibodies  against a voltage gated calcium channel  can be found   3 4  Electrodiagnostics  Muscle fibers of patients with MG are easily fatigued  thus do not respond as well as muscles in healthy individuals to repeated stimulation  By stimulating a nerve muscle motor unit with short sequences of rapid  regular electrical impulses  before and after exercising the motor unit  the fatiguability of the muscle can be measured  This is called the repetitive nerve stimulation test  In single fiber electromyography  which is considered to be the most sensitive  although not the most specific  test for MG  a thin needle electrode is inserted into different areas of a particular muscle to record the action potentials from several samplings of different individual muscle fibers  Two muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit are identified and the temporal variability in their firing patterns are measured  Frequency and proportion of particular abnormal action potential patterns   jitter  and  blocking   are diagnostic  Jitter refers to the abnormal variation in the time interval between action potentials of adjacent muscle fibers in the same motor unit  Blocking refers to the failure of nerve impulses to elicit action potentials in adjacent muscle fibers of the same motor unit   3 5  Ice test  Applying ice to weak muscle groups characteristically leads to improvement in strength of those muscles  Applying ice for five minutes to the muscles reportedly has a sensitivity and specificity of 76 9% and 98 3%  respectively  for the identification of MG  Acetylcholinesterase is thought to be inhibited at the lower temperature  and this is the basis for this diagnostic test   3 6  Edrophonium test  The  edrophonium test  is infrequently performed to identify MG  its application is limited to those situations in which other investigations have failed to yield a conclusive diagnosis  This test requires the intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride  Tensilon  Reversol  or neostigmine  Prostigmin   drugs that block the breakdown of acetylcholine by cholinesterase  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction  In people with myasthenia gravis involving the eye muscles  edrophonium chloride will briefly relieve weakness   3 7  Imaging  A chest X ray is frequently performed  it may point towards alternative diagnoses  e g   Lambert Eaton syndrome due to a lung tumor  and comorbidity  It may also identify widening of the mediastinum suggestive of thymoma  but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  are more sensitive ways to identify thymomas and are generally done for this reason  MRI of the cranium and orbits may also be performed to exclude compressive and inflammatory lesions of the cranial nerves and ocular muscles   3 8  Pulmonary function test  Spirometry  lung function testing  may be performed to assess respiratory function if concerns exist about breathing adequacy  The forced vital capacity may be monitored at intervals to detect increasing muscular weakness  Acutely  negative inspiratory force may be used to determine adequacy of ventilation  Severe myasthenia may cause respiratory failure due to exhaustion of the respiratory muscles   3 9  Pathological findings  Muscle biopsy is only performed if the diagnosis remains in doubt and clinical suspicion of MG persists  Immunofluorescence shows IgG antibodies on the neuromuscular junction   The antibody which causes myasthenia gravis does not fluoresce  but rather a secondary antibody directed against it   Muscle electron microscopy shows receptor infolding and loss of the tips of the folds  together with widening of the synaptic clefts  Both these techniques are currently used for research rather than diagnostically   4  Management  Treatment is by medication and or surgery  Medication consists mainly of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to directly improve muscle function and immunosuppressant drugs to reduce the autoimmune process  Thymectomy is a surgical method to treat MG  For emergency treatment  plasmapheresis or IVIG can be used as a temporary measure to remove antibodies from the blood circulation   4 1  Medication  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can provide symptomatic benefit  Neostigmine and pyridostigmine improve muscle function  they act by slowing the normal degradation of acetylcholine at nerve endings  thereby overcoming the inhibition of the receptors  Usually  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are started at a low dose and increase until the desired result is achieved  If taken 30 minutes before a meal  symptoms will be mild during eating  Side effects  such as perspiration and diarrhea  can be countered by adding atropine  Pyridostigmine is a short lived drug  with a half life of about four hours  There have been few high quality studies directly comparing cholinesterase inhibitors with other treatments  or placebo   it has been suggested that their practical benefit is such that it would be difficult conducting studies in which they would be withheld from some people   Many people with immune mediated myasthenia are treated with immunosuppressive drugs  such as prednisone prednisolone  cyclosporin  mycophenolate  and azathioprine  People are commonly treated with a combination of these drugs with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  Treatments with some immunosuppressives take weeks to months before effects are noticed   4 2  Plasmapheresis and IVIG  If the myasthenia is serious  myasthenic crisis   plasmapheresis can be used to remove the putative antibodies from the circulation  Also  intravenous immunoglobulins  IVIGs  can be used to bind the circulating antibodies  Both of these treatments have relatively short lived benefits  typically measured in weeks   4 3  Surgery  Thymectomy  the surgical removal of the thymus  is essential in cases of thymoma in view of the potential neoplastic effects of the tumor  However  the procedure is more controversial in patients who do not show thymic abnormalities  Although some of these patients improve following thymectomy  other patients experience severe exacerbations and the highly controversial concept of  therapeutic thymectomy  for patients with thymus hyperplasia is disputed by many experts  and efforts are underway to unequivocally answer this important question   The surgical approaches to the removal of the thymus gland include  transsternal  through the sternum  transcervical  through a small neck incision   and transthoracic  through one or both sides of the chest   The transsternal approach is most common and uses the same length wise incision through the breast bone used for most open heart surgery  The transcervical approach  a less invasive procedure  allows for removal of the entire thymus gland through a small neck incision  No difference in success in symptom improvement has been shown between the transsternal approach and the minimally invasive transcervical approach  For patients with a thymoma  though  complete tissue removal is important  as thymic tissue can regrow  Thymomas can be malignant and are thought to be the onset of other diseases  as well  so many surgeons will only recommend the full sternotomy approach to a thymectomy   Thymoma is relatively rare in younger   40  patients  but especially younger patients with generalized MG without thymoma benefit  paradoxically  from thymectomy  Resection is also indicated for those with a thymoma  but it is less likely to improve the MG symptoms   4 4  Physical measures  Patients with MG should be educated regarding the fluctuating nature of their symptoms  including weakness and exercise induced fatigue  Exercise participation should be encouraged with frequent rest   In people with generalized MG  some evidence indicates a partial home program including training in diaphragmatic breathing  pursed lip breathing  and interval based muscle therapy may improve respiratory muscle strength  chest wall mobility  respiratory pattern  and respiratory endurance   5  Prognosis  With treatment  patients have a normal life expectancy  except for those with a malignant thymoma  whose lesser life expectancy is on account of the thymoma itself and is otherwise unrelated to the myasthenia   Quality of life can vary depending on the severity and the cause  The drugs used to control MG either diminish in effectiveness over time  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  or cause severe side effects of their own  immunosuppressants   About 10% of MG patients are found to have tumors in their thymus glands  in which case a thymectomy is a very effective treatment with long term remission  However  most patients need treatment for the remainder of their lives  and their abilities vary greatly  MG is not usually a progressive disease  the symptoms may fluctuate  but do not always get worse as the patient ages  For some  the symptoms decrease after a span of three to five years   6  Epidemiology  Myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both sexes  It most commonly affects women under 40 and people from 50 to 70 years old of either sex  but it has been known to occur at any age  Younger patients rarely have thymoma  The prevalence in the United States is estimated at 20 cases per 100 000  Risk factors are the female sex with ages 20 – 40  familial myasthenia gravis  D penicillamine ingestion  drug induced myasthenia   and having other autoimmune diseases   7  Research directions  Immunomodulating substances  such as drugs that prevent acetylcholine receptor modulation by the immune system  are currently being researched   Ephedrine seems to help some people but it has not been properly studied as of 2014   8  Notable cases  Brandon
