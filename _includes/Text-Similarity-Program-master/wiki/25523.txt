Richard Phillips Feynman    May 11  1918 – February 15  1988  was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics  the theory of quantum electrodynamics  and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium  as well as in particle physics  he proposed the parton model   For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics  Feynman  jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin Itiro Tomonaga  received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965  He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles  which later became known as Feynman diagrams  During his lifetime  Feynman became one of the best known scientists in the world  In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time   He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission  the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster  In addition to his work in theoretical physics  Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing  and introducing the concept of nanotechnology  He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology   Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures  notably a 1959 talk on top down nanotechnology called There s Plenty of Room at the Bottom  and the three volume publication of his undergraduate lectures  The Feynman Lectures on Physics  Feynman also became known through his semi autobiographical books Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman  and What Do You Care What Other People Think  and books written about him  such as Tuva or Bust    1  Early life  Richard Phillips Feynman was born on May 11  1918  in New York City  the son of Lucille  née Phillips   a homemaker  and Melville Arthur Feynman  a sales manager  His family originated from Russia and Poland  both of his parents were Ashkenazi Jews  They were not religious  and by his youth Feynman described himself as an  avowed atheist    Feynman was a late talker  and by his third birthday had yet to utter a single word  He would retain a Bronx accent as an adult  That accent was thick enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration — so much so that his good friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe would one day comment that Feynman spoke like a  bum    The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father  who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking  and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new  From his mother he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life  As a child  he had a talent for engineering  maintained an experimental laboratory in his home  and delighted in repairing radios  When he was in grade school  he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands   When Richard was five years old  his mother gave birth to a younger brother  but this brother died at four weeks of age  Four years later  Richard gained a sister  Joan  and the family moved to Far Rockaway  Queens  Though separated by nine years  Joan and Richard were close  as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world  Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things  Despite their mother s disapproval of Joan s desire to study astronomy  Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe  Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind   2  Education  Upon starting high school  Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class and an unspecified school administered IQ test estimated his IQ at 125—high  but  merely respectable  according to biographer James Gleick  In 1933  when he turned 15  he taught himself trigonometry  advanced algebra  infinite series  analytic geometry  and both differential and integral calculus  Before entering college  he was experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as the half derivative using his own notation  In high school he was developing the mathematical intuition behind his Taylor series of mathematical operators   His habit of direct characterization sometimes rattled more conventional thinkers  for example  one of his questions  when learning feline anatomy  was  Do you have a map of the cat    referring to an anatomical chart    Feynman attended Far Rockaway High School  a school also attended by fellow laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg  A member of the Arista Honor Society  in his last year in high school Feynman won the New York University Math Championship  the large difference between his score and those of his closest competitors shocked the judges   He applied to Columbia University but was not accepted because of their quota for the number of Jews admitted  Instead  he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  where he received a bachelor s degree in 1939 and in the same year was named a Putnam Fellow   He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to Princeton University in mathematics and physics—an unprecedented feat—but did rather poorly on the history and English portions  Attendees at Feynman s first seminar included Albert Einstein  Wolfgang Pauli  and John von Neumann  He received a Ph D  from Princeton in 1942  his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler  Feynman s thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics  inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics  laying the groundwork for the  path integral  approach and Feynman diagrams  and was titled  The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics    3  Manhattan Project  At Princeton  the physicist Robert R  Wilson encouraged Feynman to participate in the Manhattan Project—the wartime U S  Army project at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb  Feynman said he was persuaded to join this effort to build it before Nazi Germany developed their own bomb  He was assigned to Hans Bethe s theoretical division and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader  He and Bethe developed the Bethe–Feynman formula for calculating the yield of a fission bomb  which built upon previous work by Robert Serber   He immersed himself in work on the project  and was present at the Trinity bomb test  Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder s lenses provided  reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield  as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation  On witnessing the blast  Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion  where he saw a temporary  purple splotch  afterimage of the event   As a junior physicist  he was not central to the project  The greater part of his work was administering the computation group of human computers in the theoretical division  one of his students there  John G  Kemeny  later went on to co design and co specify the programming language BASIC   Later  with Nicholas Metropolis  he assisted in establishing the system for using IBM punched cards for computation   Feynman s other work at Los Alamos included calculating neutron equations for the Los Alamos  Water Boiler   a small nuclear reactor  to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality  On completing this work he was transferred to the Oak Ridge facility  where he aided engineers in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents  for example  due to sub critical amounts of fissile material inadvertently stored in proximity on opposite sides of a wall  could be avoided  He also did theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb  which later proved not to be feasible   Feynman was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one on one discussions  He later discovered the reason  most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him  Feynman had no such inhibitions  vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr s thinking  Feynman said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else  but once anyone got him talking about physics  he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties   Due to the top secret nature of the work  Los Alamos was isolated  In Feynman s own words   There wasn t anything to do there   Bored  he indulged his curiosity by learning to pick the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers  Feynman played many jokes on colleagues  In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use  it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms  e   2 71828…   and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination  He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank  which initially spooked his colleague  Frederic de Hoffmann  into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets  On several occasions  Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from Klaus Fuchs  who was later discovered to be a real spy for the Soviets  transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe   On occasion  Feynman would find an isolated section of the mesa where he could drum in the style of American natives   and maybe I would dance and chant  a little   These antics did not go unnoticed  and rumors spread about a mysterious Indian drummer called  Injun Joe   He also became a friend of the laboratory head  J  Robert Oppenheimer  who unsuccessfully tried to court him away from his other commitments after the war to work at the University of California  Berkeley   Feynman alludes to his thoughts on the justification for getting involved in the Manhattan project in The Pleasure of Finding Things Out  He felt the possibility of Nazi Germany developing the bomb before the Allies was a compelling reason to help with its development for the U S  He goes on to say  however  that it was an error on his part not to reconsider the situation once Germany was defeated  In the same publication  Feynman also talks about his worries in the atomic bomb age  feeling for some considerable time that there was a high risk that the bomb would be used again soon  so that it was pointless to build for the future  Later he describes this period as a  depression    4  Early academic career  Following the completion of his Ph D  in 1942  Feynman held an appointment at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as an assistant professor of physics  The appointment was spent on leave for his involvement in the Manhattan project  In 1945  he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to UW to teach in the coming academic year  His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to return  In a talk given several years later at UW  Feynman quipped   It s great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me    After the war  Feynman declined an offer from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  New Jersey  despite the presence there of such distinguished faculty members as Albert Einstein  Kurt Gödel and John von Neumann  Feynman followed Hans Bethe  instead  to Cornell University  where Feynman taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950  During a temporary depression following the destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb produced by the Manhattan Project  he focused on complex physics problems  not for utility  but for self satisfaction  One of these was analyzing the physics of a twirling  nutating dish as it is moving through the air  His work during this period  which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds  proved important to his Nobel Prize winning work  yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems  he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities   Despite yet another offer from the Institute for Advanced Study  Feynman rejected the Institute on the grounds that there were no teaching duties  Feynman felt that students were a source of inspiration and teaching was a diversion during uncreative spells  Because of this  the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University jointly offered him a package whereby he could teach at the university and also be at the institute  Feynman instead accepted an offer from the California Institute of Technology  Caltech —and as he says in his book Surely You re Joking Mr  Feynman —because a desire to live in a mild climate had firmly fixed itself in his mind while he was installing tire chains on his car in the middle of a snowstorm in Ithaca   Feynman has been called the  Great Explainer   He gained a reputation for taking great care when giving explanations to his students and for making it a moral duty to make the topic accessible  His guiding principle was that  if a topic could not be explained in a freshman lecture  it was not yet fully understood  Feynman gained great pleasure from coming up with such a  freshman level  explanation  for example  of the connection between spin and statistics  What he said was that groups of particles with spin ½  repel   whereas groups with integer spin  clump   This was a brilliantly simplified way of demonstrating how Fermi–Dirac statistics and Bose–Einstein statistics evolved as a consequence of studying how fermions and bosons behave under a rotation of 360°  This was also a question he pondered in his more advanced lectures  and to which he demonstrated the solution in the 1986 Dirac memorial lecture  In the same lecture  he further explained that antiparticles must exist  for if particles had only positive energies  they would not be restricted to a so called  light cone    He opposed rote learning or unthinking memorization and other teaching methods that emphasized form over function  Clear thinking and clear presentation were fundamental prerequisites for his attention  It could be perilous even to approach him when unprepared  and he did not forget the fools or pretenders   5  Caltech years  Feynman did significant work while at Caltech  including research in   Quantum electrodynamics  The theory for which Feynman won his Nobel Prize is known for its accurate predictions  This theory was begun in the earlier years during Feynman s work at Princeton as a graduate student and continued while he was at Cornell  This work consisted of two distinct formulations  and it is a common error to confuse them or to merge them into one  The first is his path integral formulation  actually  Feynman couldn t formulate QED as a Feynman Integral since that involves super Feynman Integrals which were developed by others in the 50 s   and the second is the formulation of his Feynman diagrams  Both formulations contained his sum over histories method in which every possible path from one state to the next is considered  the final path being a sum over the possibilities  also referred to as sum over paths   For a number of years he lectured to students at Caltech on his path integral formulation of quantum theory  The second formulation of quantum electrodynamics  using Feynman diagrams  was specifically mentioned by the Nobel committee  The logical connection with the path integral formulation is interesting  Feynman did not prove that the rules for his diagrams followed mathematically from the path integral formulation  Some special cases were later proved by other people  but only in the real case  so the proofs don t work when spin is involved  The second formulation should be thought of as starting anew  but guided by the intuitive insight provided by the first formulation  Freeman Dyson published a paper in 1949 which  among many other things  added new rules to Feynman s which told how to actually implement renormalization  Students everywhere learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created  Eventually computer programs were written to compute Feynman diagrams  providing a tool of unprecedented power  It is possible to write such programs because the Feynman diagrams constitute a formal language with a grammar  Marc Kac provided the formal proofs of the summation under history  showing that the parabolic partial differential equation can be reexpressed as a sum under different histories  that is  an expectation operator   what is now known as the Feynman Kac formula  the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications of stochastic processes   Physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium  where helium seems to display a complete lack of viscosity when flowing  Feynman provided a quantum mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist Lev D  Landau’s theory of superfluidity  Applying the Schrödinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale  This helped with the problem of superconductivity  however  the solution eluded Feynman  It was solved with the BCS theory of superconductivity  proposed by John Bardeen  Leon Neil Cooper  and John Robert Schrieffer   A model of weak decay  which showed that the current coupling in the process is a combination of vector and axial currents  an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron  a proton  and an anti neutrino   Although E  C  George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously  Feynman s collaboration with Murray Gell Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was neatly described by the vector and axial currents  It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation  He also developed Feynman diagrams  a bookkeeping device which helps in conceptualizing and calculating interactions between particles in spacetime  notably the interactions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts  positrons  This device allowed him  and later others  to approach time reversibility and other fundamental processes  Feynman s mental picture for these diagrams started with the hard sphere approximation  and the interactions could be thought of as collisions at first  It was not until decades later that physicists thought of analyzing the nodes of the Feynman diagrams more closely  Feynman famously painted Feynman diagrams on the exterior of his van   From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime  Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces  Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model  The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell Mann  The relationship between the two models was murky  Gell Mann referred to Feynman s partons derisively as  put ons   In the mid 1960s  physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers  not real particles  as the statistics of the Omega minus particle  if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together  seemed impossible if quarks were real  The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed  analogously to Ernest Rutherford s experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911  that nucleons  protons and neutrons  contained point like particles which scattered electrons  It was natural to identify these with quarks  but Feynman s parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way which did not introduce additional hypotheses  For example  the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon  These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons which carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three valued color quantum number which solves the Omega minus problem  Feynman did not dispute the quark model  for example  when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977  Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark  which was duly discovered in the decade after his death   After the success of quantum electrodynamics  Feynman turned to quantum gravity  By analogy with the photon  which has spin 1  he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field  and derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity  but little more  However  the computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity   ghosts   which are  particles  in the interior of his diagrams which have the  wrong  connection between spin and statistics  have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the Yang–Mills theories  for example  QCD and the electro weak theory   In 1965  Feynman was appointed a foreign member of the Royal Society  At this time in the early 1960s  Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time  including a request  while at Caltech  to  spruce up  the teaching of undergraduates  After three years devoted to the task  he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics  He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book  Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image  the publishers changed the cover to plain red  though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword  The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists  Robert B  Leighton and Matthew Sands  as part time co authors for several years  Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks  they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics  As of 2005  The Feynman Lectures on Physics has sold over 1 5 million copies in English  an estimated 1 million copies in Russian  and an estimated half million copies in other languages  Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books  including The Character of Physical Law  QED  The Strange Theory of Light and Matter  Statistical Mechanics  Lectures on Gravitation  and the Feynman Lectures on Computation   Feynman s students competed keenly for his attention  he was once awakened when a student solved a problem and dropped it in his mailbox  glimpsing the student sneaking across his lawn  he could not go back to sleep  and he read the student s solution  The next morning his breakfast was interrupted by another triumphant student  but Feynman informed him that he was too late   Partly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics  Feynman offered $1 000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology  one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman  He was also one of the first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers   In 1974  Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of cargo cult science  which has the semblance of science  but is only pseudoscience due to a lack of  a kind of scientific integrity  a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty  on the part of the scientist  He instructed the graduating class that  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool  So you have to be very careful about that  After you ve not fooled yourself  it s easy not to fool other scientists  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that    In 1984–86  he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong coupling expansions  variational perturbation theory  and  as a consequence  to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments   In the late 1980s  according to  Richard Feynman and the Connection Machine   Feynman played a crucial role in developing the first massively parallel computer  and in finding innovative uses for it in numerical computations  in building neural networks  as well as physical simulations using cellular automata  such as turbulent fluid flow   working with Stephen Wolfram at Caltech  His son Carl also played a role in the development of the original Connection Machine engineering  Feynman influencing the interconnects while his son worked on the software   Feynman diagrams are now fundamental for string theory and M theory  and have even been extended topologically  The world lines of the diagrams have developed to become tubes to allow better modeling of more complicated objects such as strings and membranes  Shortly before his death  Feynman criticized string theory in an interview   I don t like that they re not calculating anything   he said   I don t like that they don t check their ideas  I don t like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment  they cook up an explanation—a fix up to say  ‘Well  it still might be true    These words have since been much quoted by opponents of the string theoretic direction for particle physics   6  Challenger disaster  Feynman played an important role on the Presidential Rogers Commission  which investigated the Challenger disaster  During a televised hearing  Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle s O rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice cold water  The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral   Feynman devoted the latter half of his book What Do You Care What Other People Think  to his experience on the Rogers Commission  straying from his usual convention of brief  light hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative  Feynman s account reveals a disconnect between NASA s engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected  His interviews of NASA s high ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts  For instance  NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100 000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle  but Feynman discovered that NASA s own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200  He concluded that the space shuttle reliability estimate by NASA management was fantastically unrealistic  and he was particularly angered that NASA used these figures to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher in Space program  He warned in his appendix to the commission s report  which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report    For a successful technology  reality must take precedence over public relations  for nature cannot be fooled    A television documentary drama named The Challenger  US title  The Challenger Disaster   detailing Feynman s part in the investigation  was aired in 2013   7  Cultural identification  Although born to and raised by parents who were Ashkenazi  Feynman was not only an atheist  but declined to be labelled Jewish  He routinely refused to be included in lists or books that classified people by race  He asked to not be included in Tina Levitan s The Laureates  Jewish Winners of the Nobel Prize  writing   To select  for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory   and adding     at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views  but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way  the chosen people     8  Personal life  While researching for his Ph D   Feynman married his first wife  Arline Greenbaum  often misspelled Arlene   They married knowing that Arline was seriously ill from tuberculosis  of which she died in 1945  In 1946  Feynman wrote a letter to her  but kept it sealed for the rest of his life  This portion of Feynman s life was portrayed in the 1996 film Infinity  which featured Feynman s daughter  Michelle  in a cameo role   He married a second time in June 1952  to Mary Louise Bell of Neodesha  Kansas  this marriage was unsuccessful   He later married Gweneth Howarth  1934–1989  from Ripponden  Yorkshire  who shared his enthusiasm for life and spirited adventure  Besides their home in Altadena  California  they had a beach house in Baja California  purchased with the prize money from Feynman s Nobel Prize  his one third share of $55 000  They remained married until Feynman s death  They had a son  Carl  in 1962  and adopted a daughter  Michelle  in 1968   Feynman had a great deal of success teaching Carl  using  for example  discussions about ants and Martians as a device for gaining perspective on problems and issues  He was surprised to learn that the same teaching devices were not useful with Michelle  Mathematics was a common interest for father and son  they both entered the computer field as consultants and were involved in advancing a new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problems—later known as parallel computing  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory retained Feynman as a computational consultant during critical missions  One co worker characterized Feynman as akin to Don Quixote at his desk  rather than at a computer workstation  ready to do battle with the windmills   Feynman traveled widely  notably to Brazil  where he gave courses at the CBPF  Brazilian Center for Physics Research  and near the end of his life schemed to visit the Russian land of Tuva  a dream that  because of Cold War bureaucratic problems  never became reality  The day after he died  a letter arrived for him from the Soviet government  giving him authorization to travel to Tuva  Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase  Tuva or Bust   also the title of a book about his efforts to get there   which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they  one day  could see it firsthand  The documentary movie  Genghis Blues  mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends   Responding to Hubert Humphrey s congratulation for his Nobel Prize  Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president  In a letter to an MIT professor dated December 6  1966  Feynman expressed interest in running for governor of California   Feynman took up drawing at one time and enjoyed some success under the pseudonym  Ofey   culminating in an exhibition of his work  He learned to play a metal percussion instrument  frigideira  in a samba style in Brazil  and participated in a samba school   In addition  he had some degree of synesthesia for equations  explaining that the letters in certain mathematical functions appeared in color for him  even though invariably printed in standard black and white   According to Genius  the James Gleick authored biography  Feynman tried LSD during his professorship at Caltech  Somewhat embarrassed by his actions  he largely sidestepped the issue when dictating his anecdotes  he mentions it in passing in the  O Americano  Outra Vez  section  while the  Altered States  chapter in Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman  describes only marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly s famed sensory deprivation tanks  as a way of studying consciousness  Feynman gave up alcohol when he began to show vague  early signs of alcoholism  as he did not want to do anything that could damage his brain—the same reason given in  O Americano  Outra Vez  for his reluctance to experiment with LSD   In Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman   he gives advice on the best way to pick up a girl in a hostess bar  At Caltech  he used a nude or topless bar as an office away from his usual office  making sketches or writing physics equations on paper placemats  When the county officials tried to close the place  all visitors except Feynman refused to testify in favor of the bar  fearing that their families or patrons would learn about their visits  Only Feynman accepted  and in court  he affirmed that the bar was a public need  stating that craftsmen  technicians  engineers  common workers   and a physics professor  frequented the establishment  While the bar lost the court case  it was allowed to remain open as a similar case was pending appeal   Feynman has a minor acting role in the film Anti Clock credited as  The Professor    9  Death  Feynman had two rare forms of cancer  liposarcoma and Waldenström s macroglobulinemia  dying shortly after a final attempt at surgery for the former on February 15  1988  aged 69  His last recorded words are noted as   I d hate to die twice  It s so boring    10  Popular legacy  Actor Alan Alda commissioned playwright Peter Parnell to write a two character play about a fictional day in the life of Feynman set two years before Feynman s death  The play  QED  which was based on writings about Richard Feynman s life during the 1990s  premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles  California in 2001  The play was then presented at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Broadway  with both presentations starring Alda as Richard Feynman   On May 4  2005  the United States Postal Service issued the American Scientists commemorative set of four 37 cent self adhesive stamps in several configurations  The scientists depicted were Richard Feynman  John von Neumann  Barbara McClintock  and Josiah Willard Gibbs  Feynman s stamp  sepia toned  features a photograph of a 30 something Feynman and eight small Feynman diagrams  The stamps were designed by Victor Stabin under the artistic direction of Carl T  Herrman   The main building for the Computing Division at Fermilab is named the  Feynman Computing Center  in his honor   The principal character in Thomas A  McMahon s 1970 novel  Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry  A Novel  is modeled on Feynman   Real Time Opera premiered its opera Feynman at the Norfolk  CT  Chamber Music Festival in June 2005   In February 2008 LA Theatre Works released a recording of  Moving Bodies  with Alfred Molina in the role of Richard Feynman  This radio play written by playwright Arthur Giron is an interpretation on how Feynman became one of the iconic American scientists and is loosely based on material found in Feynman s two transcribed oral memoirs Surely You re Joking  Mr  Feynman  and What Do You Care What Other People Think    On the twentieth anniversary of Feynman s death  composer Edward Manukyan dedicated a piece for solo clarinet to his memory  It was premiered by Doug Storey  the principal clarinetist of the Amarillo Symphony   Between 2009 and 2011  clips of an interview with Feynman were used by composer John Boswell as part of the Symphony of Science project in the second  fifth  seventh  and eleventh installments of his videos   We Are All Connected    The Poetry of Reality    A Wave of Reason   and  The Quantum World    In a 1992 New York Times article on Feynman and his legacy  James Gleick recounts the story of how Murray Gell Mann described what has become known as  The Feynman Algorithm  or  The Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm  to a student   The student asks Gell Mann about Feynman s notes  Gell Mann says no  Dick s methods are not the same as the methods used here  The student asks  well  what are Feynman s methods  Gell Mann leans coyly against the blackboard and says  Dick s method is this  You write down the problem  You think very hard   He shuts his eyes and presses his knuckles parodically to his forehead   Then you write down the answer    In 1998  a photograph of Richard Feynman giving a lecture was part of the poster series commissioned by Apple Inc  for their  Think Different  advertising campaign   In 2011  Feynman was the subject of a biographical graphic novel entitled simply Feynman  written by Jim Ottaviani and illustrated by Leland Myrick   In 2013  the BBC drama The Challenger depicted Feynman s role on the Rogers Commission in exposing the O ring flaw in NASA s solid rocket boosters  SRBs   itself based in part on Feynman s book What Do You Care What Other People Think   11  Bibliography  11 1  Selected
