The northern blot is a technique used in molecular biology research to study gene expression by detection of RNA  or isolated mRNA  in a sample  With northern blotting it is possible to observe cellular control over structure and function by determining the particular gene expression levels during differentiation  morphogenesis  as well as abnormal or diseased conditions  Northern blotting involves the use of electrophoresis to separate RNA samples by size and detection with a hybridization probe complementary to part of or the entire target sequence  The term  northern blot  actually refers specifically to the capillary transfer of RNA from the electrophoresis gel to the blotting membrane  However  the entire process is commonly referred to as northern blotting  The northern blot technique was developed in 1977 by James Alwine  David Kemp  and George Stark at Stanford University  Northern blotting takes its name from its similarity to the first blotting technique  the Southern blot  named for biologist Edwin Southern  The major difference is that RNA  rather than DNA  is analyzed in the northern blot   1  Procedure  A general blotting procedure starts with extraction of total RNA from a homogenized tissue sample or from cells  Eukaryotic mRNA can then be isolated through the use of oligo  dT  cellulose chromatography to isolate only those RNAs with a poly A  tail  RNA samples are then separated by gel electrophoresis  Since the gels are fragile and the probes are unable to enter the matrix  the RNA samples  now separated by size  are transferred to a nylon membrane through a capillary or vacuum blotting system  A nylon membrane with a positive charge is the most effective for use in northern blotting since the negatively charged nucleic acids have a high affinity for them  The transfer buffer used for the blotting usually contains formamide because it lowers the annealing temperature of the probe RNA interaction  thus eliminating the need for high temperatures  which could cause RNA degradation  Once the RNA has been transferred to the membrane  it is immobilized through covalent linkage to the membrane by UV light or heat  After a probe has been labeled  it is hybridized to the RNA on the membrane  Experimental conditions that can affect the efficiency and specificity of hybridization include ionic strength  viscosity  duplex length  mismatched base pairs  and base composition  The membrane is washed to ensure that the probe has bound specifically and to avoid background signals from arising  The hybrid signals are then detected by X ray film and can be quantified by densitometry  To create controls for comparison in a northern blot samples not displaying the gene product of interest can be used after determination by microarrays or RT PCR   1 1  Gels  The RNA samples are most commonly separated on agarose gels containing formaldehyde as a denaturing agent for the RNA to limit secondary structure  The gels can be stained with ethidium bromide  EtBr  and viewed under UV light to observe the quality and quantity of RNA before blotting  Polyacrylamide gel electrophoeresis with urea can also be used in RNA separation but it is most commonly used for fragmented RNA or microRNAs  An RNA ladder is often run alongside the samples on an electrophoresis gel to observe the size of fragments obtained but in total RNA samples the ribosomal subunits can act as size markers  Since the large ribosomal subunit is 28S  approximately 5kb  and the small ribosomal subunit is 18S  approximately 2kb  two prominent bands appear on the gel  the larger at close to twice the intensity of the smaller   1 2  Probes  Probes for northern blotting are composed of nucleic acids with a complementary sequence to all or part of the RNA of interest  they can be DNA  RNA  or oligonucleotides with a minimum of 25 complementary bases to the target sequence  RNA probes  riboprobes  that are transcribed in vitro are able to withstand more rigorous washing steps preventing some of the background noise  Commonly cDNA is created with labelled primers for the RNA sequence of interest to act as the probe in the northern blot  The probes must be labelled either with radioactive isotopes  32P  or with chemiluminescence in which alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase break down chemiluminescent substrates producing a detectable emission of light  The chemiluminescent labelling can occur in two ways  either the probe is attached to the enzyme  or the probe is labelled with a ligand  e g  biotin  for which the antibody  e g   avidin or streptavidin  is attached to the enzyme  X ray film can detect both the radioactive and chemiluminescent signals and many researchers prefer the chemiluminescent signals because they are faster  more sensitive  and reduce the health hazards that go along with radioactive labels  The same membrane can be probed up to five times without a significant loss of the target RNA   2  Applications  Northern blotting allows one to observe a particular gene s expression pattern between tissues  organs  developmental stages  environmental stress levels  pathogen infection  and over the course of treatment  The technique has been used to show overexpression of oncogenes and downregulation of tumor suppressor genes in cancerous cells when compared to  normal  tissue  as well as the gene expression in the rejection of transplanted organs  If an upregulated gene is observed by an abundance of mRNA on the northern blot the sample can then be sequenced to determine if the gene is known to researchers or if it is a novel finding  The expression patterns obtained under given conditions can provide insight into the function of that gene  Since the RNA is first separated by size  if only one probe type is used variance in the level of each band on the membrane can provide insight into the size of the product  suggesting alternative splice products of the same gene or repetitive sequence motifs  The variance in size of a gene product can also indicate deletions or errors in transcript processing  By altering the probe target used along the known sequence it is possible to determine which region of the RNA is missing   is an online database publishing northern blots  BlotBase has over 700 published northern blots of human and mouse samples  in over 650 genes across more than 25 different tissue types  Northern blots can be searched by a blot ID  paper reference  gene identifier  or by tissue  The results of a search provide the blot ID  species  tissue  gene  expression level  blot image  if available   and links to the publication that the work originated from  This new database provides sharing of information between members of the science community that was not previously seen in northern blotting as it was in sequence analysis  genome determination  protein structure  etc   3  Advantages and disadvantages  Analysis of gene expression can be done by several different methods including RT PCR  RNase protection assays  microarrays  serial analysis of gene expression  SAGE   as well as northern blotting  Microarrays are quite commonly used and are usually consistent with data obtained from northern blots  however  at times northern blotting is able to detect small changes in gene expression that microarrays cannot  The advantage that microarrays have over northern blots is that thousands of genes can be visualized at a time  while northern blotting is usually looking at one or a small number of genes   A problem in northern blotting is often sample degradation by RNases  both endogenous to the sample and through environmental contamination   which can be avoided by proper sterilization of glassware and the use of RNase inhibitors such as DEPC  diethylpyrocarbonate   The chemicals used in most northern blots can be a risk to the researcher  since formaldehyde  radioactive material  ethidium bromide  DEPC  and UV light are all harmful under certain exposures  Compared to RT PCR  northern blotting has a low sensitivity  but it also has a high specificity  which is important to reduce false positive results   The advantages of using northern blotting include the detection of RNA size  the observation of alternate splice products  the use of probes with partial homology  the quality and quantity of RNA can be measured on the gel prior to blotting  and the membranes can be stored and reprobed for years after blotting   4  Reverse northern blot  Researchers occasionally use a variant of the procedure known as the reverse northern blot  In this procedure  the substrate nucleic acid  that is affixed to the membrane  is a collection of isolated DNA fragments  and the probe is RNA extracted from a tissue and radioactively labelled   The use of DNA microarrays that have come into widespread use in the late 1990s and early 2000s is more akin to the reverse procedure  in that they involve the use of isolated DNA fragments affixed to a substrate  and hybridization with a probe made from cellular RNA  Thus the reverse procedure  though originally uncommon  enabled northern analysis to evolve into gene expression profiling  in which many  possibly all  of the genes in an organism may have their expression monitored   5  See also  Southern blot  Western blot  Northwestern blot  Far
