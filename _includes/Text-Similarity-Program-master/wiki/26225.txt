Rædwald     power in counsel    also rendered as Raedwald or Redwald  was a 7th century king of East Anglia  a long lived Anglo Saxon kingdom which today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk  He was the son of Tytila of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty  named after his grandfather  Wuffa   who were the first kings of the East Angles  Details about Rædwald s reign are scarce  primarily because the Viking invasions of the 9th century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept  Rædwald reigned from about 599 until his death around 624  initially under the overlordship of Æthelberht of Kent  In 616  as a result of fighting the Battle of the River Idle and defeating Æthelfrith of Northumbria  he was able to install Edwin  who was acquiescent to his authority  as the new king of Northumbria  During the battle  both Æthelfrith and Rædwald s son Rægenhere were killed   From around 616  Rædwald was the most powerful of the English kings south of the River Humber  According to Bede he was the fourth ruler to hold imperium over other southern Anglo Saxon kingdoms  he was referred to in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle  written centuries after his death  as a bretwalda  an Old English term meaning  Britain ruler  or  wide ruler    He was the first king of the East Angles to become a Christian  converting at Æthelberht s court some time before 605  whilst at the same time maintaining a pagan temple  In receiving the faith he helped to ensure the survival of Christianity in East Anglia during the apostasy of the Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Kent  He is generally considered by historians to be the most favoured candidate for the occupant of the Sutton Hoo ship burial  although other theories have been advanced   1  Sources  The kingdom of East Anglia    was a small independent Anglo Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire Fens  Few sources have survived that were written by the Anglo Saxons in England  and East Anglia has even less documentary evidence than most of the kingdoms existing at that time  The historian Barbara Yorke has suggested that the reason for the paucity of East Anglian sources was almost certainly the Viking expansion in the 9th century as the monks and scribes of East Anglia produced as much work as those living in other parts of England  The devastation caused by the Vikings is thought to have destroyed all the books and charters that may have been kept there   Rædwald is the first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known  though no details of his life before his accession are known  The earliest and most substantial source for Rædwald is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum  Ecclesiastical History of the English People   completed in 731 by Bede  a Northumbrian monk  Bede placed Rædwald s reign between the advent of the Gregorian mission to Kent in 597 and the marriage and conversion of Edwin of Northumbria during 625–26   Later medieval chroniclers  such as Roger of Wendover  gave some information about East Anglian events  but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded  Such later sources are therefore treated with caution  The Anglian collection  which dates from the late 8th century  contains an East Anglian genealogical tally  but Rædwald is not included  Rædwald is however referred to in the 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great  written by a member of the religious community at Whitby  The Battle of the River Idle  in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians  is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum  written by Henry of Huntingdon   2  The context of Rædwald s kingdom  The Anglo Saxons  who are known to have included Angles  Saxons  Jutes and Frisians  began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century  By 600  a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories  By the beginning of the 7th century  southern England was almost entirely under their control   During Rædwald s youth  the establishment of other ruling houses was accomplished  Sometime before 588  Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta  the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert  As early as 568  Ceawlin of Wessex  the most powerful ruler south of the River Humber  repulsed Æthelberht  According to later sources  Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585  although a paucity of sources makes it difficult to know how the Mercian royal line became established   North of the Humber  the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia possessed rival royal dynasties  Ælla ruled Deira until his death in 588  leaving his daughter Acha  his son Edwin  and another unknown sibling  The Bernician dynasty  allied by kinship to the kingdom of Wessex  gained ascendancy over Deira  forcing Edwin to live in exile in the court of Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd  In various wars  Æthelfrith of Bernicia consolidated the Northumbrian state  and in around 604 he was able to bring Deira under his dominion   3  Family  Rædwald  which in Old English means  power in counsel   was born around 560–580  The son of Tytila  whom he succeeded  he was the elder brother of Eni  According to Bede  he was descended from Wuffa  the founder of the Wuffingas dynasty    filius Tytili  cuius pater fuit UUffa   the son of Tytil  whose father was Wuffa     At some time during the 590s  Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown  though it is known from Bede that she was pagan  By her he fathered at least two sons  Rægenhere and Eorpwald  He also had an older son  Sigeberht  whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which is typical of the East Saxon dynasty  It has been suggested that Rædwald s queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald s stepson  as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century  Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step father  who drove him into exile in Gaul  possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline   4  Early reign and baptism  Events that occurred during the early years of Rædwald s reign include the arrival of Augustine of Canterbury and his mission from Rome in 597  the conversions of Æthelberht of Kent and Saeberht of Essex  and the establishment of new bishoprics in their kingdoms  Bede  when relating the conversion of Rædwald s son Eorpwald in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum  mentioned that Rædwald received the Christian sacraments in Kent  This happened in perhaps 604 or later  presumably at the invitation of Æthelberht  who may have been his baptismal sponsor  The date of his conversion is unknown  but it would have occurred after the arrival of the Gregorian mission in 597  Since it is claimed that Saint Augustine  who died in about 605  dedicated a church near Ely  it may have followed Saebert s conversion fairly swiftly  Rædwald s marriage to a member of the royal dynasty of Essex helped form a diplomatic alliance between the neighbouring kingdoms of East Anglia and Essex  His conversion in Kent would have affiliated him with Æthelberht  bringing him directly into the sphere of Kent   In East Anglia  Rædwald s conversion was not universally accepted by his household or his own queen  According to the historian Steven Plunkett  she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to the Christian faith  As a result  he kept in the temple two altars  one pagan and another dedicated to Christ  Bede  writing decades later  described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia  a grandson of Rædwald s brother Eni  recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy  It was located at Rendlesham  the regio of the Wuffing dynasty  according to Plunkett  Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity  as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht  Rædwald s lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede  who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith   5  Rædwald and Edwin of Northumbria  5 1  Edwin s exile  Æthelfrith of Northumbria may have married Acha  who was the mother of his son Oswald  born in about 604   according to Bede  Æthelfrith pursued her exiled brother Edwin in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged  Edwin found hospitality in the household of Cearl of Mercia and later married Cearl s daughter  Edwin s nephew Hereric  an exile in the British kingdom of Elmet  was slain there under treacherous circumstances  Edwin eventually sought the protection of Rædwald  where he was received willingly  Rædwald promised to protect him  and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions  When news of Edwin reached Æthelfrith in Northumbria  he sent messengers to Rædwald offering money in return for Edwin s death  but Rædwald refused to comply  Æthelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time  offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted  Rædwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to hand him over to ambassadors   When a chance arose for him to escape to a safe country  Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald s court  He was then visited by a stranger who was aware of Rædwald s deliberations  The source for this story  written at Whitby  stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York  a member of the Canterbury mission  who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald s support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king  Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching  His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity  on the condition that he survived and achieved power  If  as is supposed by some  Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh  the bishop s presence at Rædwald s court would throw some light on the king s position regarding religion   Rædwald s pagan queen admonished him for acting in a manner dishonourable for a king by betraying his trust for the sake of money and wanting to sell his imperiled friend in exchange for riches  As a result of her admonishment  once Æthelfrith s ambassadors had gone  Rædwald resolved on war   5 2  The Battle of the River Idle  In 616 or 617  Rædwald assembled an army and marched north  accompanied by his son Rægenhere  to confront Æthelfrith  They met on the western boundary of the kingdom of Lindsey  on the east bank of the River Idle  The battle was fierce and was long commemorated in the saying  ‘The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen’  During the fighting  Æthelfrith and Rædwald s son Rægenhere were both slain  Edwin then succeeded Æthelfrith as the king of Northumbria  and Æthelfrith s sons were subsequently forced into exile   A separate account of the battle  given by Henry of Huntingdon  stated that Rædwald s army was split into three formations  led by Rædwald  Rægenhere  and Edwin  With more experienced fighters  Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation  At the sight of Rægenhere  perhaps thinking he was Edwin  Æthelfrith s men cut their way through to him and slew him  After the death of his son  Rædwald furiously breached his lines  killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians   D P  Kirby has argued that the battle was more than a clash between two kings over the treatment of an exiled nobleman but was  part of a protracted struggle to determine the military and political leadership of the Anglian peoples  at that time   6  Rædwald s imperium  On 24 February 616  the year of the Battle of the River Idle  Æthelberht of Kent died and was succeeded by his pagan son Eadbald  After the death of the Christian Saebert of Essex  his three sons shared the kingdom  returning it to pagan rule  and drove out the Gregorian missionaries led by Mellitus  The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back into the fold  During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to Rædwald  By the time of his death  the mission in Kent had been fully re established   Rædwald s power became great enough for Bede to recognise him as the successor to the imperium of Æthelberht  Bede also called him Rex Anglorum  the  King of the Angles   a term that Rædwald s contemporaries would have used for their overlord  It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his authority over the Angles of eastern England   By Edwin s debt of allegiance to him  Rædwald became the first foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria  He would have been instrumental in Edwin s secure establishment as king of both Diera and Bernicia   7  The development of Gipeswic  During the first quarter of the 7th century  the quayside settlement at Gipeswic  Ipswich  became an important estuarine trading centre  receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea  Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision  It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town  but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy   The excavated grave goods of the Anglo Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic  including those found in burials under small barrows  were not particularly wealthy or elaborate  They lacked the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river  One exception was a furnished grave that it has been suggested could have been that of a visitor from the Rhineland   8  Death  Rædwald is considered to have died in around 624  his death can be located only within a few years  He must have reigned for some time after Æthelberht died  in order for him to have been noted as a bretwalda  Barbara Yorke suggests that he died before Edwin converted to Christianity in 627 and also before Paulinus became bishop of Northumbria in 625  His death is recorded twice by Roger of Wendover  in 599 and in 624  in a history that dates from the 13th century but appears to include earlier annals of unknown origin and reliability  Plunkett notes that the earlier date of 599 is now taken as a mistaken reference to the death of Rædwald’s father  Tytila  and the later date is commonly given for the death of Rædwald   He was succeeded by his pagan son Eorpwald  who was later persuaded to adopt Christianity by Edwin of Northumbria   8 1  Sutton Hoo  Rædwald lived at a time when eminent individuals were buried in barrows at the cemetery at Sutton Hoo  near Woodbridge  Suffolk  There  large mounds—which were originally much higher and more visible—can still be seen  overlooking the upper estuary of the River Deben   In 1939  a mound at Sutton Hoo  now known as Mound 1  was discovered to contain an Anglo Saxon ship burial of unparalleled richness  The mound enclosed a ship  long  which had seen use on the seas and had been repaired  In the centre of the ship was a chamber containing a collection of jewellery and other rich grave goods  including silver bowls  drinking vessels  clothing and weaponry  One unusual item was a large  sceptre  in the form of a whetstone that showed no sign of previous use as a tool  it has been suggested that this was a symbol of the office of bretwalda  The gold and garnet body equipment found with the other goods was produced for a patron who employed a goldsmith the equal or better than any in Europe and was designed to project an image of imperial power  The Mediterranean silverware in the grave is a unique assemblage for its period in Europe   The magnificence of the objects  both the personal possessions and those items designed to denote the authority of the dead individual  point to the death of a person connected with the royal court  according to Rupert Bruce Mitford  who regards the burial as  very likely the monument of the High King or bretwalda Raedwald   Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to Rædwald by subject kings during his period as bretwalda  Bruce Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls and spoons amongst the treasures fits with Bede s account of Raedwald s conversion  the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance  Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of Rædwald s death  The controversy surrounding the identity of the person for whom the mound was built are reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography   It has been argued  more strongly than convincingly  that Rædwald must be the man buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo   and by McClure and Collins  who note that the evidence for Raedwald is  almost non existent    Alternative suggestions as candidates include other East Anglian kings or a prestigious foreign visitor  There are alternative explanations  the person may have been a wealthy status seeker  rather than a king  though Rendlesham  a known residence of the East Anglian kings  is only away   Swedish cultural influence has been detected at Sutton Hoo  there are strong similarities in both the armour and the burial with Vendel age finds from Sweden  Bruce Mitford suggested that the connection is close enough to imply that the Wuffing dynasty came from that part of Scandinavia  There are also significant differences  and exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts cannot be found elsewhere  as a result the connection is generally regarded as unproven   It is also possible that the mound is actually a cenotaph rather than a grave  the only sign of body was a chemical stain which could have had other origins  indeed the site includes burials of both meat and companion animals  Further there is a lack of shroud ties  and no clear evidence of items which might have adorned a body being left in the expected places in relation to the stain  The cenotaph theory may be consistent with the transition from pagan burial to Christian burial  certainly as far as Rædwald is concerned  he could have received a Christian burial  and the mound  whether completed before or after his conversion being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia   9  See
