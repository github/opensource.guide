in Latin and is the recognized English language name for the province  In French it is called  Nouvelle Écosse   which is a literal translation from Latin to French  In Scottish Gaelic  the province is called Alba Nuadh  which also simply means New Scotland  The province was first named in the 1621 Royal Charter granting the right to settle lands including modern Nova Scotia  Cape Breton Island  Prince Edward Island  New Brunswick  and the Gaspé peninsula to Sir William Alexander in 1632   2  Geography  Nova Scotia is Canada s second smallest province in area after Prince Edward Island  The

coast   2 1  Climate  Nova Scotia lies in the mid temperate zone and  although the province is almost surrounded by water  the climate is closer to continental than to maritime  The temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean   Described on the provincial vehicle licence plate as Canada s Ocean Playground  Nova Scotia has a climate that is primarily influenced by the sea  Nova Scotia s cold winters and warm summers are modified and generally moderated by ocean influences  The province is surrounded by four major bodies of water  the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the north  the Bay of Fundy to the west  the Gulf of Maine to the southwest  and Atlantic Ocean to the east   3  History  3 1  Overview  The province includes regions of the Mi kmaq nation of Mi kma ki  mi gama gi   Nova Scotia was already home to the Mi kmaq people when the first European colonists arrived  In 1605  French colonists established the first permanent European settlement in Canada and the first north of Florida at Port Royal  founding what would become known as Acadia   The British conquest of Acadia took place in 1710  It was formally recognized in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht  Cape Breton Island  Île Royale  was returned to the French in the Treaty of Utrecht  What is now New Brunswick was still a part of the French colony of Acadia  The name of the capital was changed from Port Royal to Annapolis Royal  Nova Scotia  In 1749  the capital of Nova Scotia was changed from Annapolis Royal to the newly established Halifax  In 1755  the vast majority of the French population  the Acadians  were expelled and replaced by New England Planters who arrived between 1759 and 1768   In 1763  most of Acadia  Cape Breton Island  St  John s Island  now Prince Edward Island   and New Brunswick  became part of Nova Scotia  In 1769  St  John s Island became a separate colony  Nova Scotia included present day New Brunswick until that province was established in 1784  after the arrival of United Empire Loyalists  In 1867  Nova Scotia was one of the four founding provinces of the Canadian Confederation   3 2  17th and 18th centuries  The history of Nova Scotia was significantly influenced by the warfare that took place on its soil during the 17th and 18th centuries  The Mi’kmaq had lived in Nova Scotia for centuries  The French arrived in 1604  and Catholic Mi’kmaq and Acadians were the predominant populations in the colony for the next 150 years  During the first 80 years the French and Acadians were in Nova Scotia  there were nine significant battles as the English and Scottish  later British   Dutch and French fought for possession of the colony  These battles happened at Port Royal  Saint John  Cap de Sable  present day Port La Tour  Nova Scotia   Jemseg and Baleine  During the 17th Century there was the Acadian Civil War  1640–45    Beginning with King William s War in 1688  there were six wars in Nova Scotia before the French were defeated and peace was made with the Acadians and Mi’kmaq   King William s War  1688–1697    Queen Anne s War  1702–1713    Father Rale s War  1722–1725    King George s War  1744–1748    Father Le Loutre’s War  1749–1755   French and Indian War  1754–1763  The battles during these wars were primarily fought at Port Royal  Saint John  Canso  Chignecto  Dartmouth  Lunenburg and Grand Pré  Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710  Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi kmaq  who confined British forces to Annapolis and Canso  A generation later  Father Le Loutre s War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21  1749  A General Court  made up of the governor and the Council  was the highest court in the colony at the time  Jonathan Belcher was sworn in as chief justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on 21 October 1754  The first legislative assembly in Halifax  under the Governorship of Edward Cornwallis  met on 2 October 1758  During the French and Indian War  North American theatre of the Seven Years  War   the British deported the Acadians and recruited New England Planters to resettle the colony  The seventy five year period of war ended with the Burial of the Hatchet Ceremony between the British and the Mi kmaq  1761   After the war  some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi’kmaq   The American Revolution  1775–1783  had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia  At the beginning  there was ambivalence in Nova Scotia   the 14th American Colony  as some called it  over whether the colony should join the Americans in the war against Britain and rebellion flared at the Battle of Fort Cumberland and the Siege of Saint John  1777   Throughout the war  American privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax  These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British  By the end of the war a number of Nova Scotian privateers were outfitted to attack American shipping  British military forces based at Halifax were successful in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia  However the British navy was unable to establish naval supremacy  While many American privateers were captured in battles such as the Naval battle off Halifax  many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war  The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines  defending convoys from American and French attacks such as the fiercely fought convoy battle  the Naval battle off Cape Breton   After the British were defeated in the Thirteen Colonies  its troops helped evacuate approximately 30 000 United Empire Loyalists  American Tories   who settled in Nova Scotia  with land grants by the Crown as some compensation for their losses   Nova Scotia was divided and the present day province of New Brunswick created   The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia  including Shelburne  which was briefly one of the larger British settlements in North America  and infused the province with additional capital and skills  However the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing New England Planters settlement  The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia s Mi kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill defined native lands  Approximately 3 000 members of the Loyalist migration were Black Loyalists who founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at Birchtown  near Shelburne  However unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused about one third of the Black Loyalists to resettle in Sierra Leone in 1792 where they founded Freetown and became known in Africa as the Nova Scotian Settlers   3 3  19th century  During the War of 1812  Nova Scotia’s contribution to the war effort was communities either purchasing or building various privateer ships to lay siege to American vessels  Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the war for Nova Scotia was when HMS Shannon escorted the captured American frigate USS Chesapeake into Halifax Harbour  1813   Many of the prisoners were kept at Deadman s Island  Halifax   During this century  Nova Scotia was the first colony in British North America and in the British Empire to achieve responsible government in January–February 1848 and become self governing through the efforts of Joseph Howe  Nova Scotia had established representative government in 1758  an achievement that was later commemorated by erecting the Dingle Tower in 1908   Nova Scotians fought in the Crimean War  The Welsford Parker Monument in Halifax is the second oldest war monument in Canada  1860  and the only Crimean War monument in North America  It commemorates the Siege of Sevastopol  1854–1855    Thousands of Nova Scotians fought in the American Civil War  1861–1865   primarily for the North  The British Empire  including Nova Scotia  was declared neutral in the struggle between the North and the South  As a result  Britain  and Nova Scotia  continued to trade with both the South and the North  Nova Scotia’s economy boomed during the Civil War   Immediately after the Civil War  Pro Confederation premier Charles Tupper led Nova Scotia into the Canadian Confederation on July 1  1867  along with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada  The Anti Confederation Party was led by Joseph Howe  Almost three months later  in the election of September 18  1867  the Anti Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats  and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature   Nova Scotia became a world leader in both building and owning wooden sailing ships in the second half of the 19th century  Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders Donald McKay and William Dawson Lawrence  The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when Joshua Slocum became the first man to sail single handedly around the world  1895   This international attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the Bluenose schooner  Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of Samuel Cunard  a British shipping magnate  born at Halifax  Nova Scotia  who founded the Cunard Line   Throughout the nineteenth century  there were numerous businesses that were developed in Nova Scotia that became of national and international importance  The Starr Manufacturing Company  first skate manufacturer in Canada   the Bank of Nova Scotia  Cunard Line  Alexander Keith s Brewery  Morse s Tea Company  first tea company in Canada   among others

s richest province  Alberta  GDP growth has lagged behind the rest of the country for at least the past decade   Nova Scotia s traditionally resource based economy has diversified in recent decades  The rise of Nova Scotia as a viable jurisdiction in North America  historically  was driven by the ready availability of natural resources  especially the fish stocks off the Scotian Shelf  The fishery was pillar of the economy since its development as part of the economy of New France in the 17th century  however  the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century  The collapse of the cod stocks and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20 000 jobs in 1992  Other sectors in the province were also hit hard  particularly during the last two decades  coal mining in Cape Breton and northern mainland Nova Scotia has virtually ceased production  and a large steel mill in Sydney closed during the 1990s  More recently  the high value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U S  dollar has hurt the forestry industry  leading to the shut down of a long running pulp and paper mill near Liverpool  Mining  especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica  peat and barite  is also a significant sector  Since 1991  offshore oil and gas has become an increasingly important part of the economy  although production and revenue are now declining  Agriculture remains an important sector in the province  particularly in the Annapolis Valley   Nova Scotia’s defence and aerospace sector generates approximately $500 million in revenues and contributes about $1 5 billion to the provincial economy annually  To date  40% of Canada’s military assets reside in Nova Scotia  Nova Scotia has the fourth largest film

the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council  a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral  elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Nova Scotia  presently Stephen McNeil   the head of government  To ensure the stability of government  the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly  The leader of the party with the second most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty s Loyal Opposition
