Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the Midwestern United States  The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa  meaning  large water  or  large lake   Michigan is the ninth most populous of the 50 United States  with the 11th most extensive total area  the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River   Its capital is Lansing  and the largest city is Detroit   Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas  The Lower Peninsula  to which the name Michigan was originally applied  is often noted to be shaped like a mitten  The Upper Peninsula  often referred to as  the U P    is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac  a channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan  The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge  The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world  being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes  plus Lake Saint Clair  As a result  it is one of the leading U S  states for recreational boating  Michigan also has 64 980 inland lakes and ponds  and a person in the state is never more than from a natural water source or more than from a Great Lakes shoreline   What is now Michigan was first settled by various Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France  After the defeat of France in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British rule  and was finally ceded to the newly independent United States after the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War  The area was organized as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800  when western Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory  Eventually  in 1805  the Michigan Territory was formed  which lasted until it was admitted into the Union on January 26  1837  as the 26th state  The state of Michigan soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination   Though Michigan has come to develop a diverse economy  it is widely known as the center of the U S  automotive industry  being home to the country s three major automobile companies  whose headquarters are all located within the Detroit metropolitan area   While sparsely populated  the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural resources  while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing  services  and high tech industry   1  History  When the first European explorers arrived  the most populous tribes were Algonquian peoples  which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe  called  Chippewa  in French   Odaawaa Odawa  Ottawa   and the Boodewaadamii Bodéwadmi  Potawatomi   The three nations co existed peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three Fires  The Ojibwe  whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25 000 and 35 000  were the largest   The Ojibwe were established in Michigan s Upper Peninsula and northern and central Michigan  and also inhabited Ontario  northern Wisconsin  southern Manitoba  and northern and north central Minnesota  The Ottawa lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern  western and southern Michigan  but also in southern Ontario  northern Ohio and eastern Wisconsin  while the Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan  in addition to northern and central Indiana  northern Illinois  southern Wisconsin and southern Ontario  Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan  in the south and east  were the Mascouten  the Menominee  the Miami  the Sac  or Sauk   and the Fox  and the non Algonquian Wyandot  who are better known by their French name  the Huron   1 1  17th century  French voyageurs and coureurs des bois explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century  The first Europeans to reach what later became Michigan were those of Étienne Brûlé s expedition in 1622  The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste  Marie  Michigan as a base for Catholic missions  Missionaries in 1671–75 founded outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette  Jesuit missionaries were well received by the Indian populations in the area  with relatively few difficulties or hostilities  In 1679  Robert Cavelier  Sieur de la Salle built Fort Miami at present day St  Joseph   1 2  18th century  In 1701  French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit or  Fort Pontchartrain on the Strait  on the strait  known as the Detroit River  between lakes Saint Clair and Erie  Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV s chief minister  Louis Phélypeaux  Comte de Pontchartrain  that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspirations   The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent  about   the equivalent of just under per side  and named it Fort Pontchartrain  Cadillac s wife  Marie Thérèse Guyon  soon moved to Detroit  becoming one of the first European women to settle in the Michigan wilderness  The town quickly became a major fur trading and shipping post  The Église de Saint Anne  Church of Saint Ann  was founded the same year  While the original building does not survive  the congregation of that name continues to be active today  Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716  French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the Fox Wars involving the Meskwaki  Fox  and their allies versus the French and their Native allies   At the same time  the French strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur trading empire  By the mid 18th century  the French also occupied forts at present day Niles and Sault Ste  Marie  though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans  France offered free land in an effort to attract families to Detroit  which grew to 800 people in 1765  the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans   From 1660 to the end of French rule  Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France  In 1760  Montreal fell to the British forces ending the French and Indian War  1754–1763   Under the 1763 Treaty of Paris  Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River passed to Great Britain  After the Quebec Act was passed in 1774  Michigan became part of the British Province of Quebec  By 1778  Detroit s population was up to 2 144 and it was the third largest city in Quebec   During the American Revolutionary War  Detroit was an important British supply center  Most of the inhabitants were French Canadians or Native Americans  many of whom had been allied with the French  Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris  the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution  When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791  Michigan was part of Kent County  Upper Canada  It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark  now Niagara on the Lake    Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty  Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796  Questions remained over the boundary for many years  and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847  respectively   1 3  19th century  During the War of 1812  Michigan Territory  effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area  was surrendered after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812  An attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre  This battle is still the bloodiest ever fought in the state and had the highest number of American casualties of any battle in the war  Ultimately  Michigan was recaptured by Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie  An invasion of Canada which culminated in the Battle of the Thames was then launched from Michigan  The more northern areas were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries  A number of forts  including Fort Wayne were built in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain  The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal connecting the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and New York City  The new route brought a large influx of settlers  who became farmers and merchants and shipped out grain  lumber  and iron ore  By the 1830s  Michigan had 80 000 residents  more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood  In October 1835 the people approved the Constitution of 1835  thereby forming a state government  although Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War  Congress awarded the  Toledo Strip  to Ohio  Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union on January 26  1837  The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber  iron  and copper  Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s  Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward  with Detroit the chief hub   The first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took place July 6  1854  in Jackson  Michigan  where the party adopted its platform  The state was heavily Republican until the 1930s  Michigan made a significant contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies   Modernizers and boosters set up systems for public education  including founding the University of Michigan  1817  moved to Ann Arbor in 1837   for a classical academic education  and Michigan State Normal School   1849  now Eastern Michigan University  for the training of teachers  In 1899  it became the first normal college in the nation to offer a four year curriculum  Michigan Agricultural College  1855   now Michigan State University in East Lansing  was founded as the pioneer land grant college  a model for those authorized under the Morrill Act  1862   Many other private colleges were founded as well  and the smaller cities formed high schools late in the century   1 4  20th and 21st centuries  Michigan s economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century  Many individuals  including Ransom E  Olds  John and Horace Dodge  Henry Leland  David Dunbar Buick  Henry Joy  Charles King  and Henry Ford  provided the concentration of engineering know how and technological enthusiasm to start the birth of the automotive industry  Ford s development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked the beginning of a new era in transportation  Like the steamship and railroad  it was a far reaching development  More than the forms of public transportation  the automobile transformed private life  It became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan  and permanently altered the socio economic life of the United States and much of the world   With the growth  the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the U S   including those from the South  By 1920  Detroit was the fourth largest city in the U S  Residential housing was in short supply  and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom  By the 1930s  so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools  and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals  Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit s diverse urban culture  including popular music trends  such as the influential Motown Sound of the 1960s led by a variety of individual singers and groups  Grand Rapids  the second largest city in Michigan  is also an important center of manufacturing  Since 1838  the city has also been noted for its furniture industry and is home to five of the world s leading office furniture companies  Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including Steelcase  Amway  and Meijer  Grand Rapids is also an important center for GE Aviation Systems   Michigan held its first United States presidential primary election in 1910  With its rapid growth in industry  it was an important center of union industry wide organizing  such as the rise of the United Auto Workers   In 1920 WWJ  AM  in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs  Throughout that decade  some of the country s largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city  Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building  Cadillac Place  and the Guardian Building  each of which is a National Historic Landmark  NHL    In 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton County  the Bath School disaster  which resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren  constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U S  history   Michigan manufactured 10 9 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II  ranking second  behind New York  among the 48 states   Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s  at one point doubling its population in a decade  After World War II  housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores  newly constructed U S  Interstate Highways allowed commuters to navigate the region more easily  Modern advances in the auto industry have resulted in increased automation  high tech industry  and increased suburban growth since 1960   Michigan is the leading auto producing state in the U S   with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States  Ontario  Canada  and the Southern United States  With almost ten million residents  Michigan is a large and influential state  ranking eighth in population among the fifty states  Detroit is the centrally located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the second largest metropolitan area in the U S  linking the Great Lakes system  The Metro Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the largest metropolitan area in the state  roughly 50% of the population resides there  and the eleventh largest in the USA  The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan is the fastest growing metro area in the state  with over 1 3 million residents as of 2006  Metro Detroit receives more than 15 million visitors each year  Michigan has many popular tourist destinations which include areas such as Traverse City on the Grand Traverse Bay in Northern Michigan  Tourists spend about $17 billion annually in Michigan supporting 193 000 jobs   Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in overall Research & development  R&D  expenditures in the U S  The state s leading research institutions include the University of Michigan  Michigan State University and Wayne State University which are important partners in the state s economy and the state s University Research Corridor  Michigan s public universities attract more than $1 5 B in research and development grants each year  Agriculture also serves a significant role making the state a leading grower of fruit in the U S   including blueberries  cherries  apples  grapes and peaches   2  Government  2 1  State government  Michigan is governed as a republic  with three branches of government  the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional officers  the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate  and the judicial branch  The Michigan Constitution allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory initiative and referendum  recall  and constitutional initiative and referral  Article II  § 9  defined as  the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws  called the initiative  and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature  called the referendum  The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution    Lansing is the state capital and is home to all three branches of state government   The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four year terms and may be re elected only once  The current governor is Rick Snyder  Michigan has two official Governor s Residences  one is in Lansing  and the other is at Mackinac Island  The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor  who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor  the secretary of state  and the attorney general  The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate  but only voting when ties occur  and is also a member of the cabinet  The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles  all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state   The Michigan Legislature consists of a 38 member Senate and 110 member House of Representatives  Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through first past the post elections by single member electoral districts of near equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines  Senators serve four year terms concurrent to those of the governor  while representatives serve two year terms  The Michigan State Capitol was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since   The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction  the Circuit Courts and the District Courts   one intermediate level appellate court  the Michigan Court of Appeals   and the Michigan Supreme Court  There are several administrative courts and specialized courts  District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction  handling most traffic violations  small claims  misdemeanors  and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25 000  District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases  District court judges are elected to terms of six years  In a few locations  municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts  There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan  which have original jurisdiction over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25 000 and all criminal cases involving felonies  Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue equitable remedies  Circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction from district and municipal courts  as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies  Most counties have their own circuit court  but sparsely populated counties often share them  Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years  State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years  but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor  There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals  being located in Detroit  Grand Rapids  Lansing  and Marquette  Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges  who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case  unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact  The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non partisan ballots for staggered eight year terms  The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances  but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system   2 2  Law  Michigan has had four constitutions  the first of which was ratified on October 5 and 6  1835  There were also constitutions from 1850 and 1908  in addition to the current constitution from 1963  The current document has a preamble  11 articles  and one section consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions  Michigan  like every US state except Louisiana  has a common law legal system   2 3  Politics  Voters in the state elect candidates from both major parties  Economic issues are important in Michigan elections   The three term Republican Governor John Engler  1991–2003  preceded the former two term Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm  2003–2011   The state has elected successive Republican attorneys general twice since 2003  The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both the House and Senate of the Michigan Legislature  Michigan supported the election of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H W  Bush  The current Governor Rick Snyder  2011–present  is a Republican   However  the state has supported Democrats in the last six presidential election cycles  In 2012  Barack Obama carried the state over Mitt Romney  winning Michigan s 17 electoral votes with 54% of the vote  Michigan s two U S  Senators are both Democrats  while Republicans hold nine of the state s fourteen U S  House seats  In 2000  the current Democratic U S  Senator Debbie Stabenow won narrowly over Republican U S  Senator Spencer Abraham  Michigan s senior U S  Senator Carl Levin  a Democrat  has been elected to six terms since 1979  after he defeated the Republican U S  Senator Robert P  Griffin  Carl Levin serves as Chairman of the U S  Senate Committee on Armed Services  Congressman Fred Upton  a Republican  serves as Chairman of the U S  House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Congressman Mike Rogers  also a Republican  serves as Chairman of U S  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  John Dingell  a Democrat  is the Dean of the United States House of Representatives   Republican strongholds of the state include rural areas of western  northern  central  and the Grand Rapids metro area   Suburban Detroit  which includes Oakland  Macomb  Livingston  and a large portion of Wayne County has a mixed voting history   Democratic strongholds include Wayne County  which includes the city of Detroit  Washtenaw County  Ann Arbor   Ingham County  Lansing   and Genesee County  Flint    Historically  the first county level meeting of the Republican Party took place in Jackson on July 6  1854  and the party thereafter dominated Michigan until the Great Depression  In the 1912 election  Michigan was one of the six states to support progressive Republican and third party candidate Theodore Roosevelt for president after he lost the Republican nomination to William Howard Taft   Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century  It was part of Greater New England  the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from New England who carried their culture with them  The state was one of only a handful to back Wendell Willkie over Franklin Roosevelt in 1940  and supported Thomas E  Dewey in his losing bid against Harry S  Truman in 1948  Michigan went to the Democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s  and voted for Republican Richard Nixon in 1972   Michigan was the home of Gerald Ford  the 38th President of the United States  He was born in Nebraska and moved as an infant to Grand Rapids and grew up there  The Gerald R  Ford Museum is located in Grand Rapids  and the Gerald R  Ford Presidential Library is located on the campus of his alma mater  the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor   In 1846 Michigan became the first state in the Union  as well as the first English speaking government in the world  to abolish the death penalty  Historian David Chardavoyne has suggested that the movement to abolish capital punishment in Michigan grew as a result of enmity toward the state s neighbor  Canada  Under British rule  it made public executions a regular practice   Michigan does not recognize or perform same sex marriages or other unions involving same sex couples under a 2004 state constitutional amendment  however  the legality of same sex marriage in the state of Michigan is under debate following a May 21  2014  ruling in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan making the 2004 state amendment invalid and rendering gay marriage legal  An appeal by state Attorney General Bill Schuette to the Sixth Circuit Court and the subsequent federal appeals court s issuance of an indefinite stay on the ruling leaves same sex marriage in a state of limbo  being legal but unrecognized by the state  until a ruling from the Sixth Circuit Court can be issued   Michigan has approved plans to expand Medicaid coverage in 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level  approximately $15 500 for a single adult in 2014    2 4  Administrative divisions  State government is decentralized among three tiers – statewide  county and township  Counties are administrative divisions of the state  and townships are administrative divisions of a county  Both of them exercise state government authority  localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions  as provided by state law  There are 83 counties in Michigan   Cities  state universities  and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees  Home rule cities can generally do anything that is not prohibited by law  The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution  Villages  by contrast  have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located   There are two types of township in Michigan  general law township and charter  Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city  As of April 2001  there were 127 charter townships in Michigan  In general  charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations  For example  a charter township can have its own fire department  water and sewer department  police department  and so on—just like a city—but it is not required to have those things  whereas cities must provide those services  Charter townships can opt to use county wide services instead  such as deputies from the county sheriff s office instead of a home based force of ordinance officers   3  Geography  Michigan consists of two peninsulas that lie between 82°30  to about 90°30  west longitude  and are separated by the Straits of Mackinac  The 45th parallel north runs through the state—marked by highway signs and the Polar Equator Trail—along a line including Mission Point Light near Traverse City  the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula  With the exception of two small areas that are drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula  Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes St  Lawrence watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained  The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie  Lake Huron  Lake Michigan and Lake Superior  It has more lighthouses than any other state  The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana  sharing land and water boundaries with both  Michigan s western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries  from south to north  with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan  then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula  that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers  then water boundaries again  in Lake Superior  with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west  capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east   The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west  The Porcupine Mountains  which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world  rise to an altitude of almost 2 000 feet  610 m  above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan  The surface on either side of this range is rugged  The state s highest point  in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette  is Mount Arvon at   The peninsula is as large as Connecticut  Delaware  Massachusetts  and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330 000 inhabitants  They are sometimes called  Yoopers   from  U P  ers    and their speech  the  Yooper dialect   has been heavily influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century   The Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from  It is long from north to south and from east to west and occupies nearly two thirds of the state s land area  The surface of the peninsula is generally level  broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall  It is divided by a low water divide running north and south  The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan  The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at   or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac  The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at    The geographic orientation of Michigan s peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state  Ironwood  in the far western Upper Peninsula  lies 630 highway miles  1 015 km  from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula s southeastern corner  The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan s political and population centers makes the U P  culturally and economically distinct  Occasionally U P  residents have called for secession from Michigan and establishment as a new state to be called  Superior    A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb  This peninsula projects out into Lake Huron and the Saginaw Bay  The geography of the Thumb is mainly flat with a few rolling hills  Other peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula  making up the Copper Country region of the state  The Leelanau Peninsula lies in the Northern Lower Michigan region  See Also Michigan Regions  Numerous lakes and marshes mark both peninsulas  and the coast is much indented  Keweenaw Bay  Whitefish Bay  and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula  The Grand and Little Traverse  Thunder  and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula  Michigan has the second longest shoreline of any state—  including of island shoreline   The state has numerous large islands  the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou  Beaver  and Fox groups in Lake Michigan  Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior  Marquette  Bois Blanc  and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron  and Neebish  Sugar  and Drummond islands in St  Mary s River  Michigan has about 150 lighthouses  the most of any U S  state  The first lighthouses in Michigan were built between 1818 and 1822  They were built to project light at night and to serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships and freighters traveling the Great Lakes  See Lighthouses in the United States   The state s rivers are generally small  short and shallow  and few are navigable  The principal ones include the Detroit River  St  Marys River  and St  Clair River which connect the Great Lakes  the Au Sable  Cheboygan  and Saginaw  which flow into Lake Huron  the Ontonagon  and Tahquamenon  which flow into Lake Superior  and the St  Joseph  Kalamazoo  Grand  Muskegon  Manistee  and Escanaba  which flow into Lake Michigan  The state has 11 037 inland lakes  totaling of inland water  in addition to of Great Lakes waters  No point in Michigan is more than six miles  10 km  from an inland lake or more than from one of the Great Lakes   The state is home to a number of areas maintained by the National Park Service including  Isle Royale National Park  located in Lake Superior  about southeast of Thunder Bay  Ontario  Other national protected areas in the state include  Keweenaw National Historical Park  Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore  Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore  Huron National Forest  Manistee National Forest  Hiawatha National Forest  Ottawa National Forest and Father Marquette National Memorial  The largest section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through Michigan   With 78 state parks  19 state recreation areas  and 6 state forests  Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state  These parks and forests include Holland State Park  Mackinac Island State Park  Au Sable State Forest  and Mackinaw State Forest   3 1  Adjacent states and provinces  3 2  Climate  Michigan has a continental climate  although there are two distinct regions  The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula  south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward  have a warmer climate  Köppen climate classification Dfa  with hot summers and cold winters  The northern part of Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate  Köppen Dfb   with warm  but shorter summers and longer  cold to very cold winters  Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February  and into early March in the far northern parts  During the winter through the middle of February the state is frequently subjected to heavy lake effect snow  The state averages from of precipitation annually  however some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost 160  of snowfall per year  Michigan s highest recorded temperature is at Mio on July 13  1936  and the coldest recorded temperature is at Vanderbilt on February 9  1934   The entire state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year  These can be severe  especially in the southern part of the state  The state averages 17 tornadoes per year  which are more common in the extreme southern portion of the state  Portions of the southern border have been nearly as vulnerable historically as parts of Tornado Alley  For this reason  many communities in the very southern portions of the state are equipped with tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes  Farther north  in the Upper Peninsula  tornadoes are rare   3 3  Geology  The geological formation of the state is greatly varied  Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula  being principally of primitive origin   while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula  The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones  limestones  copper and iron bearing rocks  corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada  The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period  Devonian and sub Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state   4  Demographics  4 1  Population  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Michigan was 9 909 877 on July 1  2014  a 0 27% increase since the 2010 United States Census  According to the United States Census Bureau  Michigan s population was 9 938 444 in April 2000  As of the 2010 census  the state s population was 9 883 635  making Michigan the only American state to see a population decrease between 2000 and 2010   The center of population of Michigan is located in Shiawassee County  in the southeastern corner of the civil township of Bennington  which is located northwest of the village of Morrice   As of the 2010 American Community Survey for the U S  Census  the state had a foreign born population of 592 212  or 6 0% of the total  Michigan has the largest Dutch  Finnish  and Macedonian populations in the
