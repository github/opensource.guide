Oxidative phosphorylation  or OXPHOS in short  is the metabolic pathway in which the mitochondria in cells use their structure  enzymes  and energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to reform ATP  Although the many forms of life on earth use a range of different nutrients  ATP is the molecule that supplies energy to metabolism  Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation  This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy  compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis   During oxidative phosphorylation  electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen  in redox reactions  These redox reactions release energy  which is used to form ATP  In eukaryotes  these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the cell s intermembrane wall mitochondria  whereas  in prokaryotes  these proteins are located in the cells  intermembrane space  These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains  In eukaryotes  five main protein complexes are involved  whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present  using a variety of electron donors and acceptors   The energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane  in a process called electron transport  This generates potential energy in the form of a pH gradient and an electrical potential across this membrane  This store of energy is tapped by allowing protons to flow back across the membrane and down this gradient  through a large enzyme called ATP synthase  this process is known as chemiosmosis  This enzyme uses this energy to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate  ADP   in a phosphorylation reaction  This reaction is driven by the proton flow  which forces the rotation of a part of the enzyme  the ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor   Although oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism  it produces reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide  which lead to propagation of free radicals  damaging cells and contributing to disease and  possibly  aging  senescence   The enzymes carrying out this metabolic pathway are also the target of many drugs and poisons that inhibit their activities   1  Overview of energy transfer by chemiosmosis  Oxidative phosphorylation works by using energy releasing chemical reactions to drive energy requiring reactions  The two sets of reactions are said to be coupled  This means one cannot occur without the other  The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain  from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen  is an exergonic process – it releases energy  whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process  which requires an input of energy  Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane  and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane  in a process called chemiosmosis  In practice  this is like a simple electric circuit  with a current of protons being driven from the negative N side of the membrane to the positive P side by the proton pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain  These enzymes are like a battery  as they perform work to drive current through the circuit  The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane  which is often called the proton motive force  It has two components  a difference in proton concentration  a H+ gradient  ΔpH  and a difference in electric potential  with the N side having a negative charge   ATP synthase releases this stored energy by completing the circuit and allowing protons to flow down the electrochemical gradient  back to the N side of the membrane  This kinetic energy drives the rotation of part of the enzymes structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP   The two components of the proton motive force are thermodynamically equivalent  In mitochondria  the largest part of energy is provided by the potential  in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference  Inversely  chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH  However  they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis  At least in the case of the fusobacterium P  modestum it drives the counter rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase   The amount of energy released by oxidative phosphorylation is high  compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation  Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules  but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water  while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs  These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values  in practice  some protons leak across the membrane  lowering the yield of ATP   2  Electron and proton transfer molecules  The electron transport chain carries both protons and electrons  passing electrons from donors to acceptors  and transporting protons across a membrane  These processes use both soluble and protein bound transfer molecules  In mitochondria  electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c  This carries only electrons  and these are transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure  Cytochrome c is also found in some bacteria  where it is located within the periplasmic space   Within the inner mitochondrial membrane  the lipid soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10  Q  carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle  This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic  so it diffuses freely within the membrane  When Q accepts two electrons and two protons  it becomes reduced to the ubiquinol form  QH2   when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons  it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone  Q  form  As a result  if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced on one side of the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other  ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane  Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones  such as menaquinone  in addition to ubiquinone   Within proteins  electrons are transferred between flavin cofactors  iron–sulfur clusters  and cytochromes  There are several types of iron–sulfur cluster  The simplest kind found in the electron transfer chain consists of two iron atoms joined by two atoms of inorganic sulfur  these are called  2Fe–2S  clusters  The second kind  called  4Fe–4S   contains a cube of four iron atoms and four sulfur atoms  Each iron atom in these clusters is coordinated by an additional amino acid  usually by the sulfur atom of cysteine  Metal ion cofactors undergo redox reactions without binding or releasing protons  so in the electron transport chain they serve solely to transport electrons through proteins  Electrons move quite long distances through proteins by hopping along chains of these cofactors  This occurs by quantum tunnelling  which is rapid over distances of less than 1 4 m   3  Eukaryotic electron transport chains  Many catabolic biochemical processes  such as glycolysis  the citric acid cycle  and beta oxidation  produce the reduced coenzyme NADH  This coenzyme contains electrons that have a high transfer potential  in other words  they will release a large amount of energy upon oxidation  However  the cell does not release this energy all at once  as this would be an uncontrollable reaction  Instead  the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy  This set of enzymes  consisting of complexes I through IV  is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion  Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain  but feeds into the pathway at a different point   In eukaryotes  the enzymes in this electron transport system use the energy released from the oxidation of NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion  This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space  and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane  The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP  Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best understood example of this process  The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes  with the exception of anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome   3 1  NADH coenzyme Q oxidoreductase  complex I   NADH coenzyme Q oxidoreductase  also known as NADH dehydrogenase or complex I  is the first protein in the electron transport chain  Complex I is a giant enzyme with the mammalian complex I having 46 subunits and a molecular mass of about 1 000 kilodaltons  kDa   The structure is known in detail only from a bacterium  in most organisms the complex resembles a boot with a large  ball  poking out from the membrane into the mitochondrion  The genes that encode the individual proteins are contained in both the cell nucleus and the mitochondrial genome  as is the case for many enzymes present in the mitochondrion   The reaction that is catalyzed by this enzyme is the two electron oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinone  represented as Q in the equation below   a lipid soluble quinone that is found in the mitochondrion membrane   The start of the reaction  and indeed of the entire electron chain  is the binding of a NADH molecule to complex I and the donation of two electrons  The electrons enter complex I via a prosthetic group attached to the complex  flavin mononucleotide  FMN   The addition of electrons to FMN converts it to its reduced form  FMNH2  The electrons are then transferred through a series of iron–sulfur clusters  the second kind of prosthetic group present in the complex  There are both  2Fe–2S  and  4Fe–4S  iron–sulfur clusters in complex I   As the electrons pass through this complex  four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space  Exactly how this occurs is unclear  but it seems to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N side of the membrane and release them on the P side of the membrane  Finally  the electrons are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane  Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient  as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol  QH2    3 2  Succinate Q oxidoreductase  complex II   Succinate Q oxidoreductase  also known as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase  is a second entry point to the electron transport chain  It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain  Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide  FAD  cofactor  iron–sulfur clusters  and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q  but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species  It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone  As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH  complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient   In some eukaryotes  such as the parasitic worm Ascaris suum  an enzyme similar to complex II  fumarate reductase  menaquinol fumarate oxidoreductase  or QFR   operates in reverse to oxidize ubiquinol and reduce fumarate  This allows the worm to survive in the anaerobic environment of the large intestine  carrying out anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation with fumarate as the electron acceptor  Another unconventional function of complex II is seen in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum  Here  the reversed action of complex II as an oxidase is important in regenerating ubiquinol  which the parasite uses in an unusual form of pyrimidine biosynthesis   3 3  Electron transfer flavoprotein Q oxidoreductase  Electron transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase  ETF Q oxidoreductase   also known as electron transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase  is a third entry point to the electron transport chain  It is an enzyme that accepts electrons from electron transferring flavoprotein in the mitochondrial matrix  and uses these electrons to reduce ubiquinone  This enzyme contains a flavin and a  4Fe–4S  cluster  but  unlike the other respiratory complexes  it attaches to the surface of the membrane and does not cross the lipid bilayer   In mammals  this metabolic pathway is important in beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline  as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl CoA dehydrogenases  In plants  ETF Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness   3 4  Q cytochrome c oxidoreductase  complex III   Q cytochrome c oxidoreductase is also known as cytochrome c reductase  cytochrome bc1 complex  or simply complex III  In mammals  this enzyme is a dimer  with each subunit complex containing 11 protein subunits  an  2Fe 2S  iron–sulfur cluster and three cytochromes  one cytochrome c1 and two b cytochromes  A cytochrome is a kind of electron transferring protein that contains at least one heme group  The iron atoms inside complex III’s heme groups alternate between a reduced ferrous  +2  and oxidized ferric  +3  state as the electrons are transferred through the protein   The reaction catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and the reduction of two molecules of cytochrome c  a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion  Unlike coenzyme Q  which carries two electrons  cytochrome c carries only one electron   As only one of the electrons can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time  the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes  and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle  In the first step  the enzyme binds three substrates  first  QH2  which is then oxidized  with one electron being passed to the second substrate  cytochrome c  The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space  The third substrate is Q  which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q    which is the ubisemiquinone free radical  The first two substrates are released  but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound  In the second step  a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor  The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone  reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix  This QH2 is then released from the enzyme   As coenzyme Q is reduced to ubiquinol on the inner side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other  a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs  adding to the proton gradient  The rather complex two step mechanism by which this occurs is important  as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer  If  instead of the Q cycle  one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c  the efficiency would be halved  with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced   3 5  Cytochrome c oxidase  complex IV   Cytochrome c oxidase  also known as complex IV  is the final protein complex in the electron transport chain  The mammalian enzyme has an extremely complicated structure and contains 13 subunits  two heme groups  as well as multiple metal ion cofactors – in all  three atoms of copper  one of magnesium and one of zinc   This enzyme mediates the final reaction in the electron transport chain and transfers electrons to oxygen  while pumping protons across the membrane  The final electron acceptor oxygen  which is also called the terminal electron acceptor  is reduced to water in this step  Both the direct pumping of protons and the consumption of matrix protons in the reduction of oxygen contribute to the proton gradient  The reaction catalyzed is the oxidation of cytochrome c and the reduction of oxygen   3 6  Alternative reductases and oxidases  Many eukaryotic organisms have electron transport chains that differ from the much studied mammalian enzymes described above  For example  plants have alternative NADH oxidases  which oxidize NADH in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondrial matrix  and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool  These enzymes do not transport protons  and  therefore  reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane   Another example of a divergent electron transport chain is the alternative oxidase  which is found in plants  as well as some fungi  protists  and possibly some animals  This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen   The electron transport pathways produced by these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway  The advantages produced by a shortened pathway are not entirely clear  However  the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold  reactive oxygen species  and infection by pathogens  as well as other factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain  Alternative pathways might  therefore  enhance an organisms  resistance to injury  by reducing oxidative stress   3 7  Organization of complexes  The original model for how the respiratory chain complexes are organized was that they diffuse freely and independently in the mitochondrial membrane  However  recent data suggest that the complexes might form higher order structures called supercomplexes or  respirasomes   In this model  the various complexes exist as organized sets of interacting enzymes  These associations might allow channeling of substrates between the various enzyme complexes  increasing the rate and efficiency of electron transfer  Within such mammalian supercomplexes  some components would be present in higher amounts than others  with some data suggesting a ratio between complexes I II III IV and the ATP synthase of approximately 1 1 3 7 4  However  the debate over this supercomplex hypothesis is not completely resolved  as some data do not appear to fit with this model   4  Prokaryotic electron transport chains  In contrast to the general similarity in structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes  bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron transfer enzymes  These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates  In common with eukaryotes  prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient  In the bacteria  oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli is understood in most detail  while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood   The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons  This allows prokaryotes to grow under a wide variety of environmental conditions  In E  coli  for example  oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents  which are listed below  The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced  with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials   As shown above  E  coli can grow with reducing agents such as formate  hydrogen  or lactate as electron donors  and nitrate  DMSO  or oxygen as acceptors  The larger the difference in midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent  the more energy is released when they react  Out of these compounds  the succinate fumarate pair is unusual  as its midpoint potential is close to zero  Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available  or fumarate can be reduced to succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate  These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase  respectively   Some prokaryotes use redox pairs that have only a small difference in midpoint potential  For example  nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate  donating the electrons to oxygen  The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP  but not enough to produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism  This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse  causing complex I to generate NADH   Prokaryotes control their use of these electron donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced  in response to environmental conditions  This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool  This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together  linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate  These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design  with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems   In addition to this metabolic diversity  prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes – different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction  For example  in E  coli  there are two different types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor  Under highly aerobic conditions  the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron  However  if levels of oxygen fall  they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron  but has a high affinity for oxygen   5  ATP synthase  complex V   ATP synthase  also called complex V  is the final enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway  This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions in the same way in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate  Pi   Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four  with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio  to suit different conditions   This phosphorylation reaction is an equilibrium  which can be shifted by altering the proton motive force  In the absence of a proton motive force  the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left  hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane  However  when the proton motive force is high  the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction  it proceeds from left to right  allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP  Indeed  in the closely related vacuolar type H+ ATPases  the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments  by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP   ATP synthase is a massive protein complex with a mushroom like shape  The mammalian enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 kilodaltons  The portion embedded within the membrane is called FO and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel  The stalk and the ball shaped headpiece is called F1 and is the site of ATP synthesis  The ball shaped complex at the end of the F1 portion contains six proteins of two different kinds  three α subunits and three β subunits   whereas the  stalk  consists of one protein  the γ subunit  with the tip of the stalk extending into the ball of α and β subunits  Both the α and β subunits bind nucleotides  but only the β subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction  Reaching along the side of the F1 portion and back into the membrane is a long rod like subunit that anchors the α and β subunits into the base of the enzyme   As protons cross the membrane through the channel in the base of ATP synthase  the FO proton driven motor rotates  Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel  This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle  the γ subunit stalk  within the α and β subunits  The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side arm  which acts as a stator  This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP  This ATP synthesis reaction is called the binding change mechanism and involves the active site of a β subunit cycling between three states  In the  open  state  ADP and phosphate enter the active site  shown in brown in the diagram   The protein then closes up around the molecules and binds them loosely – the  loose  state  shown in red   The enzyme then changes shape again and forces these molecules together  with the active site in the resulting  tight  state  shown in pink  binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high affinity  Finally  the active site cycles back to the open state  releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate  ready for the next cycle   In some bacteria and archaea  ATP synthesis is driven by the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane  rather than the movement of protons  Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase  a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits  It is possible that  in some species  the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium driven ATP synthase  but this might not be true in all cases   6  Reactive oxygen species  Molecular oxygen is an ideal terminal electron acceptor because it is a strong oxidizing agent  The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates  Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water  which is harmless  transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions  which are dangerously reactive   These reactive oxygen species and their reaction products  such as the hydroxyl radical  are very harmful to cells  as they oxidize proteins and cause mutations in DNA  This cellular damage might contribute to disease and is proposed as one cause of aging   The cytochrome c oxidase complex is highly efficient at reducing oxygen to water  and it releases very few partly reduced intermediates  however small amounts of superoxide anion and peroxide are produced by the electron transport chain  Particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme Q in complex III  as a highly reactive ubisemiquinone free radical is formed as an intermediate in the Q cycle  This unstable species can lead to electron  leakage  when electrons transfer directly to oxygen  forming superoxide  As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials  it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation  For instance  oxidants can activate uncoupling proteins that reduce membrane potential   To counteract these reactive oxygen species  cells contain numerous antioxidant systems  including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin E  and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase  catalase  and peroxidases  which detoxify the reactive species  limiting damage to the cell   7  Inhibitors  There are several well known drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation  Although any one of these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain  inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process  For example  if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase  protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion  As a result  the proton pumps are unable to operate  as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome  NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use   Not all inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation are toxins  In brown adipose tissue  regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis  This rapid respiration produces heat  and is particularly important as a way of maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals  although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells  responses to stress   8  History  The field of oxidative phosphorylation began with the report in 1906 by Arthur Harden of a vital role for phosphate in cellular fermentation  but initially only sugar phosphates were known to be involved  However  in the early 1940s  the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP was firmly established by Herman Kalckar  confirming the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941  Later  in 1949  Morris Friedkin and Albert L  Lehninger proved that the coenzyme NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP   For another twenty years  the mechanism by which ATP is generated remained mysterious  with scientists searching for an elusive  high energy intermediate  that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions  This puzzle was solved by Peter D  Mitchell with the publication of the chemiosmotic theory in 1961  At first  this proposal was highly controversial  but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a Nobel prize in 1978  Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved  with major contributions being made by David E  Green on the complexes of the electron transport chain  as well as Efraim Racker on the ATP synthase  A critical step towards solving the mechanism of the ATP synthase was provided by Paul D  Boyer  by his development in 1973 of the  binding change  mechanism  followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982  More recent work has included structural studies on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by John E  Walker  with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997   9  See also  Respirometry  TIM TOM Complex  10
