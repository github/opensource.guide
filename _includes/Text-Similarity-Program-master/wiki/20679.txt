that helped protect content from being pirated  Its two core legacy products were called RipGuard and ACP  analog copy protection    2 7 1  RipGuard  Macrovision introduced its RipGuard technology in February 2005  It was designed to prevent or reduce digital DVD copying by altering the format of the DVD content to disrupt the ripping software  Although the technology could be circumvented by several current DVD rippers such as AnyDVD or DVDFab  Macrovision claimed that 95% of casual users lack the knowledge and or determination to be able to copy a DVD with RipGuard technology   Analog video formats convey video signals as a series of “lines”  Most of these lines are used for constructing the visible image  and are shown on the screen  But several more lines exist which do not convey visual information  Known as the vertical blanking interval  VBI   these extra lines historically served no purpose other than to contain the vertical synchronizing pulses  but in more modern implementations they are used to carry or convey different things in different countries  for example closed captioning   2 7 2  ACP  Macrovision s legacy analog copy protection  ACP  works by implanting a series of excessive voltage pulses within the off screen VBI lines of video  These pulses were included physically within pre existing recordings on VHS and Betamax  and were generated upon playback by a chip in DVD players and digital cable or satellite boxes  A DVD recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is  copy protected  followed by aborting the recording  VCRs  in turn  react to these excessive voltage pulses by compensating with their automatic gain control circuitry  causing the recorded picture to wildly change brightness  rendering it annoying to watch  The system was only effective on VCRs made at around the mid 1980s and later   A later form of Macrovision s analog copy protection  called Level II ACP  introduced multiple 180 degree phase inversions to the analog signal s colorburst  Also known as colorstriping  this technology caused numerous off color bands to appear within the picture   Another form of analog copy protection  known as CGMS A  is added by DVD players and digital cable satellite boxes  While not invented by Macrovision  the company s products implemented it  CGMS A consists of a  flag  within the vertical blanking interval  essentially data  like closed captioning  which digital recording devices search for  If present  it refused to record the signal  just as with the earlier ACP technology  Unlike digital recording equipment  however  analog VCRs do not respond to CGMS A encoded video and would record it successfully if ACP is not also present   Historically  the original Macrovision technology was considered a nuisance to some specialist users because it could interfere with other electronic equipment  For example  if one were to run a video signal through a VCR before the television  some VCRs will output a ruined signal regardless of whether it is recording  This also occurs in some TV VCR combo sets  Apart from this  many DVD recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for Macrovision signals  and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal DVD dubs of people s old home movies and the like  This widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat Macrovision  The signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers  devices for improving the quality of video for large projection TVs  and some high end television comb filters  In addition  Macrovision confuses many upconverters  devices that convert a video signal to a higher resolution   causing them to shut down and refuse to play Macrovision content   There are also devices called stabilizers  video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the Macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system  The principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal  and forcing the lines occurring during the VBI to black level  removing the AGC confusing pulses  They can be easily built by hobbyists  as nothing more than a cheap microcontroller together with an analog multiplexer and a little other circuitry is needed  Individuals less experienced with such things can purchase video stabilizers   Discs made with DVD copying programs such as DVD Shrink automatically disable any Macrovision copy protection  The ease with which Macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of DVD releases that do not have copy protection of any kind  Content Scramble System  CSS  or Macrovision   United States fair use law  as interpreted in the decision over Betamax  Sony Corp  v  Universal City Studios   dictates that consumers are fully within their legal rights to copy videos they own  However  the legality has changed somewhat with the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act  After April 26  2002  no VCR may be manufactured or imported without Automatic Gain Control circuitry  which renders VCRs vulnerable to Macrovision   This is contained in title 17  section 1201 k  of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  However  there are a number of mostly older VCR models on the market that are not affected by Macrovision   On October 26  2001  the sale  purchase  or manufacture of any device that has no commercial purpose other than disabling Macrovision copy protection was made illegal under section 1201 a  of the same controversial act   In June 2005  Macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to  Lightning UK    the maker of DVD Decrypter  a program that allows users to back up their DVDs by bypassing CSS and Macrovision  They later acquired the rights to this software   In June 2005  Macrovision sued Sima Products under section 1201 of the DMCA  claiming that Sima s video processors provided a way to circumvent Macrovision s analog copy protection  Sima received an injunction barring the sale of this device  but the parties ultimately settled without a judgment on the legal issues   3  Acquisitions  3 1  As Macrovision  In 2000  Macrovision acquired Globetrotter  creators of the FLEXlm  which was subsequently renamed Flexnet   In 2002  Macrovision acquired
