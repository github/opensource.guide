system market with MS DOS in the mid 1980s  followed by Microsoft Windows  The company s 1986 initial public offering  and subsequent rise in its share price  created three billionaires and an estimated 12 000 millionaires from Microsoft employees  Since the 1990s  it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions  In May 2011

Founding and company beginnings  Paul Allen and Bill Gates  childhood friends with a passion in computer programming  were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills  In 1972 they founded their first company named Traf O Data  which offered a rudimentary computer that tracked and analyzed automobile traffic data  Allen went on to pursue a degree in computer science at the University of Washington  later dropping out of school to work at Honeywell  Gates began studies at Harvard  The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems s  MITS  Altair 8800 microcomputer  Allen suggested that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device  after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter  MITS requested a demonstration  Since they didn t actually have one  Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter  Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device  the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque  New Mexico in March 1975  MITS agreed to distribute it  marketing it as Altair BASIC  They officially established Microsoft on April 4  1975  with Gates as the CEO  Allen came up with the original name of  Micro Soft   the combination of the words microprocessor and software  as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article  In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan  resulting in its first international office   ASCII Microsoft   The company moved to a new home in Bellevue  Washington in January 1979   Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix  called Xenix  However  it was MS DOS that solidified the company s dominance  After negotiations with Digital Research failed  IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP M OS  which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer  IBM PC   For this deal  Microsoft purchased a CP M clone called 86 DOS from Seattle Computer Products  branding it as MS DOS  which IBM rebranded to PC DOS  Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981  Microsoft retained ownership of MS DOS  Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS  other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles  but no such restriction applied to the operating systems  Due to various factors  such as MS DOS s available software selection  Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor  The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983  as well as a publishing division named Microsoft Press  Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing Hodgkin s disease   1 2  1984–94  Windows and Office  While jointly developing a new OS with IBM in 1984  OS 2  Microsoft released Microsoft Windows  a graphical extension

left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage   On July 27  1994  the U S  Department of Justice  Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said  in part   Beginning in 1988  and continuing until July 15  1994  Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti competitive  per processor  licenses  Under a per processor license  an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor  whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non Microsoft operating system  In effect  the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty  or tax  on the OEM s use of a competing PC operating system  Since 1988  Microsoft s use of per processor licenses has increased    1 3  1995–2005  Internet and the 32 bit era  Following Bill Gates s internal  Internet Tidal Wave memo  on May 26  1995  Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand

start button  and 32 bit compatibility  similar to NT  it provided the Win32 API  Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN  and for OEMs Internet Explorer  a web browser  Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser  and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus  pack  Branching out into new markets in 1996  Microsoft and NBC Universal created a new 24 7 cable news station  MSNBC  Microsoft created Windows CE 1 0  a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints  such as personal digital assistants  In October 1997  the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court  stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows   Bill Gates handed over the CEO position on January 13  2000  to Steve Ballmer  an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980  creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect  Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to  among other things  increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software  Critics decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software  and over how computers behave  a form of digital rights management  for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner  but also secured against its owner as well  On April 3  2000  a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v  Microsoft  calling the company an  abusive monopoly   it settled with the U S  Department of Justice in 2004  On

another fine of €899million  $1 4billion  for Microsoft s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27  2008  saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers  Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that  these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved    2007 also saw the creation

second quarter of the fiscal year  Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts  the price of Microsoft s stock remained steady for years   One of Microsoft s business tactics  described by an executive as  embrace  extend and extinguish   initially embraces a competing standard or product  then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard  which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use Microsoft s new version  Various companies and governments sue Microsoft over this set of tactics  resulting in billions of dollars in rulings against the company  Microsoft claims that the original strategy is not anti competitive  but rather an exercise of its discretion to implement features it believes customers want

of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase  Phil Radford of Greenpeace said  we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old  polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today   and called on  Amazon  Microsoft and other leaders of the information technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud based data centers   In 2013  Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers   Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace s Guide to Greener Electronics  16th Edition  that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals  recycling and climate change  Microsoft s timeline for phasing out BFRs and

to a bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle  the company did not want to delay the construction any further   Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011   5 3  Marketing  In 2004  Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership  TCO  of Windows Server 2003 to Linux  the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux  thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company  i e  lower TCO   This spurred a wave of related studies  a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux  although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products  Another study  released by the Open Source Development Labs  claimed that the Microsoft studies were  simply outdated and one sided  and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons   As part of the  Get the Facts  campaign  Microsoft highlighted the  NET trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange  claiming that it provided  five nines  reliability  After suffering extended downtime and unreliability the LSE announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux based one in 2010   In 2012  Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn  whom the New York Times called  famous for bulldozing  his political opponents as Executive

Google is  screwing  consumers with search results rigged to favor Google s paid advertisers  that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results which favor Google products  Tech publications like Tech Crunch have been highly critical of the ad campaign  while Google employees have embraced it   5 4  Lay off  In July 2014  Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18 000 employees  Microsoft employed 127 104 people as of June 5  2014  making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever  It will include 12 500 professional and factory personnel  Previously  Microsoft has laid off 5 800 jobs in 2009 in line with US financial crisis   In September 2014  Microsoft laid off 2 100 people  including 747 people in the Seattle Redmond area  where the company is headquartered  The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced  This brings the total

United States Government  Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government  prior to the public release of the fix  A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U S  government   Following media reports about PRISM  NSA s massive electronic surveillance program  in May 2013  several technology companies were identified as participants  including Microsoft  According to leaks of said program  Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007  However  in June 2013  an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program   We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so  and never on a voluntary basis  In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers  If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data  we don t participate in it  During the first six months in 2013  Microsoft had received requests that affected between 15 000 and 15 999 accounts  In December
