A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit  one leg of which includes the unknown component  Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer  It was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843  One of the Wheatstone bridge s initial uses was for the purpose of soils analysis and comparison   1  Operation  In the figure  is the unknown resistance to be measured    and are resistors of known resistance and the resistance of is adjustable  If the ratio of the two resistances in the known leg is equal to the ratio of the two in the unknown leg   then the voltage between the two midpoints  B and D  will be zero and no current will flow through the galvanometer   If the bridge is unbalanced  the direction of the current indicates whether is too high or too low  is varied until there is no current through the galvanometer  which then reads zero   Detecting zero current with a galvanometer can be done to extremely high accuracy  Therefore  if   and are known to high precision  then can be measured to high precision  Very small changes in disrupt the balance and are readily detected   At the point of balance  the ratio of  Alternatively  if     and are known  but is not adjustable  the voltage difference across or current flow through the meter can be used to calculate the value of   using Kirchhoff s circuit laws  also known as Kirchhoff s rules   This setup is frequently used in strain gauge and resistance thermometer measurements  as it is usually faster to read a voltage level off a meter than to adjust a resistance to zero the voltage   2  Derivation  First  Kirchhoff s first rule is used to find the currents in junctions B and D   Then  Kirchhoff s second rule is used for finding the voltage in the loops ABD and BCD   When the bridge is balanced  then   so the second set of equations can be rewritten as   Then  the equations are divided and rearranged  giving   From the first rule  and   The desired value of is now known to be given as   If all four resistor values and the supply voltage    are known  and the resistance of the galvanometer is high enough that is negligible  the voltage across the bridge    can be found by working out the voltage from each potential divider and subtracting one from the other  The equation for this is   where is the voltage of node D relative to node B   3  Significance  The Wheatstone bridge illustrates the concept of a difference measurement  which can be extremely accurate  Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure capacitance  inductance  impedance and other quantities  such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample  with an explosimeter  The Kelvin bridge was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances  In many cases  the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon  such as force  temperature  pressure  etc   which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly   The concept was extended to alternating current measurements by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and further improved by Alan Blumlein around 1926   4  Modifications of the fundamental bridge  The Wheatstone bridge is the fundamental bridge  but there are other modifications that can be made to measure various kinds of resistances when the fundamental Wheatstone bridge is not suitable  Some of the modifications are   Carey Foster bridge  for measuring small resistances  Kelvin Varley Slide  Kelvin bridge  Maxwell bridge  5  See also  Phantom circuit   a circuit using a balanced bridge  Post Office Box  Potentiometer  Potential divider  Ohmmeter  Resistance thermometer  Strain gauge  6  References  7  External links  National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
