United States   Richard Stengel was the managing editor from May 2006 to October 2013  when he joined the U S  State Department  Nancy Gibbs has been the managing editor since October 2013   1  History  Time magazine was created in 1923 by Briton Hadden and Henry Luce  making it the first weekly news magazine in the United States  The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor respectively of the Yale Daily News  They first called the proposed magazine Facts  They wanted to emphasize brevity  so that a busy man could read it in an hour  They changed the name to Time and used the slogan  Take Time–It s Brief   Hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease Luce and saw Time as important but also fun  which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities  including politicians   the entertainment industry  and pop culture—criticized as too light for serious news   It set out to tell the news through people  and for many decades the magazine s cover depicted a single person  The first issue of Time was published on March 3  1923  featuring Joseph G  Cannon  the retired Speaker of the House of Representatives  on its cover  a facsimile reprint of Issue No  1  including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original  was included with copies of the February 28  1938 issue as a commemoration of the magazine s 15th anniversary  The cover price was 15¢  equivalent to $ today  On Hadden s death in 1929  Luce became the dominant man at Time and a major figure in the history of 20th century media  According to Time Inc   The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1972–2004 by Robert Elson   Roy Edward Larsen       was to play a role second only to Luce s in the development of Time Inc   In his book  The March of Time  1935–1951  Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was  originally circulation manager and then general manager of Time  later publisher of Life  for many years president of Time Inc   and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce    Around the time they were raising $100 000 from wealthy Yale alumni like Henry P  Davison  partner of J P  Morgan & Co   publicity man Martin Egan and J P  Morgan & Co  banker Dwight Morrow  Henry Luce  and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922 – although Larsen was a Harvard graduate and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates  After Hadden died in 1929  Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc   using money he obtained from selling RKO stock which he had inherited from his father  who was the head of the Benjamin Franklin Keith theatre chain in New England  However  after Briton Hadden s death  the largest Time stockholder was Henry Luce  who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion   at his right hand was Larsen   Time s second largest stockholder  according to Time Inc   The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941  In 1929  Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc  director and vice president  J  P  Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks  both over Time and Fortune  Other shareholders were Brown Brothers W  A  Harriman & Co   and The New York Trust Company  Standard Oil    By the time Henry Luce died in 1967  the Time Inc  stock which Luce owned was worth about $109 million and yielded him a yearly dividend income of more than $2 4 million  according to Curtis Prendergast s The World of Time Inc  The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise 1957–1983  The value of the Larsen family s Time stock was now worth about $80 million during the 1960s and Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc  director and the chairman of its Executive Committee  before serving as Time s vice chairman of the board until the middle of 1979  According to the September 10  1979 issue of The New York Times   Mr  Larsen was the only employee in the company s history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65    After Time magazine began publishing its weekly issues in March 1923  Roy Larsen was able to increase its circulation by utilizing U S  radio and movie theaters around the world  It often promoted both Time magazine and U S  political and corporate interests  According to The March of Time  as early as 1924  Larsen had brought Time into the infant radio business with the broadcast of a 15 minute sustaining quiz show entitled Pop Question which survived until 1925   Then  in 1928  Larsen  undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10 minute programme series of brief news summaries  drawn from current issues of Time magazine       which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States    Larsen next arranged for a 30 minute radio program  The March of Time  to be broadcast over CBS  beginning on March 6  1931  Each week  the program presented a dramatisation of the week s news for its listeners  thus Time magazine itself was brought  to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence   according to Time Inc   The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941  leading to an increased circulation of the magazine during the 1930s  Between 1931 and 1937  Larsen s The March of Time radio program was broadcast over CBS radio and between 1937 and 1945 it was broadcast over NBC radio – except for the 1939 to 1941 period when it was not aired  People Magazine was based on s People page   Time became part of Time Warner in 1989  along with Warner Bros  when Time  Inc  and Warner Communications merged  Jason McManus succeeded Henry Grunwald in 1988 as Editor in Chief and oversaw the transition before Norman Pearlstine succeeded him in 1995   In 2000  the magazine became part of AOL Time Warner  which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003   In 2007  Time moved from a Monday subscription newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays  and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday  The magazine actually began in 1923 with Friday publication   During early 2007  the year s first issue was delayed for roughly a week due to  editorial changes   including the layoff of 49 employees   In 2009 Time announced that they were introducing a personalized print magazine  Mine  mixing content from a range of Time Warner publications based on the reader s preferences  The new magazine met with a poor reception  with criticism that its focus was too broad to be truly personal   The magazine has an online archive with the unformatted text for every article published  The articles are indexed and were converted from scanned images using optical character recognition technology  There are still minor errors in the text that are remnants of the conversion into digital format   Time Inc  and Apple have come to an agreement wherein U S  subscribers to Time will be able to read the iPad versions for free  at least until the two companies sort out a viable digital subscription model   In January 2013  Time Inc  announced that it would cut nearly 500 jobs – roughly 6% of its 8 000 staff worldwide  Although Time magazine has maintained high sales  its ad pages have declined significantly over time   Also in January 2013  Time Inc  named Martha Nelson as the first female editor in chief of its magazine division  In September 2013 Nancy Gibbs was named as the first female managing editor of Time magazine   2  Circulation  During the second half of 2009 the magazine saw a 34 9% decline in newsstand sales  During the first half of 2010  there was another decline of at least one third in Time magazine sales  In the second half of 2010  Time magazine newsstand sales declined by about 12% to just over 79 000 copies per week   3  Style  Time initially possessed a distinctive writing style  making regular use of inverted sentences  This was parodied in 1936 by Wolcott Gibbs in The New Yorker   Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind       Where it all will end  knows God    Until the mid 1970s  Time had a weekly section called  Listings   which contained capsule summaries and or reviews of then current significant films  plays  musicals  television programs  and literary bestsellers similar to The New Yorkers  Current Events  section   Time is also known for its signature red border  first introduced in 1927  The iconic red border was homaged or satirized by Seattle s The Stranger newspaper in 2010   The border has only been changed four times since 1927  The issue released shortly after the September 11 attacks on the United States featured a black border to symbolize mourning  However  this edition was a special  extra  edition published quickly for the breaking news of the event  the next regularly scheduled issue contained the red border  Additionally  the April 28  2008 Earth Day issue  dedicated to environmental issues  contained a green border  The next change in border was in the September 19  2011 issue  commemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11 attacks with a metallic silver border  The most recent change  again with a silver border  was in the December 31  2012 issue  noting Barack Obama s selection as Person of the Year   In 2007  Time engineered a style overhaul of the magazine  Among other changes  the magazine reduced the red cover border in order to promote featured stories  enlarged column titles  reduced the number of featured stories  increased white space around articles  and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers  The changes have met both criticism and praise   4  Special editions  4 1  Person of the Year  Times most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual  Person of the Year   formerly  Man of the Year   cover story  in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the past 12 months  The distinction is supposed to go to the person who  for good or ill  has most affected the course of the year  it is therefore not necessarily an honor or a reward  In the past  such figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin have been Man of the Year   In 2006  the Person of the Year was designated as  You   a move that was met with split reviews  Some thought the concept was creative  others wanted an actual person of the year  Editors Pepper and Timmer reflected that  if it had been a mistake   we re only going to make it once    4 2  Time 100  In recent years Time has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year  Originally  they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century  These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list  There have  in some cases  been over 100 people  when two people have made the list together  sharing one spot   The magazine also compiled  All TIME 100 best novels  and  All TIME 100 best movies  lists in 2005   The 100 Best TV Shows of All TIME  in 2007  and  All TIME 100 Fashion Icons  in 2012   4 3  Red X covers  During its history  for four non consecutive occasions  Time has released a special issue with a cover showing a red X scrawled over the face of a man  The first Time magazine with a red X cover was released
