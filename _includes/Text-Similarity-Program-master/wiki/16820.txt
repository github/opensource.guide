Dame Kathleen Mary Kenyon  DBE  5 January 1906 舑 24 August 1978   was a leading archaeologist of Neolithic culture in the Fertile Crescent  Former Principal of St Hugh s College  Oxford and best known for her excavations of Jericho and Bangalow in 1952 1958  she has been called the most influential female archaeologist of the 20th century   1  Biography  Kathleen Kenyon was born in London in 1906  She was the eldest daughter of Sir Frederic Kenyon  biblical scholar and later director of the British Museum  Her grandfather was lawyer and Fellow of All Souls College  John Robert Kenyon  She grew up in Bloomsbury  London  in a house attached to the British Museum  with her mother  Amy Kenyon  and sister Nora Kenyon  Known for being hard headed and stubborn  Kathleen grew up as a tomboy  fishing  climbing trees and playing a variety of sports   Determined that she and her sister should be well educated  Kathleen s father encouraged wide reading and independent study  In later years Kenyon would remark that her father s position at the British Museum was particularly helpful for her education  Kathleen was an excellent student  winning awards at school and particularly excelling in history  She studied first at St Paul s Girls  School  where she was Head Girl  before winning an Exhibition to read History at Somerville College  Oxford  While at Oxford  Kenyon won a Blue for her college and became the first female president of the Oxford University Archaeological Society  She graduated in 1929 and began a career in archaeology   Although working on several important sites across Europe  it was her excavations in Jericho in the 1950s that established her as one of the foremost archaeologists in the field  In 1962 Kenyon was made Principle of St Hugh s College  Oxford  She retired in 1973 to Erbistock and was appointed a DBE  Kenyon never married  From 1974  Kenyon was the Honorary Vice President of the Chester Archaeological Society   2  Archaeological career  A career in archaeology was first suggested to Kathleen by Margery Fry  librarian at Somerville College  After graduation Kenyon s first field experience was as a photographer for the pioneering excavations at Great Zimbabwe in 1929  led by Gertrude Caton Thompson  Returning to England  Kenyon joined the archaeological couple Mortimer Wheeler and his wife Tessa Wheeler on their excavation of the Romano British settlement of Verulamium  St Albans   20 miles north of London  Working there each summer between 1930 and 1935  Kenyon learned from Mortimer Wheeler the discipline of meticulously controlled and recorded stratigraphic excavation  Wheeler entrusted her with the direction of the excavation of the Roman theatre   In the years 1931 to 1934 Kenyon worked simultaneously at Samaria  then under the administration of the British Mandate for Palestine  with John Crowfoot and Grace Crowfoot  There she cut a stratigraphic trench across the summit of the mound and down the northern and southern slopes  exposing the Iron II to the Roman period stratigraphic sequence of the site  In addition to providing crucial dating material for the Iron Age stratigraphy of Palestine  she obtained key stratified data for the study of Eastern terra sigilata ware   In 1934 Kenyon was closely associated with the Wheelers in the foundation of the Institute of Archaeology of University College London  From 1936 to 1939 she carried out important excavations at the Jewry Wall in the city of Leicester  These were published in the Illustrated London News1937 with pioneering reconstruction drawings by the artist Alan Sorrell whom she had happened to notice sketching her dig   2 1  Digging Jericho  During the Second World War  Kenyon served as Divisional Commander of the Red Cross in Hammersmith  London  and later as Acting Director and Secretary of the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London   After the war  she excavated in Southwark  at The Wrekin  Shropshire and elsewhere in Britain  as well as at Sabratha  a Roman city in Libya  As a member of the Council of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem  BSAJ   Kenyon was involved in the efforts to reopen the School after the hiatus of the Second World War  In January 1951 she travelled to the Transjordan and undertook excavations in the West Bank at Jericho  Tell es Sultan  on behalf of the BSAJ  Initial finding were first viewed by the public in the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain 1951 with a reconstruction drawing by Alan Sorrell  Her work at Jericho  from 1952 until 1958  made her world famous and established a lasting legacy in the archaeological methodology of the Levant  Ground breaking discoveries concerning the Neolithic cultures of the Levant were made in this ancient settlement  Her excavation of the Early Bronze Age walled city and the external cemeteries of the end of the Early Bronze Age  together with her analysis of the stratified pottery of these periods established her as the leading authority on that period  Kenyon focused her attention on the absence of certain Cypriot pottery at City IV  arguing for an older destruction date than that of her predecessors  Jericho was recognized as the oldest continuously occupied settlement in history because of her discoveries  At the same time she also completed the publication of the excavations at Samaria  Her volume  Samaria Sebaste III  The Objects  appeared in 1957  Having completed her excavations at Jericho in 1958  Kenyon excavated in Jerusalem from 1961 to 1967  concentrating on the  City of David  to the immediate south of the Temple Mount   Although Kenyon had no doubt the sites she excavated were linked to the Old Testament narrative she nevertheless drew attention to inconsistencies  concluding that Solomon s  stables  at Megiddo were totally impractical for holding horses  1978 72   and that Jericho fell long before Joshua s arrival  1978 35   Consequently Kenyon s work has been cited to support the Minimalist School of Biblical Archaeology   2 2  Legacy  Kenyon s legacy in the field of excavation technique and ceramic methodology is attested to by Larry G  Herr  one of the directors of the Madaba Plains Project  He attributes to her directly the first of the key events  after the advances made by William F  Albright at Tell Beit Mirsim in the 1920s  that brought about our modern understanding of pottery in the southern Levant    The first event was the refinement of stratigraphic techniques that Kathleen Kenyon s dig at Jericho catalyzed  The strict separation of earth layers  or archaeological sediments  also allowed the strict separation of ceramic assemblages   Herr detects Kenyon s powerful indirect influence in the second event that promoted advance within ceramic methodology  namely    the importation of Kenyon s digging techniques by Larry Toombs and Joe Callaway to Ernest Wright s project at Balata  Here  they combined Wright s interest in ceramic typology in the best Albright tradition with Kenyon s methods of excavation  which allowed the isolation of clear  stratigraphically determined pottery assemblages   Herr summarises the somewhat mixed nature of Kenyon s legacy  for all the positive advances  there were also shortcomings    Kenyon    did not capitalize fully on  the  implication of her stratigraphic techniques by producing final publications promptly  Indeed her method of digging  which most of us have subsequently adopted  causes a proliferation of loci that excavators often have difficulty keeping straight long enough to produce coherent published stratigraphic syntheses  Moreover  her insistence that excavation proceed in narrow trenches denies us  when we use the Jericho reports  the confidence that her loci  and the pottery assemblages that go with them  represent understandable human activity patterns over coherently connected living areas  The individual layers  insufficiently exposed horizontally  simply cannot be interpreted credibly in terms of function  This further makes publication difficult  both to produce and to use   From 1948 to 1962 she lectured in Levantine Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology  University College London  Kenyon s teaching complemented her excavations at Jericho and Jerusalem  In 1962  she was appointed Principal of St Hugh s College  Oxford   3  Awards and commemoration  The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem  amalgamated within the Council for British Research in the Levant  CBRL  in 1998  was officially renamed the Kenyon Institute on 10 July 2003 in honour of Kathleen Kenyon  On her retirement from Oxford in 1973  she was appointed a DBE   4  Kenyon Collection  Baylor University houses the Kathleen Kenyon Archaeology Collection  The rare books collection was purchased in 1984 from her estate  The collection contains materials related to her archaeological research   Miriam C  Davis  writer of Dame Kathleen Kenyon  Digging Up the Holy Land extensively used the Baylor collection as she researched for her book  After Davis wrote the biography  she presented her findings at Baylor  choosing Baylor specifically as a thank you for giving her access to the outstanding Kenyon collection   5  Published works  1942 The Buildings at Samaria   Samaria Sebaste I   London  1942  co authored with Crowfoot
