Ragtime  alternatively spelled rag time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918  Its main characteristic trait is its syncopated  or  ragged   rhythm  It began as dance music in the red light districts of African American communities in St  Louis and New Orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano  Ernest Hogan was an innovator and key pioneer who helped develop the musical genre  and is credited with coining the term ragtime  Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa  with additional polyrhythms coming from African music  The ragtime composer Scott Joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the Maple Leaf Rag and a string of ragtime hits such as The Entertainer that followed  although he was later forgotten by all but a small  dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s  For at least 12 years after its publication  Maple Leaf Rag heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines  harmonic progressions or metric patterns   Ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public s imagination after 1917  but there have been numerous revivals since the music has been re discovered  First in the early 1940s  many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records  A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records  and new rags were composed  published  and recorded  In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin s work which was nominated for a Grammy Award  In 1973 The New England Ragtime Ensemble  then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble  recorded The Red Back Book  a compilation of some of Scott Joplin s rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president Gunther Schuller  The album won a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named Billboard s Top Classical Album of 1974  Subsequently the motion picture The Sting brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes  The film s rendering of Joplin s 1902 rag The Entertainer  performed by Marvin Hamlisch  was a Top 5 hit in 1974   Ragtime  with Joplin s work at the forefront  has been cited as an American equivalent of minuets by Mozart  mazurkas by Chopin  or waltzes by Brahms  Ragtime influenced classical composers including Erik Satie  Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky   1  Historical context  Ragtime originated in African American music in the late 19th century  descending from the jigs and march music played by African American bands  By the start of the 20th century  it became widely popular throughout North America and was listened and danced to  performed  and written by people of many different subcultures  A distinctly American musical style  ragtime may be considered a synthesis of African syncopation and European classical music  especially the marches made popular by John Philip Sousa   Some early piano rags are entitled marches  and  jig  and  rag  were used interchangeably in the mid 1890s  Ragtime was also preceded by its close relative the cakewalk  In 1895  black entertainer Ernest Hogan published two of the earliest sheet music rags  one of which   All Coons Look Alike to Me   eventually sold a million copies  As fellow black musician Tom Fletcher said  Hogan was the  first to put on paper the kind of rhythm that was being played by non reading musicians   While the song s success helped introduce the country to ragtime rhythms  its use of racial slurs created a number of derogatory imitation tunes  known as  coon songs  because of their use of extremely racist and stereotypical images of blacks  In Hogan s later years he admitted shame and a sense of  race betrayal  for the song while also expressing pride in helping bring ragtime to a larger audience  The emergence of mature ragtime is usually dated to 1897  the year in which several important early rags were published  In 1899  Scott Joplin s  Maple Leaf Rag  was published and became a great hit and demonstrated more depth and sophistication than earlier ragtime  Ragtime was one of the main influences on the early development of jazz  along with the blues   Some artists  such as Jelly Roll Morton  were present and performed both ragtime and jazz styles during the period the two genres overlapped  He also incorporated the Spanish Tinge in his performances  which gave a habanera or tango rhythm to his music  Jazz largely surpassed ragtime in mainstream popularity in the early 1920s  although ragtime compositions continue to be written up to the present  and periodic revivals of popular interest in ragtime occurred in the 1950s and the 1970s   The heyday of ragtime occurred before sound recording was widely available  Like classical music  and unlike jazz  classical ragtime had and has primarily a written tradition  being distributed in sheet music rather than through recordings or by imitation of live performances  Ragtime music was also distributed via piano rolls for player pianos  A folk ragtime tradition also existed before and during the period of classical ragtime  a designation largely created by Scott Joplin s publisher John Stillwell Stark   manifesting itself mostly through string bands  banjo and mandolin clubs  which experienced a burst of popularity during the early 20th century  and the like   A form known as novelty piano  or novelty ragtime  emerged as the traditional rag was fading in popularity  Where traditional ragtime depended on amateur pianists and sheet music sales  the novelty rag took advantage of new advances in piano roll technology and the phonograph record to permit a more complex  pyrotechnic  performance oriented style of rag to be heard  Chief among the novelty rag composers is Zez Confrey  whose  Kitten on the Keys  popularized the style in 1921   Ragtime also served as the roots for stride piano  a more improvisational piano style popular in the 1920s and 1930s  Elements of ragtime found their way into much of the American popular music of the early 20th century  It also played a central role in the development of the musical style later referred to as Piedmont blues  indeed  much of the music played by such artists of the genre as Reverend Gary Davis  Blind Boy Fuller  Elizabeth Cotten  and Etta Baker could be referred to as  ragtime guitar    Although most ragtime was composed for piano  transcriptions for other instruments and ensembles are common  notably including Gunther Schuller s arrangements of Joplin s rags  Ragtime guitar continued to be popular into the 1930s  usually in the form of songs accompanied by skilled guitar work  Numerous records emanated from several labels  performed by Blind Blake  Blind Boy Fuller  Lemon Jefferson  and others  Occasionally ragtime was scored for ensembles  particularly dance bands and brass bands  similar to those of James Reese Europe  or as songs like those written by Irving Berlin  Joplin had long standing ambitions of synthesizing the worlds of ragtime and opera  to which end the opera Treemonisha was written  However its first performance  poorly staged with Joplin accompanying on the piano  was  disastrous  and it was never to be fully performed again in Joplin s lifetime  In fact the score was lost for decades  then rediscovered in 1970  and a fully orchestrated and staged performance took place in 1972  An earlier opera by Joplin  A Guest of Honor  has been lost   2  Musical form  The rag was a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa  with additional polyrhythms coming from African music  It was usually written in 2 4 or 4 4 time with a predominant left hand pattern of bass notes on strong beats  beats 1 and 3  and chords on weak beats  beat 2 and 4  accompanying a syncopated melody in the right hand  According to some sources the name  ragtime  may come from the  ragged or syncopated rhythm  of the right hand  A rag written in 3 4 time is a  ragtime waltz    Ragtime is not a  time   meter  in the same sense that march time is 2 4 meter and waltz time is 3 4 meter  it is rather a musical genre that uses an effect that can be applied to any meter  The defining characteristic of ragtime music is a specific type of syncopation in which melodic accents occur between metrical beats  This results in a melody that seems to be avoiding some metrical beats of the accompaniment by emphasizing notes that either anticipate or follow the beat   a rhythmic base of metric affirmation  and a melody of metric denial    The ultimate  and intended  effect on the listener is actually to accentuate the beat  thereby inducing the listener to move to the music  Scott Joplin  the composer pianist known as the  King of Ragtime   called the effect  weird and intoxicating   He also used the term  swing  in describing how to play ragtime music   Play slowly until you catch the swing      The name swing later came to be applied to an early genre of jazz that developed from ragtime  Converting a non ragtime piece of music into ragtime by changing the time values of melody notes is known as  ragging  the piece  Original ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes  four being the most common number  These themes were typically 16 bars  each theme divided into periods of four four bar phrases and arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises  Typical patterns were AABBACCC′  AABBACCDD and AABBCCA  with the first two strains in the tonic key and the following strains in the subdominant  Sometimes rags would include introductions of four bars or bridges  between themes  of anywhere between four and 24 bars   3  Styles of ragtime  Ragtime pieces came in a number of different styles during the years of its popularity and appeared under a number of different descriptive names  It is related to several earlier styles of music  has close ties with later styles of music  and was associated with a few musical  fads  of the period such as the foxtrot  Many of the terms associated with ragtime have inexact definitions  and are defined differently by different experts  the definitions are muddled further by the fact that publishers often labelled pieces for the fad of the moment rather than the true style of the composition  There is even disagreement about the term  ragtime  itself  experts such as David Jasen and Trebor Tichenor choose to exclude ragtime songs from the definition but include novelty piano and stride piano  a modern perspective   while Edward A  Berlin includes ragtime songs and excludes the later styles  which is closer to how ragtime was viewed originally   The terms below should not be considered exact  but merely an attempt to pin down the general meaning of the concept   Cakewalk – a pre ragtime dance form popular until about 1904  The music is intended to be representative of an African American dance contest in which the prize is a cake  Many early rags are cakewalks   Characteristic march – a march incorporating idiomatic touches  such as syncopation  supposedly characteristic of the race of their subject  which is usually African Americans  Many early rags are characteristic marches   Two step – a pre ragtime dance form popular until about 1911  A large number of rags are two steps   Slow drag – another dance form associated with early ragtime  A modest number of rags are slow drags   Coon song – a pre ragtime vocal form popular until about 1901  A song with crude  racist lyrics often sung by white performers in blackface  Gradually died out in favor of the ragtime song  Strongly associated with ragtime in its day  it is one of the things that gave ragtime a bad name   Ragtime song – the vocal form of ragtime  more generic in theme than the coon song  Though this was the form of music most commonly considered  ragtime  in its day  many people today prefer to put it in the  popular music  category  Irving Berlin was the most commercially successful composer of ragtime songs  and his  Alexander s Ragtime Band   1911  was the single most widely performed and recorded piece of this sort  even though it contains virtually no ragtime syncopation  Gene Greene was a famous singer in this style   Folk ragtime – a name often used to describe ragtime that originated from small towns or assembled from folk strains  or at least sounded as if they did  Folk rags often have unusual chromatic features typical of composers with non standard training   Classic rag – a name used to describe the Missouri style ragtime popularized by Scott Joplin  James Scott  and others   Fox trot – a dance fad that began in 1913  Fox trots contain a dotted note rhythm different from that of ragtime  but which nonetheless was incorporated into many late rags   Novelty piano – a piano composition emphasizing speed and complexity  which emerged after World War I  It is almost exclusively the domain of white composers   Stride piano – a style of piano that emerged after World War I  developed by and dominated by black East coast pianists  James P  Johnson  Fats Waller and Willie  The Lion  Smith   Together with novelty piano  it may be considered a successor to ragtime  but is not considered by all to be  genuine  ragtime  Johnson composed the song that is arguably most associated with the Roaring Twenties   Charleston   A recording of Johnson playing the song appears on the compact disc James P  Johnson  Harlem Stride Piano  Jazz Archives No  111  EPM  Paris  1997   Johnson s recorded version has a ragtime flavor   4  American  pre 1940  ragtime composers  By far the most famous ragtime composer was Scott Joplin  Joseph Lamb and James Scott are  together with Joplin  acknowledged as the three most sophisticated ragtime composers  Other leading ragtime composers include Jelly Roll Morton  Eubie Blake  Charles L  Johnson  Tom Turpin  May Aufderheide  Mike Bernard  George Botsford  Zez Confrey  Ben Harney  Luckey Roberts  James P  Johnson  Paul Sarebresole  and Wilbur Sweatman   5  Influence on European composers  European Classical composers were influenced by the form  The first contact with ragtime was probably at the Paris Exposition in 1900  one of the stages of the European tour of John Philip Sousa  The first notable classical composer to take a serious interest in ragtime was Anton Dvoràk  French composer Claude Debussy emulated ragtime in three pieces for piano  The best known remains the Golliwog s Cake Walk  from the 1908 Piano Suite Children s Corner   He later returned to the style with two preludes for piano  Minstrels   1910  and General Lavine excentric  from his 1913 Preludes   which was inspired by a Médrano circus clown   Erik Satie  Arthur Honegger  Darius Milhaud and the other members of The Group of Six in Paris never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime  which is sometimes evident in their works  Consider  in particular  the ballet of Satie  Parade  Ragtime du Paquebot    1917  and La Mort de Monsieur Mouche  an overture for piano for a drama in three acts  composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J P  Contamine de Latour  In 1902 the American cakewalk was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags  La Diva de l empire and Piccadilly  Despite the two Anglo Saxon settings  the tracks appear American inspired  La Diva de l empire  a march for piano soloist  was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title Stand Walk Marche  it was later subtitled Intermezzo Americain when Rouarts Lerolle reprinted it in 1919  Piccadilly  another march  was initially titled The Transatlantique  it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route  going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe  There is a similar influence in Milhaud s ballets Le boeuf sur le toite and Creation du Monde  which he wrote after a trip to Harlem during his trip in 1922  Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious  Examples include Pacific 231  Prélude et Blues and especially the Concertino for piano and orchestra   Igor Stravinsky wrote a solo piano work called Piano Rag Music in 1919 and also included a rag in his theater piece L histoire du soldat  1918    Maurice Ravel is said to have heard Jimmie Noone and his group perform in Chicago  Despite the imprecise anecdote  Ravel s involvement with jazz is unquestionable  as it influenced many of his important works  for example the fox trot of L enfant et les sortilèges  the blues of the Sonata for violin and piano  Concerto in G and the Concerto for the left hand  both composed for piano in 1931   6  Ragtime revivals  In the early 1940s  many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire  and as early as 1936 78 rpm records of Joplin s compositions were produced  Old numbers written for piano were rescored for jazz instruments by jazz musicians  which gave the old style a new sound  The most famous recording of this period is Pee Wee Hunt s version of Euday L  Bowman s  Twelfth Street Rag    A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s  A wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records  and new rags were composed  published  and recorded  Much of the ragtime recorded in this period is presented in a light hearted novelty style  looked to with nostalgia as the product of a supposedly more innocent time  A number of popular recordings featured  prepared pianos   playing rags on pianos with tacks on the hammers and the instrument deliberately somewhat out of tune  supposedly to simulate the sound of a piano in an old honky tonk   Three events brought forward a different kind of ragtime revival in the 1970s  First  pianist Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin s work  Scott Joplin  Piano Rags  on Nonesuch Records  which was nominated for a Grammy in the  Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist s  without Orchestra  category in 1971  This recording reintroduced Joplin s music to the public in the manner the composer had intended  not as a nostalgic stereotype but as serious  respectable music  Second  the New York Public Library released a two volume set of  The Collected Works of Scott Joplin   which renewed interest in Joplin among musicians and prompted new stagings of Joplin s opera Treemonisha  Next came the release and Grammy Award for The New England Ragtime Ensemble s recording of Joplin s Red Back Book  Finally  with the release of the motion picture The Sting in 1973  which had a Marvin Hamlisch soundtrack of Joplin tunes originally edited by Gunther Schuller  ragtime was brought to a wide audience  Hamlisch s rendering of Joplin s 1902 rag  The Entertainer  won an Academy Award  and was an American Top 40 hit in 1974  reaching #3 on 18 May   Significant ragtime composers of the mid  to late 20th century include Max Morath  William Bolcom  Trebor Tichenor  David Thomas Roberts  and Reginald Robinson   In 1998  an adaption of E L  Doctorow s historic novel Ragtime was produced on Broadway  With music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens  the show featured several rags as well as songs in other musical genres   Many modern musicians have again begun to find ragtime  and incorporate it into their musical repertoires  Such acts include Jay Chou  Curtains for You  the not quite so young Baby Gramps and Bob Milne   7  Notes  8  References  9  Further reading  De Stefano  Gildo  Ragtime  jazz & dintorni  Preface by Amiri Baraka  SUGARCO Editions  Milan 2007  ISBN 978 88 7198 532 9  10
