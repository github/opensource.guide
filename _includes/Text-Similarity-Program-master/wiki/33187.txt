William Somerset Maugham CH     25 January 1874 – 16 December 1965  was a British playwright  novelist and short story writer  He was among the most popular writers of his era and reputedly the highest paid author during the 1930s   After losing both his parents by the age of 10  Maugham was raised by a paternal uncle who was emotionally cold  Not wanting to become a lawyer like other men in his family  Maugham eventually trained and qualified as a medical doctor  physician   The first run of his first novel  Liza of Lambeth  1897   sold out so rapidly that Maugham gave up medicine to write full time   During the First World War  he served with the Red Cross and in the ambulance corps  before being recruited in 1916 into the British Secret Intelligence Service  for which he worked in Switzerland and Russia before the October Revolution of 1917  During and after the war  he travelled in India and Southeast Asia  all of these experiences were reflected in later short stories and novels   1  Childhood and education  Maugham s father  Robert Ormond Maugham  was a lawyer who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris  Since French law declared that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service  his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy  technically on British soil  His grandfather  another Robert  had also been a prominent lawyer and co founder of the English Law Society  It was taken for granted that Maugham and his brothers would follow in their footsteps  His elder brother Viscount Maugham enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939   Maugham s mother  Edith Mary  née Snell   had tuberculosis  TB   a condition for which her medic prescribed childbirth  She had Maugham several years after the last of his three older brothers  they were already enrolled in boarding school by the time he was three  Being the youngest  he was effectively raised as an only child   Edith s sixth and final son died on 25 January 1882  one day after his birth  on Maugham s eighth birthday  Edith died of tuberculosis six days later on 31 January at the age of 41  The early death of his mother left Maugham traumatized  he kept his mother s photograph by his bedside for the rest of his life  Two years after Edith s death  Maugham s father died in France of cancer   Maugham was sent to the UK to be cared for by his uncle  Henry MacDonald Maugham  the Vicar of Whitstable  in Kent  The move was damaging  as Henry Maugham proved cold and emotionally cruel  The boy attended The King s School  Canterbury  which was also difficult for him  He was teased for his bad English  French had been his first language  and his short stature  which he inherited from his father  Maugham developed a stammer that would stay with him all his life  although it was sporadic and subject to mood and circumstance   Miserable both at his uncle s vicarage and at school  the young Maugham developed a talent for making wounding remarks to those who displeased him  This ability is sometimes reflected in Maugham s literary characters  At sixteen  Maugham refused to continue at The King s School  His uncle allowed him to travel to Germany  where he studied literature  philosophy and German at Heidelberg University  During his year in Heidelberg  Maugham met and had a sexual affair with John Ellingham Brooks  an Englishman ten years his senior  He also wrote his first book there  a biography of Giacomo Meyerbeer  an opera composer   On Maugham s return to Britain  his uncle found him a position in an accountant s office  but after a month  Maugham gave it up and returned to Whitstable  His uncle set about finding Maugham a new profession  Maugham s father and three older brothers were all distinguished lawyers  and Maugham asked to be excused from the duty of following in their footsteps  A career in the church was rejected because a stammering minister might make the family seem ridiculous  His uncle rejected the civil service  not because of the young man s feelings or interests  but because his uncle concluded that the civil service was no longer a career for gentlemen  a recent law required applicants to pass an entry examination  The local physician suggested the medical profession and Maugham s uncle agreed   Maugham had been writing steadily since the age of 15 and fervently wished to become an author  but as he was not of age  he refrained from telling his guardian  For the next five years  he studied medicine at St Thomas  Hospital in Lambeth  London   2  Career  2 1  Early works  Some critics have assumed that the years Maugham spent studying medicine were a creative dead end  but Maugham felt otherwise  He was living in the great city of London  meeting people of a  low  sort whom he would never have met otherwise  and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives  In maturity  he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student   I saw how men died  I saw how they bore pain  I saw what hope looked like  fear and relief       Maugham kept his own lodgings  took pleasure in furnishing them  filled many notebooks with literary ideas  and continued writing nightly while at the same time studying for his medical degree  In 1897  he wrote his second book  Liza of Lambeth  a tale of working class adultery and its consequences  It drew its details from Maugham s experiences as a medical student doing midwifery work in Lambeth  a South London slum  Maugham wrote near the opening of the novel       it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of the story  the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue    Liza of Lambeth s first print run sold out in a matter of weeks  Maugham  who had qualified as a medic  dropped medicine and embarked on his 65 year career as a man of letters  He later said   I took to it as a duck takes to water    The writer s life allowed Maugham to travel and to live in places such as Spain and Capri for the next decade  but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza  This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick  By the next year  he had four plays running simultaneously in London  and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards   Maugham s supernatural thriller  The Magician  1908   based its principal character on the well known and somewhat disreputable Aleister Crowley  Crowley took some offence at the treatment of the protagonist  Oliver Haddo  He wrote a critique of the novel  charging Maugham with plagiarism  in a review published in Vanity Fair  Maugham survived the criticism without much damage to his reputation   2 2  Popular success  1914–39  By 1914  Maugham was famous  with 10 plays produced and 10 novels published  Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out  he served in France as a member of the British Red Cross s so called  Literary Ambulance Drivers   a group of some 24 well known writers  including the Americans John Dos Passos and E  E  Cummings   During this time  he met Frederick Gerald Haxton  a young San Franciscan  who became his companion and lover until Haxton s death in 1944  Throughout this period  Maugham continued to write  He proofread Of Human Bondage at a location near Dunkirk during a lull in his ambulance duties   Of Human Bondage  1915  initially was criticized in both England and the United States  the New York World described the romantic obsession of the protagonist Philip Carey as  the sentimental servitude of a poor fool   The influential American novelist and critic Theodore Dreiser rescued the novel  referring to it as a work of genius and comparing it to a Beethoven symphony  His review gave the book a lift  and it has never been out of print since   Maugham indicates in his foreword that he derived the title from a passage in Baruch Spinoza s Ethics   Of Human Bondage is considered to have many autobiographical elements  Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot  rather than his stammer   the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable  and Carey is a medic  Maugham insisted the book was more invention than fact  The close relationship between fictional and non fictional became Maugham s trademark  despite the legal requirement to state that  the characters in  this or that publication  are entirely imaginary   In 1938 he wrote   Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now  looking back on it  I can hardly distinguish one from the other    3  Marriage and family  Although homosexual  Maugham entered into a relationship with Syrie Wellcome  the wife of Henry Wellcome  an American born English pharmaceutical magnate  They had a daughter named Mary Elizabeth Maugham   1915–1998   Henry Wellcome sued his wife for divorce  naming Maugham as co respondent   In May 1917  following the decree absolute  Syrie Wellcome and Maugham were married  Syrie Maugham became a noted interior decorator who in the 1920s popularized  the all white room   Their daughter was familiarly called Liza and her surname was changed to Maugham   The marriage was unhappy  and Syrie divorced him in 1929  finding his relationship and travels with Haxton too difficult to live with   4  Intelligence work  Maugham returned to England from his ambulance unit duties to promote Of Human Bondage  With that completed  he was eager to assist the war effort again  As he was unable to return to his ambulance unit  Syrie arranged for him to be introduced to a high ranking intelligence officer known as  R   he was recruited by John Wallinger  In September 1915  Maugham began work in Switzerland  as one of the network of British agents who operated against the Berlin Committee  whose members included Virendranath Chattopadhyay  an Indian revolutionary trying to use the war to create violence against the British in his country  Maugham lived in Switzerland as a writer   In 1916  Maugham travelled to the Pacific to research his novel The Moon and Sixpence  based on the life of Paul Gauguin  This was the first of his journeys through the late Imperial world of the 1920s and 1930s which inspired his novels  He became known as a writer who portrayed the last days of colonialism in India  Southeast Asia  China and the Pacific  although the books on which this reputation rests represent only a fraction of his output  On this and all subsequent journeys  he was accompanied by Haxton  whom he regarded as indispensable to his success as a writer  Maugham was painfully shy  and Haxton the extrovert gathered human material which the author converted to fiction   In June 1917  Maugham was asked by Sir William Wiseman  an officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service  later named MI6   to undertake a special mission in Russia  It was part of an attempt to keep the Provisional Government in power and Russia in the war by countering German pacifist propaganda  Two and a half months later  the Bolsheviks took control  Maugham subsequently said that if he had been able to get there six months earlier  he might have succeeded  Quiet and observant  Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work  he believed he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgement and the ability to be undeceived by facile appearances   Maugham used his spying experiences as the basis for Ashenden  Or the British Agent  a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly  sophisticated  aloof spy  This character is considered to have influenced Ian Fleming s later series of James Bond novels  In 1922  Maugham dedicated his book On A Chinese Screen to Syrie  This was a collection of 58 ultra short story sketches  which he had written during his 1920 travels through China and Hong Kong  intending to expand the sketches later as a book   Dramatised from a story first published in his collection The Casuarina Tree  1924   Maugham s play The Letter  starring Gladys Cooper  had its premiere in London in 1927  Later  he asked that Katharine Cornell play the lead in the 1927 Broadway version  The play was adapted as a film by the same name in 1929  and again in 1940  for which Bette Davis received an Oscar nomination  In 1951  Cornell was a great success playing the lead in his comedy  The Constant Wife   In 1926  Maugham bought Villa Mauresque  on 9 acres  3 6 hectares  at Cap Ferrat on the French Riviera and it was his home for most of the rest of his life  There he hosted one of the great literary and social salons of the 1920s and 30s  He continued to be highly productive  writing plays  short stories  novels  essays and travel books  By 1940  when the collapse of France and its occupation by the German Third Reich forced Maugham to leave the French Riviera  he was a refugee – but one of the wealthiest and most famous writers in the English speaking world   Maugham s novel  An Appointment in Samarra  1933   is based on an ancient Babylonian myth  Death is both the narrator and a central character  The American writer John O Hara credited Maugham s novel as a creative inspiration for his own novel Appointment in Samarra   5  Grand old man of letters  Maugham  by then in his sixties  spent most of the Second World War in the United States  first in Hollywood  he worked on many scripts  and was one of the first authors to make significant money from film adaptations  and later in the South  While in the US  he was asked by the British government to make patriotic speeches to induce the US to aid Britain  if not necessarily become an allied combatant  After his companion Gerald Haxton died in 1944  Maugham moved back to England  In 1946 he returned to his villa in France  where he lived  interrupted by frequent and long travels  until his death   Maugham began a relationship with Alan Searle  whom he had first met in 1928  A young man from the London slum area of Bermondsey  Searle had already been kept by older men  He proved a devoted if not a stimulating companion  One of Maugham s friends  describing the difference between Haxton and Searle  said simply   Gerald was vintage  Alan was vin ordinaire    Maugham s love life was almost never smooth  He once confessed   I have most loved people who cared little or nothing for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed     In order not to hurt their feelings  I have often acted a passion I did not feel    In 1962 Maugham sold a collection of paintings  some of which had already been assigned to his daughter Liza by deed  She sued her father and won a judgment of £230 000  Maugham publicly disowned her and claimed she was not his biological daughter  He adopted Searle as his son and heir  In his 1962 volume of memoirs  Looking Back  he attacked the late Syrie Maugham and wrote that Liza had been born before they married  The memoir cost him several friends and exposed him to much public ridicule  Liza and her husband Lord Glendevon contested the change in Maugham s will in the French courts  and it was overturned  But  in 1965 Searle inherited £50 000  the contents of Villa Mauresque  Maugham s manuscripts and his revenue from copyrights for 30 years  Thereafter the copyrights passed to the Royal Literary Fund   There is no grave for Maugham  His ashes were scattered near the Maugham Library  The King s School  Canterbury  Liza Maugham  Lady Glendevon  died aged 83 in 1998  survived by her four children  a son and a daughter by her first marriage to Vincent Paravicini  and two more sons to Lord Glendevon   One of her grandchildren is Derek Paravicini  who is a musical prodigy and autistic savant   6  Achievements  Commercial success with high book sales  successful theatre productions and a string of film adaptations  backed by astute stock market investments  allowed Maugham to live a very comfortable life  Small and weak as a boy  Maugham had been proud even then of his stamina  and as an adult he kept churning out the books  proud that he could  Yet  despite his triumphs  he never attracted the highest respect from the critics or his peers  Maugham attributed this to his lack of  lyrical quality   his small vocabulary  and failure to make expert use of metaphor in his work  In 1934 the American journalist and radio personality Alexander Woollcott offered Maugham some language advice   The female implies  and from that the male infers   Maugham responded   I am not yet too old to learn    Maugham wrote at a time when experimental modernist literature such as that of William Faulkner  Thomas Mann  James Joyce and Virginia Woolf was gaining increasing popularity and winning critical acclaim  In this context  his plain prose style was criticized as  such a tissue of clichés that one s wonder is finally aroused at the writer s ability to assemble so many and at his unfailing inability to put anything in an individual way    For a public man of Maugham s generation  being openly gay was impossible  Whether his own orientation disgusted him  as it did many at a time when homosexuality was widely considered a moral failing as well as illegal  or whether he was trying to disguise his leanings  Maugham wrote disparagingly of the gay artist  In Don Fernando  a non fiction book about his years living in Spain  Maugham pondered a  perhaps fanciful  suggestion that the painter El Greco was homosexual    It cannot be denied that the homosexual has a narrower outlook on the world than the normal man  In certain respects the natural responses of the species are denied to him  Some at least of the broad and typical human emotions he can never experience  However subtly he sees life he cannot see it whole     I cannot now help asking myself whether what I see in El Greco s work of tortured fantasy and sinister strangeness is not due to such a sexual abnormality as this   But Maugham s homosexuality or bisexuality is believed to have shaped his fiction in two ways  Since he tended to see attractive women as sexual rivals  he often gave his women characters sexual needs and appetites  in a way quite unusual for authors of his time  Liza of Lambeth  Cakes and Ale  Neil MacAdam and The Razor s Edge  all featured women determined to feed their strong sexual appetites  heedless of the result  As Maugham s sexual appetites were then officially disapproved of  or criminal  in nearly all of the countries in which he travelled  the author was unusually tolerant of the vices of others  Some readers and critics complained that Maugham did not condemn what was bad in the villains of his fiction and plays  Maugham replied   It must be a fault in me that I am not gravely shocked at the sins of others unless they personally affect me    Maugham s public view of his abilities remained modest  Toward the end of his career he described himself as  in the very first row of the second raters   In 1948 he wrote  Great Novelists and Their Novels  in which he listed the ten best novels of world literature in his view  In 1954  he was made a Companion of Honour   Maugham had begun collecting theatrical paintings before the First World War  he continued to the point where his collection was second only to that of the Garrick Club  In 1948 he announced that he would bequeath this collection to the Trustees of the National Theatre  From 1951  some 14 years before his death  his paintings began their exhibition life  In 1994 they were placed on loan to the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden   7  Significant works  Maugham s masterpiece is generally agreed to be Of Human Bondage  a semiautobiographical novel that deals with the life of the main character Philip Carey  who  like Maugham  was orphaned  and brought up by his pious uncle  Philip s clubfoot causes him endless self consciousness and embarrassment  echoing Maugham s struggles with his stutter and  as his biographer Ted Morgan notes  his homosexuality   Two of his later novels were based on historical people  The Moon and Sixpence is about the life of Paul Gauguin  and Cakes and Ale contains what were taken as thinly veiled and unflattering characterizations of the authors Thomas Hardy  who had died two years previously  and Hugh Walpole  Maugham himself denied any intention of doing this in a long letter to Walpole   I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you  He is made up of a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself   Maugham s last major novel  The Razor s Edge  1944   was a departure for him in many ways  While much of the novel takes place in Europe  its main characters are American  not British  The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of the First World War who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle  traveling to India seeking enlightenment  The story s themes of Eastern mysticism and war weariness struck a chord with readers during the Second World War  It was adapted into a major motion picture released in 1946   Among his short stories  some of the most memorable are those dealing with the lives of Western  mostly British  colonists in the Far East  They typically express the emotional toll the colonists bear by their isolation   Rain    Footprints in the Jungle   and  The Outstation  are considered especially notable   Rain   in particular  which charts the moral disintegration of a missionary attempting to convert the Pacific island prostitute Sadie Thompson  has kept its reputation  It has been adapted as a play and as several films  His The Magician  1908  is based on British occultist Aleister Crowley   Maugham was one of the most significant travel writers of the inter war years  and can be compared with contemporaries such as Evelyn Waugh and Freya Stark  His best efforts in this line include The Gentleman in the Parlour  dealing with a journey through Burma  Siam  Cambodia and Vietnam  and On a Chinese Screen  a series of very brief vignettes that might have been sketches for stories left unwritten   8  Influence  In 1947 Maugham instituted the Somerset Maugham Award  awarded to the best British writer or writers under the age of thirty five for a work of fiction published in the past year  Notable winners include V  S  Naipaul  Kingsley Amis  Martin Amis and Thom Gunn  On his death  Maugham donated his royalties to the Royal Literary Fund   Other writers acknowledged his work  Anthony Burgess  who included a complex fictional portrait of Maugham in the novel Earthly Powers  praised his influence  Ian Fleming noted that he wrote the short story Quantum of Solace as an homage to Maugham s writing style  George Orwell said that Maugham was  the modern writer who has influenced me the most  whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills    9  Portraits of Maugham  Many portraits were painted of Somerset Maugham  including that by Graham Sutherland in the Tate Gallery  and several by Sir Gerald Kelly  Sutherland s portrait was included in the exhibit Painting the Century  101 Portrait Masterpieces 1900–2000 at the National Portrait Gallery   10
