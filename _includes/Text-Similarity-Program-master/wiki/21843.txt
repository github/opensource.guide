A nucleosome is a basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes  consisting of a segment of DNA wound in sequence around eight histone protein cores  This structure is often compared to thread wrapped around a spool   Nucleosomes form the fundamental repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin  which is used to pack the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus while still ensuring appropriate access to it  in mammalian cells approximately 2 m of linear DNA have to be packed into a nucleus of roughly 10 µm diameter   Nucleosomes are folded through a series of successively higher order structures to eventually form a chromosome  this both compacts DNA and creates an added layer of regulatory control  which ensures correct gene expression  Nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information in the form of covalent modifications of their core histones  Nucleosomes were observed as particles in the electron microscope by Don and Ada Olins and their existence and structure  as histone octamers surrounded by approximately 200 base pairs of DNA  were proposed by Roger Kornberg  The role of the nucleosome as a general gene repressor was demonstrated by Lorch et al  in vitro and by Han and Grunstein in vivo   The nucleosome core particle consists of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped in 1 67 left handed superhelical turns around a histone octamer consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A  H2B  H3  and H4  Core particles are connected by stretches of  linker DNA   which can be up to about 80 bp long  Technically  a nucleosome is defined as the core particle plus one of these linker regions  however the word is often synonymous with the core particle  Genome wide nucleosome positioning maps are now available for many model organisms including mouse liver and brain   Linker histones such as H1 and its isoforms are involved in chromatin compaction and sit at the base of the nucleosome near the DNA entry and exit binding to the linker region of the DNA  Non condensed nucleosomes without the linker histone resemble  beads on a string of DNA  under an electron microscope   In contrast to most eukaryotic cells  mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA  most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio  Histone equivalents and a simplified chromatin structure have also been found in Archea  suggesting that eukaryotes are not the only organisms that use nucleosomes   1  Structure  1 1  Structure of the core particle  1 1 1  Overview  Pioneering structural studies in the 1980s by Aaron Klug s group provided the first evidence that an octamer of histone proteins wraps DNA around itself in about two turns of a left handed superhelix  In 1997 the first near atomic resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome was solved by the Richmond group  showing the most important details of the particle  The human alpha satellite palindromic DNA critical to achieving the 1997 nucleosome crystal structure was developed by the Bunick group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee  The structures of over 20 different nucleosome core particles have been solved to date  including those containing histone variants and histones from different species  The structure of the nucleosome core particle is remarkably conserved  and even a change of over 100 residues between frog and yeast histones results in electron density maps with an overall root mean square deviation of only 1 6Å   1 1 2  The nucleosome core particle  The nucleosome core particle  shown in the figure  consists of about 146 bp of DNA wrapped in 1 67 left handed superhelical turns around the histone octamer  consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A  H2B  H3  and H4  Adjacent nucleosomes are joined by a stretch of free DNA termed  linker DNA   which varies from 10   80 bp in length depending on species and tissue type    Nucleosome core particles are observed when chromatin in interphase is treated to cause the chromatin to unfold partially  The resulting image  via an electron microscope  is  beads on a string   The string is the DNA  while each bead in the nucleosome is a core particle  The nucleosome core particle is composed of DNA and histone proteins   Partial DNAse digestion of chromatin reveals its nucleosome structure  Because DNA portions of nucleosome core particles are less accessible for DNAse than linking sections  DNA gets digested into fragments of lengths equal to multiplicity of distance between nucleosomes  180  360  540 base pairs etc    Hence very characteristic pattern similar to ladder is visible during gel electrophoresis of that DNA  Such digestion can occur also under natural conditions during apoptosis   cell suicide  or programmed cell death   because autodestruction of DNA typically is its part   1 1 2 1  Protein interactions within the nucleosome  The core histone proteins contain a characteristic structural motif termed the  histone fold   which consists of three alpha helices  α1 3  separated by two loops  L1 2   In solution  the histones form H2A H2B heterodimers and H3 H4 heterotetramers  Histones dimerise about their long α2 helices in an anti parallel orientation  and  in the case of H3 and H4  two such dimers form a 4 helix bundle stabilised by extensive H3 H3’ interaction  The H2A H2B dimer binds onto the H3 H4 tetramer due to interactions between H4 and H2B  which include the formation of a hydrophobic cluster  The histone octamer is formed by a central H3 H4 tetramer sandwiched between two H2A H2B dimers  Due to the highly basic charge of all four core histones  the histone octamer is stable only in the presence of DNA or very high salt concentrations   1 1 2 2  Histone   DNA interactions  The nucleosome contains over 120 direct protein DNA interactions and several hundred water mediated ones  Direct protein   DNA interactions are not spread evenly about the octamer surface but rather located at discrete sites  These are due to the formation of two types of DNA binding sites within the octamer  the α1α1 site  which uses the α1 helix from two adjacent histones  and the L1L2 site formed by the L1 and L2 loops  Salt links and hydrogen bonding between both side chain basic and hydroxyl groups and main chain amides with the DNA backbone phosphates form the bulk of interactions with the DNA  This is important  given that the ubiquitous distribution of nucleosomes along genomes requires it to be a non sequence specific DNA binding factor  Although nucleosomes tend to prefer some DNA sequences over others  they are capable of binding practically to any sequence  which is thought to be due to the flexibility in the formation of these water mediated interactions  In addition  non polar interactions are made between protein side chains and the deoxyribose groups  and an arginine side chain intercalates into the DNA minor groove at all 14 sites where it faces the octamer surface  The distribution and strength of DNA binding sites about the octamer surface distorts the DNA within the nucleosome core  The DNA is non uniformly bent and also contains twist defects  The twist of free B form DNA in solution is 10 5 bp per turn  However  the overall twist of nucleosomal DNA is only 10 2 bp per turn  varying from a value of 9 4 to 10 9 bp per turn   1 1 3  Histone tail domains  The histone tail extensions constitute up to 30% by mass of histones  but are not visible in the crystal structures of nucleosomes due to their high intrinsic flexibility  and have been thought to be largely unstructured  The N terminal tails of histones H3 and H2B pass through a channel formed by the minor grooves of the two DNA strands  protruding from the DNA every 20 bp  The N terminal tail of histone H4  on the other hand  has a region of highly basic amino acids  16 25   which  in the crystal structure  forms an interaction with the highly acidic surface region of a H2A H2B dimer of another nucleosome  being potentially relevant for the higher order structure of nucleosomes  This interaction is thought to occur under physiological conditions also  and suggests that acetylation of the H4 tail distorts the higher order structure of chromatin   1 2  Higher order structure  The organization of the DNA that is achieved by the nucleosome cannot fully explain the packaging of DNA observed in the cell nucleus  Further compaction of chromatin into the cell nucleus is necessary  but is not yet well understood  The current understanding is that repeating nucleosomes with intervening  linker  DNA form a 10 nm fiber  described as  beads on a string   and have a packing ratio of about five to ten  A chain of nucleosomes can be arranged in a 30 nm fiber  a compacted structure with a packing ratio of ~50 and whose formation is dependent on the presence of the H1 histone   A crystal structure of a tetranucleosome has been presented and used to build up a proposed structure of the 30 nm fiber as a two start helix  There is still a certain amount of contention regarding this model  as it is incompatible with recent electron microscopy data  Beyond this  the structure of chromatin is poorly understood  but it is classically suggested that the 30 nm fiber is arranged into loops along a central protein scaffold to form transcriptionally active euchromatin  Further compaction leads to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin   2  Nucleosome dynamics  Although the nucleosome is a very stable protein DNA complex  it is not static and has been shown to undergo a number of different structural re arrangements including nucleosome sliding and DNA site exposure  Depending on the context  nucleosomes can inhibit or facilitate transcription factor binding  Nucleosome positions are controlled by three major contributions  First  the intrinsic binding affinity of the histone octamer depends on the DNA sequence  Second  the nucleosome can be displaced or recruited by the competitive or cooperative binding of other protein factors  Third  the nucleosome may be actively translocated by ATP dependent remodeling complexes   2 1  Nucleosome sliding  Work performed in the Bradbury laboratory showed that nucleosomes reconstituted onto the 5S DNA positioning sequence were able to reposition themselves translationally onto adjacent sequences when incubated thermally  Later work showed that this repositioning did not require disruption of the histone octamer but was consistent with nucleosomes being able to “slide” along the DNA in cis  In 2008  It was further revealed that CTCF binding sites act as nucleosome positioning anchors so that  when used to align various genomic signals  multiple flanking nucleosomes can be readily identified  Although nucleosomes are intrinsically mobile  eukaryotes have evolved a large family of ATP dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes to alter chromatin structure  many of which do so via nucleosome sliding  In 2012  Beena Pillai s laboratory has demonstrated that nucleosome sliding is one of the possible mechanism for large scale tissue specific expression of genes  The work shows that the transcription start site for genes expressed in a particular tissue  are nucleosome depleted while  the same set of genes in other tissue where they are not expressed  are nucleosome bound   2 2  DNA site exposure  Work from the Widom laboratory has shown that nucleosomal DNA is in equilibrium between a wrapped and unwrapped state  Measurements of these rates using time resolved FRET revealed that DNA within the nucleosome remains fully wrapped for only 250 ms before it is unwrapped for 10 50 ms and then rapidly rewrapped  This implies that DNA does not need to be actively dissociated from the nucleosome but that there is a significant fraction of time during which it is fully accessible  Indeed  this can be extended to the observation that introducing a DNA binding sequence within the nucleosome increases the accessibility of adjacent regions of DNA when bound  This propensity for DNA within the nucleosome to “breathe” is predicted to have important functional consequences for all DNA binding proteins that operate in a chromatin environment   3  Modulating nucleosome structure  Eukaryotic genomes are ubiquitously associated into chromatin  however  cells must spatially and temporally regulate specific loci independently of bulk chromatin  In order to achieve the high level of control required to co ordinate nuclear processes such as DNA replication  repair  and transcription  cells have developed a variety of means to locally and specifically modulate chromatin structure and function  This can involve covalent modification of histones  the incorporation of histone variants  and non covalent remodelling by ATP dependent remodeling enzymes   3 1  Histone post translational modifications  Since they were discovered in the mid 1960s  histone modifications have been predicted to affect transcription  The fact that most of the early post translational modifications found were concentrated within the tail extensions that protrude from the nucleosome core lead to two main theories regarding the mechanism of histone modification  The first of the theories suggested that they may affect electrostatic interactions between the histone tails and DNA to “loosen” chromatin structure  Later it was proposed that combinations of these modifications may create binding epitopes with which to recruit other proteins  Recently  given that more modifications have been found in the structured regions of histones  it has been put forward that these modifications may affect histone DNA and histone histone interactions within the nucleosome core  Modifications  such as acetylation or phosphorylation  that lower the charge of the globular histone core are predicted to  loosen  core DNA association  the strength of the effect depends on location of the modification within the core  Some modifications have been shown to be correlated with gene silencing  others seem to be correlated with gene activation  Common modifications include acetylation  methylation  or ubiquitination of lysine  methylation of arginine  and phosphorylation of serine  The information stored in this way is considered epigenetic  since it is not encoded in the DNA but is still inherited to daughter cells  The maintenance of a repressed or activated status of a gene is often necessary for cellular differentiation   3 2  Histone variants  Although histones are remarkably conserved throughout evolution  several variant forms have been identified  It is interesting to note that this diversification of histone function is restricted to H2A and H3  with H2B and H4 being mostly invariant  H2A can be replaced by H2AZ  which leads to reduced nucleosome stability  or H2AX  which is associated with DNA repair and T cell differentiation   whereas the inactive X chromosomes in mammals are enriched in macroH2A  H3 can be replaced by H3 3  which correlates with activate genes and regulatory elements  and in centromeres H3 is replaced by CENPA   3 3  ATP dependent nucleosome remodeling  A number of distinct reactions are associated with the term ATP dependent chromatin remodeling  Remodeling enzymes have been shown to slide nucleosomes along DNA  disrupt histone DNA contacts to the extent of destabilising the H2A H2B dimer and to generate negative superhelical torsion in DNA and chromatin  Recently  the Swr1 remodeling enzyme has been shown to introduce the variant histone H2A Z into nucleosomes  At present  it is not clear if all of these represent distinct reactions or merely alternative outcomes of a common mechanism  What is shared between all  and indeed the hallmark of ATP dependent chromatin remodeling  is that they all result in altered DNA accessibility  Studies looking at gene activation in vivo and  more astonishingly  remodelling in vitro have revealed that chromatin remodeling events and transcription factor binding are cyclical and periodic in nature  While the consequences of this for the reaction mechanism of chromatin remodeling are not known  the dynamic nature of the system may allow it to respond faster to external stimuli  A recent study indicates that nucleosome positions change significantly during mouse embryonic stem cell development  and these changes are related to binding of developmental transcription factors   3 4  Dynamic nucleosome remodelling across the Yeast genome  Studies in 2007 have catalogued nucleosome positions in yeast and shown that nucleosomes are depleted in promoter regions and origins of replication  About 80% of the yeast genome appears to be covered by nucleosomes and the pattern of nucleosome positioning clearly relates to DNA regions that regulate transcription  regions that are transcribed and regions that initiate DNA replication  Most recently  a new study examined ‘’dynamic changes’’ in nucleosome repositioning during a global transcriptional reprogramming event to elucidate the effects on nucleosome displacement during genome wide transcriptional changes in yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae   The results suggested that nucleosomes that were localized to promoter regions are displaced in response to stress  like heat shock   In addition  the removal of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional activation and the replacement of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional repression  presumably because transcription factor binding sites became more or less accessible  respectively  In general  only one or two nucleosomes were repositioned at the promoter to effect these transcriptional changes  However  even in chromosomal regions that were not associated with transcriptional changes  nucleosome repositioning was observed  suggesting that the covering and uncovering of transcriptional DNA does not necessarily produce a transcriptional event   4  Nucleosome assembly in vitro  Nucleosomes can be assembled in vitro by either using purified native or recombinant histones  One standard technique of loading the DNA around the histones involves the use of salt dialysis  A reaction consisting of the histone octamers and a naked DNA template can be incubated together at a salt concentration of 2 M  By steadily decreasing the salt concentration  the DNA will equilibrate to a position where it is wrapped around the histone octamers  forming nucleosomes  In appropriate conditions  this reconstitution process allows for the nucleosome positioning affinity of a given sequence to be mapped experimentally   5
