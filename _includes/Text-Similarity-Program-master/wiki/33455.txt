A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP  the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web  The term can refer either to the entire system  or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests   The most common use of web servers is to host websites  but there are other uses such as gaming  data storage  running enterprise applications  handling email  FTP  or other web uses   1  Overview  The primary function of a web server is to store  process and deliver web pages to clients  The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents  which may include images  style sheets and scripts in addition to text content   A user agent  commonly a web browser or web crawler  initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so  The resource is typically a real file on the server s secondary storage  but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented   While the primary function is to serve content  a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients  This feature is used for submitting web forms  including uploading of files   Many generic web servers also support server side scripting using Active Server Pages  ASP   PHP  or other scripting languages  This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files  while the actual server software remains unchanged  Usually  this function is used to generate HTML documents dynamically   on the fly   as opposed to returning static documents  The former is primarily used for retrieving and or modifying information from databases  The latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content   Web servers are not always used for serving the World Wide Web  They can also be found embedded in devices such as printers  routers  webcams and serving only a local network  The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring and or administering the device in question  This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer  since only a web browser is required  which now is included with most operating systems    2  History  In 1989 Tim Berners Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN  with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system  The project resulted in Berners Lee writing two programs in 1990   A browser called WorldWideWeb   The world s first web server  later known as CERN httpd  which ran on NeXTSTEP Between 1991 and 1994  the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the World Wide Web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among scientific organizations and universities  and then to industry   In 1994 Tim Berners Lee decided to constitute the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  to regulate the further development of the many technologies involved  HTTP  HTML  etc   through a standardization process   3  Common features  Virtual hosting to serve many web sites using one IP address  Large file support to be able to serve files whose size is greater than 2 GB on 32 bit OS  Bandwidth throttling to limit the speed of responses in order to not saturate the network and to be able to serve more clients  Server side scripting to generate dynamic web pages  still keeping web server and website implementations separate from each other  4  Path translation  Web servers are able to map the path component of a Uniform Resource Locator  URL  into   A local file system resource  for static requests   An internal or external program name  for dynamic requests  For a static request the URL path specified by the client is relative to the web server s root directory   Consider the following URL as it would be requested by a client   The client s user agent will translate it into a connection to with the following HTTP 1 1 request   The web server on will append the given path to the path of its root directory  On an Apache server  this is commonly  home www  On Unix machines  usually  var www   The result is the local file system resource   The web server then reads the file  if it exists and sends a response to the client s web browser  The response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable   5  Kernel mode and user mode web servers  A web server can be either implemented into the OS kernel  or in user space  like other regular applications    An in kernel web server  like Microsoft IIS on Windows or TUX on GNU Linux  will usually work faster  because  as part of the system  it can directly use all the hardware resources it needs  such as non paged memory  CPU time slices  network adapters  or buffers   Web servers that run in user mode have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more CPU resources  Not only do these requests to the kernel take time  but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications  Executing in user mode can also mean useless buffer copies which are another handicap for user mode web servers   6  Load limits  A web server  program  has defined load limits  because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections  usually between 2 and 80 000  by default between 500 and 1 000  per IP address  and TCP port  and it can serve only a certain maximum number of requests per second depending on   its own settings   the HTTP request type   whether the content is static or dynamic   whether the content is cached  and  the hardware and software limitations of the OS of the computer on which the web server runs  When a web server is near to or over its limit  it becomes unresponsive   6 1  Causes of overload  At any time web servers can be overloaded because of   Too much legitimate web traffic  Thousands or even millions of clients connecting to the web site in a short interval  e g   Slashdot effect   Distributed Denial of Service attacks  A denial of service attack  DoS attack  or distributed denial of service attack  DDoS attack  is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users   Computer worms that sometimes cause abnormal traffic because of millions of infected computers  not coordinated among them    XSS viruses can cause high traffic because of millions of infected browsers and or web servers   Internet bots Traffic not filtered limited on large web sites with very few resources  bandwidth  etc     Internet  network  slowdowns  so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached   Web servers  computers  partial unavailability  This can happen because of required or urgent maintenance or upgrade  hardware or software failures  back end  e g   database  failures  etc   in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and become overloaded   6 2  Symptoms of overload  The symptoms of an overloaded web server are   Requests are served with  possibly long  delays  from 1 second to a few hundred seconds    The web server returns an HTTP error code  such as 500  502  503  504  408  or even 404  which is inappropriate for an overload condition   The web server refuses or resets  interrupts  TCP connections before it returns any content   In very rare cases  the web server returns only a part of the requested content  This behavior can be considered a bug  even if it usually arises as a symptom of overload   6 3  Anti overload techniques  To partially overcome above average load limits and to prevent overload  most popular web sites use common techniques like   Managing network traffic  by using   Firewalls to block unwanted traffic coming from bad IP sources or having bad patterns  HTTP traffic managers to drop  redirect or rewrite requests having bad HTTP patterns  Bandwidth management and traffic shaping  in order to smooth down peaks in network usage  Deploying web cache techniques  Using different domain names to serve different  static and dynamic  content by separate web servers  i e    Using different domain names and or computers to separate big files from small and medium sized files  the idea is to be able to fully cache small and medium sized files and to efficiently serve big or huge  over 10   1000 MB  files by using different settings  Using many web servers  programs  per computer  each one bound to its own network card and IP address  Using many web servers  computers  that are grouped together behind a load balancer so that they act or are seen as one big web server  Adding more hardware resources  i e  RAM  disks  to each computer  Tuning OS parameters for hardware capabilities and usage  Using more efficient computer programs for web servers  etc   Using other workarounds  especially if dynamic content is involved  7  Market share  Below are the latest statistics of the market share of the top web servers on the Internet by Netcraft    Apache  IIS and Nginx are the most used web servers on the Internet
