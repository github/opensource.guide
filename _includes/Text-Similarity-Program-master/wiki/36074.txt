To help compare different orders of magnitude this page lists some items with lengths between 10−6 and 10−5 m (between 1 and 10 micrometres, or µm).

Distances shorter than 1 µm

~0.7–300 µm — Wavelength of infrared radiation

1 µm — the side of square of area 10−12 m²

1 µm — edge of cube of volume 10−18 m³ (one fL.)

1–10 µm — diameter of a typical bacterium

1.55 µm — wavelength of light used in optical fibre

3–4 µm — size of a typical yeast cell

5 µm — length of a typical human spermatozoon's head

6 µm — anthrax spore

7 µm — diameter of the nucleus of a typical eukaryotic cell

about 7 μm — diameter of human red blood cells

3–8 µm — width of strand of spider web silk

8 µm — width of a chloroplast

9 µm — thickness of the tape in a 120-minute compact cassette.

about 10 µm — size of a fog, mist or cloud water droplet Distances longer than 10 µm
