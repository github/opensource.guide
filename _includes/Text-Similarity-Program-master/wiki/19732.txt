Mage  The Ascension is a role playing game based in the World of Darkness  and was published by White Wolf Game Studio  The characters portrayed in the game are referred to as mages  and are capable of feats of magic  The idea of magic in Mage is broadly inclusive of diverse ideas about mystical practices as well as other belief systems  such as science and religion  so that most mages do not resemble typical fantasy wizards   In 2005  White Wolf released a new version of the game  marketed as Mage  The Awakening  for the new World of Darkness series  The new game features some of the same game mechanics but uses a substantially different premise and setting   1  History  Following the release of Vampire  The Masquerade  White Wolf put out a new roleplaying game every year  each set in Vampire s World of Darkness and using its Storyteller rule system  The next four games were  Werewolf  The Apocalypse  1992   Mage  The Ascension  1993   Wraith  The Oblivion  1994  and Changeling  The Dreaming  1995   Mage was the first World of Darkness game that Mark Rein•Hagen was not explicitly involved with  although it featured the Order of Hermes from his Ars Magica as just a single tradition among many   2  Metaphysics  The basic premise of Mage  The Ascension is that everyone has the capacity  at some level  to shape reality  This capacity  personified as a mysterious alter ego called the Avatar  is dormant in most people  who are known as sleepers  whereas Magi  and or their Avatars  are said to be Awakened  Because they re awakened  Magi can consciously effect changes to reality via willpower  beliefs  and specific magical techniques   The beliefs and techniques of Magi vary enormously  and the ability to alter reality can only exist in the context of a coherent system of belief and technique  called a paradigm  A paradigm organizes a Mage s understanding of reality  how the universe works  and what things mean  It also provides the Mage with an understanding of how to change reality  through specific magical techniques  For example  an alchemical paradigm might describe the act of wood burning as the wood  releasing its essence of elemental Fire   while modern science would describe fire as  combustion resulting from a complex chemical reaction   Paradigms tend to be idiosyncratic to the individual Mage  but the vast majority belong to broad categories of paradigm  e g   Shamanism  Medieval Sorcery  religious miracle working  and superscience   In the Mage setting  everyday reality is governed by commonsense rules derived from the collective beliefs of sleepers  This is called the consensus  Most Magi s paradigms differ substantially from the consensus  When a mage performs an act of magic that does not seriously violate this commonsense version of reality  in game terms this is called coincidental magic  Magic that deviates wildly from consensus is called vulgar or dynamic magic  When it is performed ineptly  or is vulgar  and especially if it is vulgar and witnessed by sleepers  magic can cause Paradox  a phenomenon in which reality tries to resolve contradictions between the consensus and the Mage s efforts  Paradox is difficult to predict and almost always bad for the mage  The most common consequences of paradox include physical damage directly to the Mage s body  and paradox flaws  magic like effects which can for example turn the mage s hair green  make him mute  make him incapable of leaving a certain location  and so on  In more extreme cases paradox can cause Quiet  madness that may leak into reality   Paradox Spirits  nebulous  often powerful beings which purposefully set about resolving the contradiction  usually by directly punishing the mage   or even the removal of the Mage to a paradox realm  a pocket dimension from which it may be difficult to escape   In Mage  there is an underlying framework to reality called the Tapestry  The Tapestry is naturally divided into various sections  including the physical realm and various levels of the spirit world  or Umbra  At the most basic level  the Tapestry is composed of Quintessence  the essence of magic and what is real  Quintessence can have distinctive characteristics  called resonance  which are broken down into three categories  dynamic  static  and entropic   In order to understand the metaphysics of the Mage setting  it is important to remember that many of the terms used to describe magic and Magi e g   Avatar  Quintessence  the Umbra  and Paradox  Resonance  as well as the game mechanics a player uses to describe the areas of magic in which his character is proficient—the Spheres  look  mean  and are understood vary depending on the paradigm of the Mage in question  even though they are often  in the texts of the game  described from particular paradigmatic points of view  In character  only a Mage s Paradigm can explain what each of these things are  what they mean  and why it s the way it is   3  Game setting  3 1  History  3 1 1  Early times  In the game  Mages have always existed  though there are legends of the Pure Ones who were shards of the original  divine One  Early mages cultivated their magical beliefs alone or in small groups  generally conforming to and influencing the belief systems of their societies  Obscure myths suggest that the precursors of the modern organizations of mages originally gathered in ancient Egypt  This period of historical uncertainty also saw the rise of the Nephandi in the Near East  This set the stage for what the game s history calls the Mythic Ages   Until the late Middle Ages  mages  fortunes waxed and waned along with their native societies  Eventually  though  mages belonging to the Order of Hermes and the Messianic Voices attained great influence over European society  However  absorbed by their pursuit of occult power and esoteric knowledge  they often neglected and even abused humanity  Frequently  they were at odds with mainstream religions  envied by noble authorities and cursed by common folk   3 1 2  The Order of Reason  Mages who believed in proto scientific theories banded together under the banner of the Order of Reason  declaring their aim was to create a safe world with Man as its ruler  They won the support of Sleepers by developing the useful arts of manufacturing  economics  wayfaring  and medicine  They also championed many of the values that we now associate with the Renaissance  Masses of Sleepers embraced the gifts of early Technology and the Science that accompanied them  As the masses  beliefs shifted  the Consensus changed and wizards began to lose their position as their power and influence waned   This was intentional  The Order of Reason perceived a safe world as one devoid of heretical beliefs  ungodly practices and supernatural creatures preying upon humanity  As the defenders of the common folk  they intended to replace the dominant magical groups with a society of philosopher scientists as shepherds  protecting and guiding humanity  In response  non scientific mages banded together to form the Council of Nine Traditions where mages of all the major magical paths gathered  They fought on battlefields and in universities trying to undermine as many discoveries as they could  but to no avail   technology made the march of Science unstoppable  The Traditions  power bases were crippled  their believers mainly converted  their beliefs ridiculed all around the world  Their final counteroffensives against the Order of Reason were foiled by internal dissent and treachery in their midst   3 1 3  Rise of the Technocracy  However  from the turn of the 17th century on  the goals of the Order of Reason began to change  As their scientific paradigm unfolded  they decided that the mystical beliefs of the common people were not only backward  but dangerous  and that they should be replaced by cold  measurable and predictable physical laws and respect for human genius  They replaced long held theologies  pantheons  and mystical traditions with ideas like rational thought and the scientific method  As more and more sleepers began to use the Order s discoveries in their everyday lives  Reason and rationality came to govern their beliefs  and the old ways came to be regarded as misguided superstition  However  the Order of Reason became less and less focused on improving the daily lives of sleepers and more concerned with eliminating any resistance to their choke hold on the minds of humanity  Ever since a reorganization performed under Queen Victoria in the late 1800s  they call themselves the Technocracy   3 1 4  Contemporary setting  The Technocracy espouses an authoritarian rule over Sleepers  beliefs  while suppressing the Council of Nine s attempts to reintroduce magic  The Traditions replenished their numbers  which had been diminished by the withdrawal of two Traditions  the secretive Ahl i Batin  and the Solificati  alchemists plagued by scandal  with former Technocrats from the Sons of Ether and Virtual Adepts factions  vying for the beliefs of sleepers and with the Technocracy  and perpetually wary of the Nephandi  who consciously embrace evil and service to a demonic or alien master  and the Marauders  who resist Paradox with a magical form of madness   While the Technocracy s propaganda campaigns were effective in turning the Consensus against mystic and heterodox science  the Traditions maintained various resources  including magical nodes  hidden schools and fortresses called Chantries  and various realms outside of the Consensus in the Umbra   Finally  from 1997–2000  a series of metaplot events destroyed the Council of Nine s Umbral steadings  killing many of their most powerful members  This also cut the Technocracy off from their leadership  Both sides called a truce in their struggle to assess their new situation  especially since these events implied that Armageddon was soon at hand  Chief among these signs was creation of a barrier between the physical world and spirit world  This barrier was called the Avatar Storm because it affected the Avatar of the Mage  This Avatar Storm was the result of a battle in India on the so called  Week of Nightmares    These changes were introduced in supplements for the second edition of the game and became core material in the third edition   3 1 5  Later plot and finale  Aside from common changes introduced by the World of Darkness metaplot  mages dealt with renewed conflict when the hidden Rogue Council and the Technocracy s Panopticon encouraged the Traditions and Technocracy to struggle once again  The Rogue Council only made itself known through coded missives  while Panopticon was apparently created by the leaders of the Technocracy to counter it   This struggle eventually led to the point on the timeline occupied by the book called Ascension  While the entire metaplot has always been meant to be altered as each play group sees fit  Ascension provided multiple possible endings  with none of them being definitive  though one was meant to resolve the metaplot   Thus  there is no definitive canonical ending  Since the game is meant to be adapted to a group s tastes  the importance of this and the preceding storyline is largely a matter of personal preference   4  Factions  The metaplot of the game involves a four way struggle between the technological and authoritarian Technocracy  the insane Marauders  the cosmically evil Nephandi and the nine mystical Traditions  that tread the middle path   to which the player characters are assumed to belong   This struggle has in every edition of the game been characterized both as primarily a covert  violent war directly between factions  and primarily as an effort to sway the imaginations and beliefs of sleepers    4 1  Council of Nine Mystic Traditions  The Traditions  formally called the Nine Mystic Traditions  are a fictional alliance of secret societies in the Mage  the Ascension role playing game  The Traditions exist to unify users of magic under a common banner to protect reality  particularly those parts of reality that are magical  against the growing disbelief of the modern world  the spreading dominance of the Technocracy  and the predations of unstable mages such as Marauders and Nephandi  Each of the Traditions are largely independent organizations unified by a broadly accepted paradigm for practicing magic  The Traditions themselves vary substantially from one another  Some have almost no structure or rules  while others have rigid rules of protocol  etiquette  and rank  Though unified in their desire to keep magic alive  the magic practiced by different Traditions are often wildly different and entirely incompatible with one another  Understanding Traditions as a whole requires understanding each Tradition separately  and then assembling them into a somewhat cohesive whole   The nine traditions are  the Akashic Brotherhood  Celestial Chorus  Cult of Ecstasy  Dreamspeakers  Euthanatos  Order of Hermes  Sons of Ether  Verbena and Virtual Adepts   Mages of Akashic Brotherhood are ascetics  martial artists  and monks  largely drawing from Buddhism  Taoism  Shinto  Hinduism and other such religions  They are masters of the sphere of Mind   Mages of Celestial Chorus are pious believers in a supreme being that encompasses all Gods ever worshipped  They are masters of the sphere of Prime  the raw essence that fuels magic itself   Mages of Cult of Ecstasy are intuitive seers using sensory stimulation  consciousness expanding techniques  and meditation  They are masters of the sphere of Time   Mages of Dreamspeakers are shamanistic emissaries to the spirit world  They are masters of Spirit magic  such as summoning or binding spirits  necromancy  creating fetishes and travelling to the Umbra   Mages of Euthanatos are Thanatoic willworkers and killers drawing from a legacy of death cults in India  Greece  and the cultures of the Arabs and Celts  They are masters of the sphere of Entropy   Mages of Order of Hermes are formalized sorcerers  alchemists  and mystics drawing from classical occult practices  They are masters of the sphere of Forces   Mages of Sons of Ether are inspiration oriented scientists dedicated to fringe theories and alternative science  They are masters of the sphere of Matter   Mages of Verbena are blood shamans  healers and primordial witches and warlocks  They are masters of the sphere of Life   Mages of Virtual Adepts are technological adepts capable of informational wizardry  They are masters of the sphere of Correspondence  magic dealing with three dimensional location and space  communications   4 2  The Technocratic Union  The Technocracy is likewise divided into groups  unlike the Traditions  however  they share a single paradigm  and instead divide themselves based upon methodologies and areas of expertise   Technocrats of Iteration X are experts in the arena of the physical sciences  especially when it comes to mechanical and robotic advancements   Technocratic Progenitors  on the other hand  are masters of the biological sciences as a whole  including genetic engineering and the medical science   Technocrats of the New World Order maintain control of information and knowledge  controlling the thoughts and actions of the masses by directing what they learn and see   Technocrats of the Syndicate control the flow of money and power  though the two are frequently the same thing  between disparate groups   Technocratic members of the Void Engineers are explorers of the unknown  In the modern day  this not only extends to outer space  but to extradimensional planes of existence   4 3  Marauders  The Marauders are a group of mages that embody Dynamism  Marauders are chaos mages  They are completely insane  To other mages  they appear immune to paradox effects  often using vulgar magic to accomplish their insane tasks  Marauders represent the other narrative extreme  the repellent and frightening corruption of unrestrained power  of dynamism unchecked  Marauders are insane mages whose Avatars have been warped by their mental instability  and who exist in a state of permanent Quiet  While the nature of a Marauder s power may make them seem invincible  they are still severely hampered by their madness  They cannot become Archmages  as they lack sufficient insight and are incapable of appreciating truths which do not suit their madness  In the second edition of Mage  The Ascension  Marauders were much more cogent and likely to operate in groups  with the Umbral Underground using the Umbra to infiltrate any location and wreak havoc with the aid of bygones  They were also associated heavily with other perceived agents of Dynamism  particularly the Changing Breeds  who equate Dynamism with the Wyld  and sometimes Changelings  For example  the Marauders chapter in The Book of Madness is narrated by a Corax  were raven  named Johnny Gore  who relates his experiences running with the Butcher Street Regulars  In the revised edition  Marauders were made darker and less coherent  in keeping with the more serious treatment of madness used for Malkavians in Vampire  The Masquerade Revised Edition  The Avatar Storm was a very convenient explanation for the Underground s loss of power and influence  though they also became more vulnerable to Paradox  In this edition  the Regulars are a cell of the Underground  and like the other cells have highly compatible Quiets   4 4  Nephandi  With the Technocracy representing Stasis and the Marauders acting on behalf of Dynamism  the third part of this trifecta is Entropy  as borne by the Nephandi  While other mages may be callous or cruel  the Nephandi are morally inverted and spiritually mutilated  While a Traditionalist or Technocrat may simply fall prey to human failings or excessive zeal in their ethos  while a Marauder may well commit some true atrocities in the depth of her incurable madness  a Nephandus retains a clear moral compass  and deliberately pursues actions to worsen the world and bring about its final end  To this end  the Technocracy and Traditions have been known to set aside the ongoing war for reality to temporarily join forces to oppose the Nephandi  Some of their members  called barabbi  hail from the Technocracy and Traditions  but all Nephandi have experienced the Rebirth  wherein they embrace the antithesis of everything they know to be right  and are physically and spiritually torn apart and reassembled  This metamorphosis has a sort of terrible permanence to it  while each Mage s avatar will be reborn again and again  theirs is permanently twisted as a result of their rebirth  known as Widderslainte  these mages awaken as Nephandi  While some of the background stories detail a particular mage and her teacher trying  and succeeding  at keeping her from falling again  this is very rare   4 5  Others  Another tradition  but not part of the nine are the mages of Ahl i Batin  also known as The Subtle Ones   They are masters of the Correspondence Sphere and former holders of the seat now held by the Virtual Adepts  Others include Crafts  The Taftani and the Hollow Ones  Nephandi embody a corruption seductive to mages   5  Rules and continuity  The core rules of the game are similar to those in other World of Darkness games  see Storyteller System for an explanation   Like other storytelling games Mage emphasizes personal creativity and that ultimately the game s powers and traits should be used to tell a satisfying story  One of Mage s highlights is its system for describing magic  based on spheres  a relatively open ended  toolkit  approach to using game mechanics to define the bounds of a given character s magical ability  Different Mages will have differing aptitudes for spheres  and player characters  magical expertise is described by allocation of points in the spheres   There are nine known spheres   5 1  Correspondence  Deals with spatial relations  giving the Mage power over space and distances  Correspondence magic allows powers such as teleportation  seeing into distant areas  and at higher levels the Mage may also co locate herself or even stack different spaces within each other  Correspondence can be combined with almost any other sphere to create effects that span distances   5 2  Entropy  This sphere gives the Mage power over order  chaos  fate and fortune  A mage can sense where elements of chance influence the world and manipulate them to some degree  At simple levels machines can be made to fail  plans to go off without a hitch  and games of chance heavily influenced  Advanced mages can craft self propagating memes or curse entire family lines with blights  The only requirement of the Entropy sphere is that all interventions work within the general flow of natural entropy   5 3  Forces  Forces concerns energies and natural forces and their negative opposites  i e  light and shadow can both be manipulated independently with this Sphere   Essentially  anything in the material world that can be seen or felt but is not material can be controlled  electricity  gravity  magnetism  friction  heat  motion  fire  etc  At low levels the mage can control forces on a small scale  changing their direction  converting one energy into another  At high levels  storms and explosions can be conjured  Obviously  this Sphere tends to do the most damage and is the most flashy and vulgar  Along with Life and Matter  Forces is one of the three  Pattern Spheres  which together are able to mold all aspects of the physical world   5 4  Life  Life deals with understanding and influencing biological systems  Generally speaking  any material object with mostly living cells falls under the influence of this sphere  Simply  this allows the mage to heal herself or transform simple life forms at lower levels  working up to healing others and controlling more complex life at higher levels  Usually  seeking to improve a complex life form beyond natural limits causes the condition of pattern bleeding  the affected life form begins to wither and die over time  Along with Matter and Forces  Life is one of the three Pattern Spheres   5 5  Mind  Dealing with control over one s own mind  the reading and influencing of other minds  and a variety of subtler applications such as Astral Projection and psychometry  At high levels  Mages can create new complete minds or completely rework existing ones   5 6  Matter  Matter deals with all inanimate material  Thus  being alive protects a thing from direct manipulation by the Matter sphere  Stone  dead wood  water  gold  and the corpses of once living things are only the beginning  With this Sphere  matter can be reshaped mentally  transmuted into another substance  or given altered properties  Along with Life and Forces  Matter is one of the three Pattern Spheres   5 7  Prime  This sphere deals directly with Quintessence  the raw material of the tapestry  which is the metaphysical structure of reality  This sphere allows Quintessence to be channeled and or funneled in any way at higher levels  and it is necessary if the mage ever wants to conjure something out of nothing as opposed to transforming one pattern into another   Uses of Prime include general magic senses  counter magic  and making magical effects permanent   5 8  Spirit  This sphere is an eclectic mixture of abilities relating to dealings with the spirit world or Umbra  It includes stepping into the Near Umbra right up to traveling through outer space  contacting and controlling spirits  communing with your own or others  avatars  returning a Mage into a sleeper  returning ghosts to life  creating magical fetish items  and so forth  Unlike other Spheres  the difficulty of Spirit magic is often a factor of the Gauntlet  making these spells harder for the most part  The Sphere is referred to as Dimensional Science by the Technocratic Union   5 9  Time  This sphere deals with dilating  slowing  stopping or traveling through time  Due to game mechanics  it is simpler to travel forward in time than backwards  Time can be used to install delays into spells  view the past or future  and even pull people and objects out of linear progression  Time magic offers one means to speed up a character to get multiple actions in a combat round  a much coveted power in turn based role playing   5 10  The tenth sphere  One of the plot hooks that the second edition books put forth were persistent rumors of a  tenth sphere   Though there were hints  it was deliberately left vague  The final book in the line  Ascension implies that the tenth sphere is the sphere of Ascension  in as much as spheres are practically relevant at that point in the story   As the book presents alternative resolutions for the Mage line  Chapter Two also presents an alternative interpretation that the tenth sphere is  Judgement  or  Telos  and that Anthelios  the red star in the World of Darkness metaplot  is its planet  each sphere has an associated planet and Umbral realm    5 11  Sphere sigils  The various sphere sigils are  in whole or in part  symbols taken from alchemical texts   Correspondence is a symbol for amalgam or amalgamation   Amalgama    Entropy is a symbol for rotting or decay   Putredo putrefactio    The sigil of Forces is part of the symbol for  boiling    Ebbulio    Life is a symbol for composition   Compositio    As with Correspondence  the sigil of Matter is another symbol for the process of amalgamation   Amalgama    Mind is a symbol for solution   Solutio    Prime is a symbol meaning essence   Essentia    Spirit may be derived from the symbol for fumes   Fumus    Time is the symbol for dust   Pulvis    The tenth symbol depicted in Ascension is a symbol for vinegar  Mage  The Sorcerer s Crusade also presented a symbol for the tenth sphere  a combination of the symbols for stone and distillation  Because Mage s themes are potentially quite complex and esoteric  and because its Sphere system rules are relatively open ended  Mage is often daunting  particularly to novice roleplayers and those accustomed to other games whose rules govern the use of magic with greater precision but less flexibility  e g   games with catalogs of established  spells     The third revision of the rules  Mage  The Ascension Revised  made significant changes to the rules and setting  mainly to update Mage with respect to its own ongoing storyline  particularly in regards to events that occurred during the run of the game s second edition   Like other World of Darkness games  Mage uses a continuing storyline across all of its books    6  See also  List of Mage  The Ascension books  7  References  8  External links
