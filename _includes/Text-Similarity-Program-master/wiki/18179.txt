In some English speaking countries in the Northern Hemisphere  August 1 is Lammas Day  Anglo Saxon hlaf mas   loaf mass    the festival of the wheat harvest  and is the first harvest festival of the year  On this day it was customary to bring to church a loaf made from the new crop  which began to be harvested at Lammastide   The loaf was blessed  and in Anglo Saxon England it might be employed afterwards to work magic  a book of Anglo Saxon charms directed that the lammas bread be broken into four bits  which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn  to protect the garnered grain   In many parts of England  tenants were bound to present freshly harvested wheat to their landlords on or before the first day of August  In the Anglo Saxon Chronicle  where it is referred to regularly  it is called  the feast of first fruits   The blessing of first fruits was performed annually in both the Eastern and Western Churches on the first or the sixth of August  the latter being the feast of the Transfiguration of Christ    Lammas coincides with the feast of St  Peter in Chains  commemorating St  Peter s miraculous deliverance from prison   1  History  In medieval times the feast was sometimes known in England and Scotland as the  Gule of August   but the meaning of  gule  is unclear  Ronald Hutton suggests following the 18th century Welsh clergyman antiquary John Pettingall that it is merely an Anglicisation of Gŵyl Awst  the Welsh name of the  feast of August   OED and most etymological dictionaries give it a more circuitous origin similar to gullet  from O Fr  goulet  dim  of goule   throat  neck   from L  gula  throat     Several antiquaries beginning with John Brady offered a back construction to its being originally known as Lamb mass  under the undocumented supposition that tenants of the Cathedral of York  dedicated to St  Peter ad Vincula  of which this is the feast  would have been required to bring a live lamb to the church  or  with John Skinner   because Lambs then grew out of season   This is a folk etymology  of which OED notes that it was  subsequently felt as if from LAMB + MASS    For many villeins  the wheat must have run low in the days before Lammas  and the new harvest began a season of plenty  of hard work and company in the fields  reaping in teams  Thus there was a spirit of celebratory play   In the medieval agricultural year  Lammas also marked the end of the hay harvest that had begun after Midsummer  At the end of hay making a sheep would be loosed in the meadow among the mowers  for him to keep who could catch it   In Shakespeare s Romeo and Juliet  1 3 19  it is observed of Juliet   Come Lammas Eve at night shall she  Juliet  be fourteen   Since Juliet was born Lammas eve  she came before the harvest festival  which is significant since her life ended before she could reap what she had sown and enjoy the bounty of the harvest  in this case full consummation and enjoyment of her love with Romeo   Another well known cultural reference is the opening of The Battle of Otterburn   It fell about the Lammas tide when the muir men win their hay    William Hone speaks in The Every Day Book  1838  of a later festive Lammas day sport common among Scottish farmers near Edinburgh  He says that they  build towers   leaving a hole for a flag pole in the centre so that they may raise their colours   When the flags over the many peat constructed towers were raised  farmers would go to others  towers and attempt to  level them to the ground   A successful attempt would bring great praise  However  people were allowed to defend their towers  and so everyone was provided with a  tooting horn  to alert nearby country folk of the impending attack and the battle would turn into a  brawl   According to Hone  more than four people had died at this festival and many more were injured  At the day s end  races were held  with prizes given to the townspeople   2  Neopaganism  Lughnasadh or Lammas is also the name used for one of the eight sabbats in the Neopagan Wheel of the Year  It is the first of the three autumn harvest festivals  the other two being the autumn equinox  also called Mabon  and Samhain  In the Northern Hemisphere it takes place around August 1  while in the Southern Hemisphere it is celebrated around February 1   3  Other uses  Lammas is one of the Scottish quarter days   Lammas leaves or Lammas growth refers to a second crop of leaves produced in high summer by some species of trees in temperate countries to replace those lost to insect damage  They often differ slightly in shape  texture and or hairiness from the earlier leaves   In the Inspector Morse episode  Day of the Devil   Lammas Day is presented as a Satanic  un holy day   the Devil s day    3 1  In popular culture  The Doctor Who serial  The Image of the Fendahl  takes place on Lammas Eve   4  See also  Lughnasadh  Harvest festival  Harvest Home  Ould Lammas Fair  Leyton Marshes  5  References  6
