Thorium is a chemical element with symbol Th and atomic number 90  A radioactive actinide metal  thorium is one of only three radioactive elements that still occurs in quantity in nature as a primordial element  the other two being bismuth and uranium   It was discovered in 1828 by the Norwegian mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius  who named it after Thor  the Norse god of thunder   A thorium atom has 90 protons and therefore 90 electrons  of which four are valence electrons  Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air  Thorium is weakly radioactive  all its known isotopes are unstable  with the six naturally occurring ones  thorium 227  228  230  231  232  and 234  having half lives between 25 52 hours and 14 05 billion years  Thorium 232  which has 142 neutrons  is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium  with the other five natural isotopes occurring only in traces  it decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium 228  starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at lead 208  Thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth s crust  and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by product of extracting rare earth metals   Thorium was once commonly used as the light source in gas mantles and as an alloying material  but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity  Thorium is also used as an alloying element in nonconsumable TIG welding electrodes  It remains popular as a material in high end optics and scientific instrumentation  thorium and uranium are the only radioactive elements with major commercial applications that do not rely on their radioactivity  Thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors  but only a few thorium reactors have yet been completed   1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical  Thorium is a soft  paramagnetic  bright silvery radioactive actinide metal  In the periodic table  it is located to the right of the actinide actinium  to the left of the actinide protactinium and below the lanthanide cerium  Pure thorium is soft  very ductile  and can be cold rolled  swaged  and drawn   The measured properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample used  the major impurity is usually thorium dioxide  ThO2   The purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide  Its density has been calculated to be 11 724 g cm3  while experimental measurements give values between 11 5 and 11 66 g cm3  these values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium  10 07 g cm3  and protactinium  15 37 g cm3   showing the continuity of trends across the actinide series  However  thorium s melting point of 1750 °C is above both that of actinium  1227 °C  and that of protactinium  1562±15 °C   the melting points of the actinides do not have a clear dependence on their number of f electrons  although there is a smooth trend downward from thorium to plutonium where the number of f electrons increases from zero to six  Thorium is a soft metal  having a bulk modulus of 54 GPa  comparable to those of tin and scandium  The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel  so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire  Thorium becomes superconductive below 1 40 K  Nevertheless  while thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium  it is harder than either of them  Among the actinides  thorium has the highest melting point and second lowest density  second only to actinium   The thermal expansion  electrical and thermal conductivities of thorium  protactinium  and uranium are comparable and are typical of post transition metals   Thorium can also form alloys with many other metals  With chromium and uranium  it forms eutectic mixtures  and thorium is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium   1 2  Chemical  Thorium is a highly reactive metal  At standard temperature and pressure  thorium is slowly attacked by water  but does not readily dissolve in most common acids  the exception being hydrochloric acid  It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions  if these are not present  passivation can occur  At high temperatures  it is easily attacked by oxygen  hydrogen  nitrogen  the halogens  and sulfur  It can also form binary compounds with carbon and phosphorus  When thorium dissolves in hydrochloric acid  a black residue  probably ThO OH Cl H  is left behind   Finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its pyrophoricity and must therefore be handled carefully  When heated in air  thorium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide  In bulk  the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow  although corrosion may eventually occur after several months  most thorium samples are however contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide  which greatly accelerates corrosion  Such samples slowly tarnish in air  becoming gray and finally black   The most important oxidation state of thorium is +4  represented in compounds such as thorium dioxide  ThO2  and thorium tetrafluoride  ThF4   although +3  +2  and +1 states are also known  as in thorium tribromide  ThBr3   thorium dihydride  ThH2   and thorium monobromide  ThBr   Owing to thorium IV  s lack of electrons on 6d and 5f orbitals  the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless   In aqueous solution  thorium occurs exclusively as the tetrapositive aqua ion  Th H2O 9 4+  which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry  at pH ` 3  the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation  The Th–O bond distance is  245 ± 1  pm  the coordination number of Th4+ is  10 8 ± 0 5   the effective charge is 3 82 and the second coordination sphere contains 13 4 water molecules  The Th4+ ion is relatively large and is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions  and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0 95 and 1 14 Å  As a result  thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyze  weaker than that of many multiply charged ions such as Fe3+  The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility  not only in water  but also in polar organic solvents   Thorium has been shown to activate carbon–hydrogen bonds  forming unusual compounds  Thorium atoms can also bond to more atoms than any other element  for instance  in the compound thorium aminodiboranate  thorium has a coordination number of fifteen   1 3  Atomic  A thorium atom has 90 electrons  of which four are valence electrons  Four atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy  5f  6d  7s  and 7p  However  the 7p orbital is greatly destabilized and hence it is not occupied in the ground state of any thorium ion  Despite thorium s position in the f block of the periodic table  it has an anomalous  Rn 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state  However  in metallic thorium  the  Rn 5f16d17s2 configuration is a low lying excited state and hence the 5f orbitals contribute  existing in a rather broad energy band   The ground state electron configurations of thorium ions are as follows  Th+   Rn 6d27s1  Th2+   Rn 5f16d1  Th3+   Rn 5f1  Th4+   Rn   This shows the increasing stabilization of the 5f orbital as ion charge increases  however  this stabilization is insufficient to chemically stabilize Th3+ with its lone 5f valence electron  and therefore the stable and most common form of thorium in chemicals is Th4+ with all four valence electrons lost  leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon  The first ionization potential of thorium was measured to be  6 08 ± 0 12  eV in 1974  more recent measurements have refined this to 6 3067 eV   1 4  Isotopes  Although thorium has 6 naturally occurring isotopes  none of these isotopes are stable  however  one isotope  232Th  is relatively stable  with a half life of 14 05 billion years  considerably longer than the age of the earth  and even slightly longer than the generally accepted age of the universe  about 13 8 billion years   This isotope is the longest lived of all isotopes with more than 83 protons and makes up nearly all natural thorium  As such  thorium is generally considered to be mononuclidic  However  in deep seawaters the isotope 230Th becomes more significant  which led to IUPAC reclassifying thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013  In fact  uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope  Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition  consisting largely of 232Th and a little 230Th  and thus an atomic mass can be given  which is 232 0377 4  u   232Th is the longest lived isotope in the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4  begins with the alpha decay of 232Th to 228Ra  and terminates at stable 208Pb  and its longevity means that the isotopes in its decay chain still exist in nature as radiogenic nuclides despite their short half lives  As such  natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides  such as lead 212  212Pb   which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy   Thirty radioisotopes have been characterized  which range in mass number from 209 to 238  The most stable of them  after 232Th  are 230Th with a half life of 75 380 years  229Th with a half life of 7 340 years  228Th with a half life of 1 92 years  234Th with a half life of 24 10 days  and 227Th with a half life of 18 68 days  all of these isotopes except 229Th occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of 232Th  235U  and 238U  All of the remaining thorium isotopes have half lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half lives that are less than ten minutes  The isotope 229Th has a nuclear isomer  or metastable state  with a remarkably low excitation energy  recently measured to be  7 6 ± 0 5  eV   In the early history of the study of radioactivity  the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names  In this scheme  227Th was named radioactinium  RdAc   228Th radiothorium  RdTh   230Th ionium  Io   231Th uranium Y  UY   232Th thorium  Th   and 234Th uranium X1  UX1   When it was realized that all of these are isotopes of thorium  many of these names fell out of use  and  thorium  came to refer to all isotopes  not just 232Th  However  the name ionium is still encountered for 230Th in the context of ionium thorium dating   Different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically  but do have slightly differing physical properties  for example  the densities of 228Th  229Th  230Th  and 232Th in g·cm−3 are respectively expected to be 11 524  11 575  11 626  and 11 727  The isotope 229Th is expected to be fissionable with a bare critical mass of 2839 kg  although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994 kg  While 232Th  the most common thorium isotope  is not fissionable  it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile 233U using neutron capture   2  History  2 1  Discovery  In 1815  the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius analyzed a mineral from a copper mine in Falun  Assuming that a new element was contained in the mineral  he named the supposed element  thorium  after Thor  the Norse god of thunder  However  the mineral later proved to actually be an yttrium mineral  primarily composed of yttrium orthophosphate  As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element  the mineral was named xenotime from the Greek words κενός  vain  and τιμή  honor    In 1828  Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island  Norway  and gave a sample to his father  Jens Esmark  a noted mineralogist  The elder Esmark was not able to identify it and sent a sample to the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius for examination  Berzelius determined that it contained a new element  He published his findings in 1829  Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery  Thus  he named the source mineral thorite  which has the chemical composition  Th U SiO4   2 2  Subsequent developments  In Dmitri Mendeleev s 1869 periodic table  thorium and the rare earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table  at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals  This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent  With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent  Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871  which contained the modern carbon group  titanium group  cerium  and thorium  because their maximum oxidation state was +4  While cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series  it was not until 1945 that Glenn T  Seaborg realized that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f block row  instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium and filling a fourth d block row   Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898  independently  by the Polish French physicist Marie Curie and the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt  Between 1900 and 1903  Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements  This observation led to the identification of half life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity   Although thorium was discovered in 1828  it had no applications until 1885  when Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle  After 1885  many applications were found for thorium and its compounds  In recent decades  however  most of these applications that do not depend on thorium s radioactivity have declined due to safety and environmental concerns   3  Occurrence  Thorium 232 is a primordial nuclide  having existed in its current form for over 4 5 billion years  predating the formation of the Earth  it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovae  Its radioactive decay produces a significant amount of the Earth s internal heat   Natural thorium is essentially monoisotopic 232Th  which is the longest lived and most stable isotope of thorium  having a half life comparable to the age of the universe  If the source contains no uranium  the only other thorium isotope present would be 228Th  which occurs in the decay chain of thorium 232  the thorium series   the ratio of 228Th to 232Th would be under 10−10  However  if uranium is present  tiny traces of several other isotopes will be present  231Th and 227Th from the decay chain of uranium 235  the actinium series   and slightly larger but still tiny traces of 234Th and 230Th from the decay chain of uranium 238  the uranium series   Earlier in the Earth s history  229Th would also have been produced in the now extinct decay chain of 237Np  the neptunium series   it is now only produced as a daughter of artificial uranium 233  itself produced from neutron irradiation of 232Th   On Earth  thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought  having an abundance comparable to that of lead and molybdenum  twice that of arsenic  and thrice that of tin  In nature  it occurs in the +4 oxidation state  together with uranium IV   zirconium IV   hafnium IV   and cerium IV   but also with the scandium  yttrium  and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii  However  thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals   Thorium minerals occur on all continents  Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth s crust than all isotopes of uranium combined and thorium 232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium 235  Because of thorium s radioactivity  minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often metamict  their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium  An extreme example is ekanite   Ca Fe Pb 2 Th U Si8O20   which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition   Monazite is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide and contains 2 5% thorium  It is a chemically unreactive phosphate mineral that has a high specific gravity and is found as yellow or brown monazite sand  its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it  Allanite can have 0 1–2% thorium and zircon up to 0 4% thorium   Thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite  which usually contains up to 12% ThO2  However  due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide  the two actinide dioxides can form solid state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the ThO2 content  Thorite  or thorium silicate  ThSiO4   also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered  In thorium silicate minerals  the Th4+ and ions are often replaced with M3+  M   Sc  Y  Ln  and phosphate    ions respectively   4  Production  Thorium is extracted mostly from monazite  thorium diphosphate  Th PO4 2  is reacted with nitric acid  and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate  Rare earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution   In another extraction method  monazite is decomposed with a 45% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140 °C  Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first  filtered at 80 °C  washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid  Next  the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH   5 8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide  Th OH 4  contaminated with ~3% of rare earth hydroxides  the remaining rare earth hydroxides remain in solution  Thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements  An efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid  because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents   Metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide or chloride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere   Sometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800 °C in a graphite crucible  Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process   5  Compounds  5 1  Oxides and hydroxides  In air  thorium turnings burn to form the simple dioxide  ThO2  also called thoria or thorina  Thoria  a refractory material  has the highest melting point  3390 °C  of all known oxides  It is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases  When heated  it emits intense blue light  which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homolog cerium dioxide  CeO2  ceria   this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles  Related to thoria is the oxoanion   found in BaThO3 and K2ThO3  Reports of thorium peroxide  initially supposed to be Th2O7 and be formed from reacting thorium salts with hydrogen peroxide  were later discovered to contain both peroxide anions and the anions of the reacting thorium salt  Thorium monoxide has recently been produced through laser ablation of thorium in the presence of oxygen  This highly polar molecule has the largest known internal electric field   Thorium hydroxide  Th OH 4  can be prepared by adding a hydroxide of ammonium or an alkali metal to a thorium salt solution  where it appears as a gelatinous precipitate that will dissolve in dilute acids  among other substances  It can also be prepared by electrolysis of thorium nitrates  It is stable from 260–450 °C  at 470 °C and above it continuously decomposes to become thoria  It easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate ThOCO3·xH2O and  under high pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere  Th CO3 2·0 5H2O or Th OH 2CO3·2H2O   5 2  Halides  All four thorium tetrahalides are known  as are some low valent bromides and iodides  Additionally  many related polyhalide ions are also known  Thorium tetrafluoride  ThF4  is most easily produced by reacting various thorium salts  thoria  or thorium hydroxide with hydrogen fluoride  methods that involve steps in the aqueous phase are more difficult because they result in hydroxide and oxide fluorides that have to be reduced with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas  It has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride  where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms  It is a white  hygroscopic powder  at temperatures above 500 °C  it reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce the oxyfluoride ThOF2   Thorium tetrachloride  ThCl4  can be produced in many ways  The usual method is crystallization from an aqueous solution and then heating the product above 100 °C to dehydrate it  Further purification can be achieved by subliming it  Its melting and boiling points are respectively 770 °C and 921 °C  It undergoes a phase transition at 405 °C  with a low temperature α phase and high temperature β phase  Nevertheless  the β phase usually persists below the transition temperature  Both phases crystallize in the tetragonal crystal system and the structural differences are small  Below −203 °C  a low temperature form exists with a complex structure   Thorium tetrabromide  ThBr4  can be produced either by reacting thorium IV  hydroxide with hydrobromic acid  which has the disadvantage of often resulting in products contaminated with oxybromides  or by directly reacting bromine or hydrogen bromide with thorium metal or compounds  The product can then be purified by sublimation at 600 °C in a vacuum  The melting and boiling points are 679 °C and 857 °C  Like the tetrachloride  both an α and a β form exist and both are isotypic to the tetrachloride forms  though the phase transition here occurs at 426 °C  There is also a low temperature form  Incomplete reports of the lower bromides ThBr3  ThBr2  and ThBr are known  the last only known as a gas phase molecular species   ThBr3 and ThBr2 are known to be very reactive and at high temperatures disproportionate   Thorium tetraiodide  ThI4  is prepared by direct reaction of the elements in a sealed silica ampoule  Water and oxygen must not be present  or else ThOI2 and ThO2 can contaminate the product  It has a different crystal structure from the other tetrahalides  being monoclinic  The lower iodides ThI3 and ThI2 can be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal   ThI is also predicted to form as an intermediate in the dissociation of ThI4 to thorium metal   These do not contain Th III  and Th II   but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as and respectively  Depending on the amount of time allowed for the reaction between ThI4 and thorium  two modifications of ThI3 can be produced  shorter times give thin lustrous rods of α ThI3  while longer times give small β ThI3 crystals with green to brass colored luster  ThI2 also has two modifications  which can be produced by varying the reaction temperature  at 600 °C  α ThI2 is formed  while a reaction temperature of 700–850 °C produces β ThI2  which has a golden luster   Many polynary halides with the alkali metals  barium  thallium  and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides  chlorides  and bromides  For example  when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid  Th4+ forms the complex anion   which precipitates as an insoluble salt  K2ThF6   5 3  Chalcogenides and pnictides  The heavier chalcogens sulfur  selenium  and tellurium are known to form thorium chalcogenides  many of which have more complex structure than the oxides  Apart from several binary compounds  the oxychalcogenides ThOS  yellow   ThOSe  and ThOTe are also known  The five binary thorium sulfides – ThS  lustrous metallic   Th2S3  brown metallic   Th7S12  black   ThS2  purple brown   and Th2S5  orange brown  – may be produced by reacting hydrogen sulfide with thorium  its halides  or thoria  the last if carbon is present   they all hydrolyze in acidic solutions  The six selenides are analogous to the sulfides  with the addition of ThSe3  The five tellurides are also similar to the sulfides and selenides  although Th2Te5 is unknown   but have slightly different crystal structures  for example  ThS has the sodium chloride structure  but ThTe has the caesium chloride structure   All five chemically characterized pnictogens  nitrogen  phosphorus  arsenic  antimony  and bismuth  also form compounds with thorium  Three thorium nitrides are known  ThN  Th3N4  and Th2N3  The brass colored Th3N4 is most easily produced by heating thorium metal in a nitrogen atmosphere  Th3N4 and Th2N3 decompose to the golden yellow ThN  and indeed ThN can often be seen covering the surface of Th3N4 samples because Th3N4 is hygroscopic and water vapor in the air can decompose it  thin films of ThN are metallic in character and  like all other actinide mononitrides  has the sodium chloride structure  ThN is also a low temperature superconductor  All three nitrides can react with thorium halides to form halide nitrides ThNX  X   F  Cl  Br  I   The heavier pnictogens also form analogous monopnictides  except ThBi which has not yet been structurally characterized  The other well characterized thorium pnictides are Th3P4  Th2P11  ThP7  Th3As4  ThAs2  Th3Sb4  ThSb2  and ThBi2   5 4  Other inorganic  Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15  the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7 5–8 K  at standard temperature and pressure  it conducts electricity like a metal  Finely divided thorium metal reacts very readily with hydrogen at standard conditions  but large pieces may need to be heated to 300–400 °C for a reaction to take place  Around 850 °C  the reaction forming first ThH2 and then Th4H15 occurs without breaking up the structure of the thorium metal  Thorium hydrides react readily with oxygen or steam to form thoria  and at 250–350 °C quickly react with hydrogen halides  sulfides  phosphides  and nitrides to form the corresponding thorium binary compounds   Three binary thorium borides are known  ThB6  ThB4  and ThB12  The last is isotypic with UB12  While reports of ThB66 and ThB76 exist  they may simply be thorium stabilized boron allotropes  The three known binary thorium carbides are ThC2  Th2C3  and ThC  all are produced by reacting thorium or thoria with carbon  ThC and ThC2 are refractory solids and have melting points over 2600 °C   Many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known  such as the perchlorates  sulfates  sulfites  nitrates  carbonates  phosphates  vanadates  molybdates  chromates  and other oxometallates  many of which are known in hydrated forms  These are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste  but most have not yet been fully characterized  especially on their structural properties  For example  thorium perchlorate is very water soluble and crystallizes from acidic solutions as the tetrahydrate Th ClO4 4·4H2O  while thorium nitrate forms tetra  and pentahydrates  is soluble in water and alcohols  and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds   5 5  Organometallic and other carbon containing compounds  Like many of the early and middle actinides  thorium through americium  and also expected for curium   thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th C8H8   thorocene  It is isotypic with the more well known analogous uranium compound  uranocene  It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran  THF  at the temperature of dry ice  or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8  It is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190 °C  Many other organothorium compounds are known  many involving the cyclopentadienyl anion  Some coordination complexes with carboxylates and acetylacetonates are also known  although these are not organothorium compounds   6  Applications  6 1  Nuclear  Due to environmental concerns over thorium s radioactivity that cause its non nuclear applications to sharply decrease in importance  the most important possible use of thorium is now its possible use in the thorium fuel cycle as a nuclear fuel  as its applications in radiometric dating  which depend on its radioactivity  are mostly specialized   6 1 1  Nuclear energy  In thermal breeder reactors  the fertile isotope 232Th  the most common thorium isotope  is bombarded by slow neutrons  undergoing neutron capture to become 233Th  which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first 233Pa and then the fissile 233U   233U is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more commonly used 235U or 239Pu  When 233U undergoes nuclear fission  the neutrons emitted can strike further 232Th nuclei  restarting the cycle  This closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where 238U undergoes neutron capture to become 239U  beta decaying to first 239Np and then fissile 239Pu  The main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer   An added advantage 233U and 239Pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei  except the naturally occurring 235U  is that they can be bred from the naturally occurring quantity isotopes 232Th and 238U  Additionally  233U is easily detected  can be mixed with 238U to prevent direct use in nuclear weapons and limit nuclear proliferation  and has a higher neutron yield than 239Pu  Thorium fuels also result in a safer and better performing reactor core because thoria has a higher melting point  higher thermal conductivity  and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the now common fuel uranium dioxide  UO2   thoria also exhibits greater chemical stability and  unlike uranium dioxide  does not further oxidize   A single neutron capture by 238U would produce transuranic waste  along with it fissile 239Pu  whereas six captures are generally necessary to do so from 232Th  98–99% of thorium cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233U or 235U  so fewer long lived transuranics are produced  Because of this  thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide  MOX  fuels to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium  The disadvantages of the thorium fuel cycle include the need to neutron irradiate and process natural 232Th before these advantages become real  and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium  nevertheless  advances are being made in this technology   In 1997  the U S  Energy Department underwrote research into thorium fuel  and research also was begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA   to study the use of thorium reactors  Nuclear scientist Alvin Radkowsky of Tel Aviv University in Israel founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors  which included other companies  Raytheon Nuclear Inc   Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow  Radkowsky was chief scientist in the U S  nuclear submarine program directed by Admiral Hyman Rickover and later headed the design team that built the USA s first civilian nuclear power plant at Shippingport  Pennsylvania  which was a scaled up version of the first naval reactor  The third Shippingport core  initiated in 1977  bred thorium  Even earlier examples of reactors using fuel with thorium exist  including the first core at the Indian Point Energy Center in 1962  However  in most countries uranium was relatively abundant and hence research into thorium fuel waned for a while  A notable exception was India s three stage nuclear power programme  In the twenty first century thorium s potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle  Currently  some countries such as India are developing technology for thorium nuclear reactors   6 1 2  Radiometric dating  Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes  uranium thorium dating  involving the decay of 234U to 230Th  ionium   and ionium thorium dating  which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th  These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope  but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U  Uranium thorium dating is a relatively short range process because of the short half lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth  it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235U into 231Th  which very quickly becomes the longer lived 231Pa  and this process is often used to check the results of uranium thorium dating  Uranium thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral  because while uranium is rather soluble in water  thorium and protactinium are not  and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean floor sediments  from which their ratios are measured  The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years  Ionium thorium dating is a related process  which exploits the insolubility of thorium  both 232Th and 230Th  and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th  Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of thorium 230 to thorium 232 is a constant during the time period when the sediment layer was formed  that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium  and that the thorium cannot shift within the sediment layer   6 2  Non nuclear  Many non nuclear applications of thorium are becoming obsolete due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products   The melting point of thoria is 3300 °C – the highest of all known oxides  Only a few elements  including tungsten and carbon  and a few compounds  including tantalum carbide  have higher melting points   This means that when heated to high temperatures  it does not melt  but merely glows with an intense blue light  addition of cerium dioxide gives a bright white light  This property of thoria means that thoria and thorium nitrate are used in mantles of portable gas lights  including natural gas lamps  oil lamps and camping lights  A study in 1981 estimated that the dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend for a year would be 0 3 0 6 millirems  mrem   tiny in comparison to the normal annual dose of a few hundred millirems  a person actually ingesting a mantle would receive a dose of 200 mrem  2 mSv    However  the radioactivity is a major concern for people involved with the manufacture of mantles  and an issue with contamination of soil around some former factory sites  Due to these concerns  some manufacturers have switched to other materials  such as yttrium  although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient  Other manufacturers continue to make thorium mantles  but moved their factories to developing countries   Thoria is a material for heat resistant ceramics  as used in high temperature laboratory crucibles  When added to glass  it helps increase refractive index and decrease dispersion  Such glass finds application in high quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments  The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film  but the health risks are minimal  Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colorless state with lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation   Thoria was used to control the grain size of tungsten metal used for spirals of electric lamps  Thoriated tungsten elements are found in the filaments of vacuum tubes  e g  magnetron found in microwave oven  Thorium is added because it lowers the effective work function with the result that the thoriated tungsten thermocathode emits electrons at considerably lower temperatures  Thoria has been used as a catalyst in the conversion of ammonia to nitric acid  in petroleum cracking and in producing sulfuric acid  It is the active ingredient of Thorotrast  which was used as radiocontrast agent for X ray diagnostics because of thorium s high opacity to X rays  This use has been abandoned due to its carcinogenic nature   Thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings  It has excellent optical transparency in the range of 0 35–12 µm  and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles  which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material  Thorium tetrafluoride was also used in manufacturing carbon arc lamps  which provided high intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights   7  Precautions  As thorium occurs naturally  it exists in very small quantities almost everywhere on Earth  the average human contains about 100 micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day of thorium  This exposure is raised for people who live near uranium  phosphate  or tin processing factories  thorium deposits  radioactive waste disposal sites  and for those who work in uranium  thorium  tin  or phosphate mining or gas mantle production industries  When thorium is ingested  99 98% does not remain in the body  Out of the thorium that does remain in the body  three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton  While absorption through the skin is possible  it is not a likely means of thorium exposure  Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and often ignites spontaneously in air   Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials  and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin meaning owning and handling small amounts of thorium  such as a gas mantle  is considered safe  Because 232Th is only weakly radioactive  but decays to more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon  emitting alpha and gamma radiation  a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters such as 228Ra  Exposure to an aerosol of thorium  however  can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung  pancreas  and blood  as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation  Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases  Thorium is radioactive and produces a radioactive gas  radon 220  as one of its decay products  Secondary decay products of thorium include radium and actinium  Because of this  there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles  Some nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about their use  Production of gas mantles has led to some safety concerns during manufacture   The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds  mostly the dioxide  are poorly soluble in water  Nevertheless  some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic  People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis  It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves   8  Notes  9  References  10  Bibliography  11  External links    World Nuclear Association  at The Periodic
