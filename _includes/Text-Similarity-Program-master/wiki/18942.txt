Monty Python  sometimes known as The Pythons  were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show Monty Python s Flying Circus  that first aired on the BBC on 5 October 1969  Forty five episodes were made over four series  The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact  spawning touring stage shows  films  numerous albums  several books  and a stage musical  The group s influence on comedy has been compared to The Beatles  influence on music   Broadcast by the BBC between 1969 and 1974  Flying Circus was conceived  written and performed by its members Graham Chapman  John Cleese  Terry Gilliam  Eric Idle  Terry Jones  and Michael Palin  Loosely structured as a sketch show  but with an innovative stream of consciousness approach  aided by Gilliam s animation   it pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content  A self contained comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work  the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment with form and content  discarding rules of television comedy  Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years  while in North America it has coloured the work of cult performers from the early editions of Saturday Night Live through to more recent absurdist trends in television comedy   Pythonesque  has entered the English lexicon as a result   In a 2005 UK poll to find The Comedian s Comedian  three of the six Pythons members were voted by fellow comedians and comedy insiders to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever  Cleese at #2  Idle at #21  and Palin at #30   1  Before Flying Circus  Jones and Palin met at Oxford University  where they performed together with the Oxford Revue  Chapman and Cleese met at Cambridge University  Idle was also at Cambridge  but started a year after Chapman and Cleese  Cleese met Gilliam in New York City while on tour with the Cambridge University Footlights revue Cambridge Circus  originally entitled A Clump of Plinths   Chapman  Cleese and Idle were members of the Footlights  which at that time also included the future Goodies  Tim Brooke Taylor  Bill Oddie  and Graeme Garden   and Jonathan Lynn  co writer of Yes Minister and Yes  Prime Minister   During Idle s presidency of the Club  feminist writer Germaine Greer and broadcaster Clive James were members  Recordings of Footlights revues  called  Smokers   at Pembroke College include sketches and performances by Cleese and Idle  which  along with tapes of Idle s performances in some of the drama society s theatrical productions  are kept in the archives of the Pembroke Players   All six Python members appeared in or wrote the following shows before Flying

 Following the success of Do Not Adjust Your Set  a tea time children s programme  ITV offered Gilliam  Idle  Jones  and Palin their own late night adult comedy series together  At the same time  Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC  which had been impressed by their work on The Frost Report and At Last The 1948 Show  Cleese was reluctant to do a two man show for various reasons  including Chapman s supposedly difficult and erratic personality  Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin and invited him to join the team  With the ITV series still in pre production  Palin agreed and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn suggested that Gilliam could provide animations for the projected series  Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese s desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold   2  Monty Python s Flying Circus  2 1  Development of the series  The Pythons had a definite idea about what they wanted to do with the series  They were admirers of the work of Peter Cook  Alan Bennett  Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore on Beyond the Fringe  and had worked on Frost  which was similar in style  They enjoyed Cook and Moore s sketch show Not Only    But Also  One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong  the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on  and this would detract from the overall sketch quality  They decided that they would simply not bother to  cap  their sketches in the traditional manner  and early episodes of the Flying Circus series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline  one scene has Cleese turn to Idle  as the sketch descends into chaos  and remark that  This is the silliest sketch I ve ever been in —they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set   However  as they began assembling material for the show  the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes  Spike Milligan  recording his groundbreaking series Q5  1969   Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy  Milligan would often  give up  on sketches halfway through and wander off set  often muttering  Did I write this     It was clear that their new series would now seem less original  and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate   After much debate  Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for Do Not Adjust Your Set called  Beware of the Elephants   which had intrigued him with its stream of consciousness style  Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series  allowing sketches to blend into one another  Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam s efforts  entitled  Christmas Cards   and agreed that it represented  a way of doing things differently   Since Cleese  Chapman and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme  it was Jones  Palin and Gilliam who became largely responsible for the presentation style of the Flying Circus series  in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream of consciousness  often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another    Writing started at 9 am and finished at 5 pm  Typically  Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others  as did Jones and Palin  while Idle wrote alone  After a few days  they would join together with Gilliam  critique their scripts  and exchange ideas  Their approach to writing was democratic  If the majority found an idea humorous  it was included in the show  The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process  since each member viewed himself primarily as a  writer   rather than an actor desperate for screen time  When the themes for sketches were chosen  Gilliam had a blank check to decide how to bridge them with animations  using a camera  scissors  and airbrush   While the show was a collaborative process  different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team s humour  In general  the work of the Oxford educated members  Jones and Palin  was more visual  and more fanciful conceptually  e g   the arrival of the Spanish Inquisition in a suburban front room   while the Cambridge graduates  sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive  for example  Cleese and Chapman s many  confrontation  sketches  where one character intimidates or hurls abuse  or Idle s characters with bizarre verbal quirks  such as The Man Who Speaks In Anagrams   Cleese confirmed that  most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham s and mine  anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry s  and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric s   Gilliam s animations  meanwhile  ranged from the whimsical to the savage  the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship    Several names for the show were considered before Monty Python s Flying Circus was settled upon  Some were Owl Stretching Time  The Toad Elevating Moment  A Horse  a Spoon and a Bucket  Vaseline Review  and Bun  Wackett  Buzzard  Stubble and Boot  Flying Circus stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it  Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went  popular legend holds that the BBC considered Monty Python s Flying Circus to be a ridiculous name  at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented   Gwen Dibley s Flying Circus was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper  thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show  Baron Von Took s Flying Circus was considered as an affectionate tribute to Barry Took  the man who had brought them together  Arthur Megapode s Flying Circus was suggested  then discarded  The name Baron Von Took s Flying Circus had the form of Baron Manfred von Richthofen s Flying Circus of WWI fame  and the new group was forming in a time when the Royal Guardsmen s 1966 song Snoopy vs  the Red Baron had peaked  The term  flying circus  was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as barnstorming  where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts   There are differing  somewhat confusing accounts of the origins of the Python name although the members agree that its only  significance  was that they thought it sounded funny  In the 1998 documentary Live At Aspen during the US Comedy Arts Festival  where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute  the group implied that  Monty  was selected  Eric Idle s idea  as a gently mocking tribute to Field Marshal Lord Montgomery  a legendary British general of World War II  requiring a  slippery sounding  surname  they settled on  Python   On other occasions Idle has claimed that the name  Monty  was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub  people would often walk in and ask the barman   Has Monty been in yet    forcing the name to become stuck in his mind  The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being  envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent    2 2  Style of the show  Flying Circus popularised innovative formal techniques  such as the cold open  in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements  An example of this is the  It s  man  Palin  outfitted in Robinson Crusoe garb  making a tortuous journey across various terrains  before finally approaching the camera to state   It s       only to be then cut off by the title sequence and theme music   On several occasions the cold open lasted until mid show  after which the regular opening titles ran  Occasionally the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the closing credits halfway through the show  usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar globe logo used for BBC continuity  over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer  On one occasion the credits ran directly after the opening titles   Because of their dislike of finishing with punchlines  they experimented with ending the sketches by cutting abruptly to another scene or animation  walking offstage  addressing the camera  breaking the fourth wall   or introducing a totally unrelated event or character  A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman s  anti silliness  character of  the Colonel   who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming  far too silly    Another favourite way of ending sketches was to drop a cartoonish  16 ton weight  prop on one of the characters when the sketch seemed to be losing momentum  or a knight in full armour  played by Terry Gilliam  would wander on set and hit characters over the head with a rubber chicken  before cutting to the next scene  Yet another way of changing scenes was when John Cleese  usually outfitted in a dinner suit  would come in as a radio commentator and  in a rather pompous manner  make the formal and determined announcement   And now for something completely different    The phrase became the title of the first Monty Python film    The Python theme music is The Liberty Bell  a march by John Philip Sousa  which was chosen  among other reasons  because the recording was in the public domain   The use of Gilliam s surreal  collage stop motion animations was another innovative intertextual element of the Python style  Many of the images Gilliam used were lifted from famous works of art  and from Victorian illustrations and engravings  The giant foot which crushes the show s title at the end of the opening credits is in fact the foot of Cupid  cut from a reproduction of the Renaissance masterpiece Venus  Cupid  Folly and Time by Bronzino  This foot  and Gilliam s style in general  are visual trademarks of the programme   The Pythons used the British tradition of cross dressing comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in falsetto  Jones was specialized in playing the working class housewife  Palin and Idle being generally more posh  The other members played female roles more sparsely  Generally speaking  female roles were played by women only when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive  although sometimes they used Idle for this   The troupe later turned to Carol Cleveland  who co starred in numerous episodes after 1970  In some episodes and later in Monty Python s Life of Brian they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men  in the stoning scene    Many sketches are well known and widely quoted   Dead Parrot    The Lumberjack Song    Spam   which led to the coining of the term email spam    Nudge Nudge    The Spanish Inquisition    Upper Class Twit of the Year    Cheese Shop   and  The Ministry of Silly Walks  are just a few examples   2 3  Introduction to North America  The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  CBC  added Monty Python s Flying Circus to its national September 1970 fall lineup  They aired the 13 episodes of Series 1  which had first run on the BBC the previous fall  October 1969 to January 1970   as well as the first 6 episodes of Series 2 only a few weeks after they first appeared on the BBC  September to November 1970   The CBC dropped the show when it returned to regular programming after the Christmas 1970 break  choosing to not place the remaining 7 episodes of series 2 on the January 1971 CBC schedule  Within a week the CBC received hundreds of calls complaining of the cancellation  and more than 100 people staged a demonstration at the CBC s Montreal studios  The show eventually returned  becoming a fixture on the network during the first half of the 1970s   Time Life Films had the right to distribute all BBC TV programs in the United States  however they had decided that British comedy simply would not work in America  Therefore  it was not worth the investment to convert the Python episodes from the European PAL standard to the American NTSC standard   Sketches from Monty Python s Flying Circus were introduced to American audiences in August 1972  with the release of the Python movie And Now for Something Completely Different  featuring sketches from series 1 and 2 of the television show  This 1972 release met limited box office success  Sketches like  Bicycle Repairman  and  The Dull Life of a Stockbroker  aired in the summer of 1972 on  Comedyworld   a summer replacement series for NBC s The Dean Martin Show   In the summer of 1974 Ron Devillier  the program director for non profit PBS television station KERA in Dallas  Texas  started airing episodes of Monty Python s Flying Circus  Ratings shot through the roof  providing an encouraging sign to the other 100 PBS stations that had signed up to begin airing the show in October 1974—exactly 5 years after their BBC debut  There was also cross promotion from FM radio stations across the country  whose airing of tracks from the Python LPs had already introduced American audiences to this bizarre brand of comedy  The popularity on PBS resulted in the 1974 re release of the 1972     Completely Different movie  with much greater box office success   The ability to show Monty Python s Flying Circus under the American NTSC standard had been made possible by the commercial actions of American television producer Greg Garrison  Garrison produced the NBC series The Dean Martin Comedy World  which ran during the summer of 1974  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries  including tape of the Python sketches  Bicycle Repairman  and  The Dull Life of a Stockbroker   Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard  allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations who then brought the entire show to US audiences   In 1975 the American Broadcasting Company  ABC  broadcast two ninety minute Monty Python specials  each with three shows  but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each in part to make time for commercial  in part to avoid upsetting their audience  As the judge observed in Gilliam v  American Broadcasting  where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version   According to the network  appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials  which presumably are more palatable to the American public   Monty Python won the case   With the popularity of Python throughout the rest of the 1970s and through most of the 1980s  PBS stations looked at other British comedies  leading to UK shows such as Are You Being Served  gaining a US audience  and leading  over time  to many PBS stations having a  British Comedy Night  which airs many popular UK comedies   2 4  Cleese departs  the circus closes  Having considered the possibility at the end of the second series  Cleese left the Flying Circus at the end of the third  He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show  and claimed that only two Cleese and Chapman penned sketches in the third series   Dennis Moore  and the  Cheese Shop   were truly original  and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts  He was also finding Chapman  who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism  difficult to work with  According to an interview with Idle   It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto  when John  Cleese  turned to all of us and said  I want out   Why  I don t know  He gets bored more easily than the rest of us  He s a difficult man  not easy to be friendly with  He s so funny because he never wanted to be liked  That gives him a certain fascinating  arrogant freedom    The rest of the group carried on for one more  half  series before calling a halt to the programme in 1974  The name Monty Python s Flying Circus appears in the opening animation for series four  but in the end credits the show is listed as simply  Monty Python   Although Cleese left the show  he was credited as a writer for three of the six episodes  largely concentrated in the  Michael Ellis  episode  which had begun life as one of the many drafts of the  Holy Grail  motion picture  When a new direction for  Grail  was decided upon  the subplot of Arthur and his knights wandering around a strange department store in modern times was lifted out and recycled as the aforementioned TV episode   While the first three series contained 13 episodes each  the fourth ended after just six  Extremely keen to keep the now massively popular show going  the BBC had offered the troupe a full 13 episodes  but the truncated troupe  now under the unspoken  leadership  of Terry Jones  had come to a common agreement while writing the fourth season that there was only enough material  and more importantly only enough enthusiasm  to shoot the six that were made   3  Life after the Flying Circus  3 1  Filmography  3 1 1  And Now for Something Completely Different  1971   The Pythons  first feature film was directed by Ian MacNaughton  reprising his role from the television series  It was composed of sketches from the first two seasons of the Flying Circus  reshot on a low budget  and often slightly edited  for cinema release  Material selected for the film includes   Dead Parrot    The Lumberjack Song    Upper Class Twit of the Year    Hell s Grannies    Self Defence Class    How Not To Be Seen  and  Nudge Nudge   Financed by Playboy s UK executive Victor Lownes  it was intended as a way of breaking Monty Python into America  and although it was ultimately unsuccessful in this  the film did good business in the UK  this being in the era before home video would make the original material much more accessible  The group did not consider the film a success   3 1 2  Monty Python and the Holy Grail  1975   In 1974  between production on the third and fourth seasons  the group decided to embark on their first  proper  feature film  containing entirely new material  Monty Python and the Holy Grail was based on Arthurian legend and was directed by Jones and Gilliam  Again  the latter also contributed linking animations  and put together the opening credits   Along with the rest of the Pythons  Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film  but it was Chapman who took the lead as King Arthur  Cleese returned to the group for the film  feeling that the group were once again breaking new ground  Holy Grail was filmed on location  in picturesque rural areas of Scotland  with a budget of only £229 000  the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as Pink Floyd  Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin—and UK music industry entrepreneur Tony Stratton Smith  founder and owner of the Charisma Records label  for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums    The backers of the film wanted to cut the famous Black Knight scene  in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel  but it was eventually kept in the movie   3 1 3  Monty Python s Life of Brian  1979   Following the success of Holy Grail  reporters asked for the title of the next Python film  despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one  Eventually  Idle flippantly replied  Jesus Christ – Lust for Glory   which became the group s stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up  However  they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way Holy Grail had lampooned Arthurian legend  Despite them all sharing a distrust of organised religion  they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly  They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him  Instead  they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone who had been mistaken for the  Messiah   but who had no desire to be followed as such  Chapman was cast in the lead role of Brian   The focus therefore shifted to a separate individual born at the same time  in a neighbouring stable  When Jesus appears in the film  first  as a baby in the stable  and then later on the Mount  speaking the Beatitudes   he is played straight  by actor Kenneth Colley  and portrayed with respect  The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace  love and tolerance    I think he said   Blessed are the cheesemakers      Directing duties were handled solely by Jones  having amicably agreed with Gilliam that Jones  approach to film making was better suited for Python s general performing style  Holy Grail s production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera  Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences  one being the opening credits  and took charge of set design  The film was shot on location in Tunisia  the finances being provided this time by former Beatle George Harrison  who together with Denis O Brien formed the production company Hand Made Films for the movie  Harrison had a cameo role as the  owner of the Mount    Despite its subject matter attracting controversy  particularly upon its initial release  it has  together with its predecessor  been ranked among the greatest comedy films  A Channel 4 poll in 2005 ranked Holy Grail in sixth place  with Life of Brian at the top   3 1 4  Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl  1982   Filmed at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles during preparations for The Meaning of Life  this was a concert film  directed by Terry Hughes  in which the Pythons performed sketches from the television series in front of an audience  The released film also incorporated footage from the German television specials  the inclusion of which gives Ian MacNaughton his first on screen credit for Python since the end of Flying Circus  and live performances of several songs from the troupe s then current Monty Python s Contractual Obligation Album   3 1 5  Monty Python s The Meaning of Life  1983   Python s final film returned to something structurally closer to the style of Flying Circus  A series of sketches loosely follows the ages of man from birth to death  Directed again by Jones solo  The Meaning of Life is embellished with some of Python s most bizarre and disturbing moments  as well as various elaborate musical numbers  The film is by far their darkest work  containing a great deal of black humour  garnished by some spectacular violence  including an operation to remove a liver from a living patient without anaesthetic and the morbidly obese Mr  Creosote exploding over several restaurant patrons   At the time of its release  the Pythons confessed their aim was to offend  absolutely everyone    Besides the opening credits and the fish sequence  Gilliam  by now an established live action director  no longer wanted to produce any linking cartoons  offering instead to direct one sketch—The Crimson Permanent Assurance  Under his helm  though  the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right   Television screenings also use it as a prologue   Crucially  this was the last project that all six Pythons would collaborate on  except for the 1989 compilation Parrot Sketch Not Included  where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds  This was the last time Chapman appeared on screen with the Pythons   3 2  Secret Policeman s Ball benefit shows  Members of Python contributed their services to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble  at other times as individuals  The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of Amnesty International  Between 1976 and 1981  the troupe or its members appeared in four major fund raisers for Amnesty—known collectively as the Secret Policeman s Ball shows—which were turned into multiple films  TV shows  videos  record albums and books  These benefit shows and their many spin offs raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty  raised public and media awareness of the human rights cause and influenced many other members of the entertainment community  especially rock musicians  to become involved in political and social issues  Among the many musicians who have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own benefit events—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Monty Python are U2  Bob Geldof  Pete Townshend and Sting  The shows are credited by Amnesty with helping the organisation develop public awareness in the US where one of the spin off films was a major success   Cleese and Jones had an involvement  as performer  writer or director  in all four Amnesty benefit shows  Palin in three  Chapman in two and Gilliam in one  Idle did not participate in the Amnesty shows  Notwithstanding Idle s lack of participation  the other five members  together with  Associate Pythons  Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes  all appeared together in the first Secret Policeman s Ball benefit—the 1976 A Poke In The Eye  With A Sharp Stick —where they performed several Python sketches  In this first show they were collectively billed as Monty Python   Peter Cook deputised for the errant Idle in a courtroom sketch   In the next three shows  the participating Python members performed many Python sketches  but were billed under their individual names rather than under the collective Python banner  After a six year break  Amnesty resumed producing Secret Policeman s Ball benefit shows in 1987  sometimes with  and sometimes without variants of the iconic title  and by 2006 had presented a total of twelve such shows  The shows since 1987 have featured newer generations of British comedic performers  including many who have attributed their participation in the show to their desire to emulate the Python s pioneering work for Amnesty   Cleese and Palin made a brief cameo appearance in the 1989 Amnesty show  apart from that the Pythons have not appeared in shows after the first four    3 3  Going solo  Each member has pursued various film  television and stage projects since the break up of the group  but often continued to work with one another  Many of these collaborations were very successful  most notably A Fish Called Wanda  1988   written by Cleese  in which he starred along with Palin  The pair also appeared in Time Bandits  1981   a film directed by Gilliam  who wrote it together with Palin  Gilliam directed Jabberwocky  1977   and also directed and co wrote Brazil  1985   which featured Palin  and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen  1988   which featured Idle  Yellowbeard  1983  was co written by Chapman and featured Chapman  Idle  and Cleese as well as many other English comedians including Peter Cook  Spike Milligan and Marty Feldman   Palin and Jones wrote the comedic TV series Ripping Yarns  1976–79   starring Palin  Jones also appeared in the pilot episode and Cleese appeared in a non speaking part in the episode  Golden Gordon   Jones  film Erik the Viking also has Cleese playing a small part   In 1996  Terry Jones wrote and directed an adaption of Kenneth Grahame s novel The Wind in the Willows  It featured four members of Monty Python  Jones as Mr  Toad  Idle as Ratty  Cleese as Mr  Toad s lawyer  and Palin as the Sun  Gilliam was considered for the voice of the river   In terms of numbers of productions  Cleese has the most prolific solo career  having appeared in 59 films  22 TV shows or series  including Cheers  3rd Rock from the Sun  Q s assistant in the James Bond movies  and Will & Grace   23 direct to video productions  six video games  and a number of commercials  His BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers  written by and starring Cleese together with his then wife Connie Booth  is considered the greatest solo work by a Python since the sketch show finished  It is the only comedy series to rank higher than the Flying Circus on the BFI TV 100 s list  topping the whole poll   Idle enjoyed critical success with Rutland Weekend Television in the mid 1970s  out of which came the Beatles parody The Rutles  responsible for the cult mockumentary All You Need Is Cash   and as an actor in Nuns on the Run  1990  with Robbie Coltrane  Idle has had success with Python songs   Always Look on the Bright Side of Life  went to no  3 in the UK singles chart in 1991  The song had been revived by Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 1  and was consequently released as a single that year  The theatrical phenomenon of the Python musical Spamalot has made Idle the most financially successful of the troupe post Python  Written by Idle  it has proved an enormous hit on Broadway  London s West End and also Las Vegas  This was followed by Not the Messiah  He s a Very Naughty Boy   which repurposes The Life of Brian as an oratorio  For the work s 2007 premiere at the Luminato festival in Toronto  which commissioned the work   Idle himself sang the  baritone ish  part   3 4  Post Python reunions  Since The Meaning of Life  their last project as a team  the Pythons have often been the subject of reunion rumours  The final reunion of all six members occurred during the Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python special  The death of Chapman in 1989  on the eve of their 20th anniversary  put an end to the speculation of any further reunions  There have been several occasions since 1989 when the surviving five members have gathered together for appearances—albeit not formal reunions   In 1996  Jones  Idle  Cleese and Palin were featured in a film adaptation of The Wind in the Willows  which was later renamed Mr  Toad s Wild Ride   In 1998 during the US Comedy Arts Festival  where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute  the five remaining members along with what was purported to be Chapman s ashes  were reunited on stage for the first time in 18 years  The occasion was in the form of an interview called Monty Python Live at Aspen   hosted by Robert Klein  with an appearance by Eddie Izzard  in which the team looked back at some of their work and performed a few new sketches   On 9 October 1999  to commemorate 30 years since the first Flying Circus television broadcast  BBC2 devoted an evening to Python programmes  including a documentary charting the history of the team  interspersed with new sketches by the Monty Python team filmed especially for the event  The program appears  with a few omissions  on the DVD The Life of Python  Idle s involvement in the special is limited  yet the final sketch marks the only time since 1989 that all surviving members of the troupe appear in one sketch  albeit not in the same room   The surviving Pythons had agreed in principle to perform a live tour of America in 1999  Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities  Although all had said yes  Palin later changed his mind  much to the annoyance of Idle  who had begun work organising the tour  This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening   In 2002  four of the surviving members  bar Cleese  performed  The Lumberjack Song  and  Sit on My Face  for George Harrison s memorial concert  The reunion also included regular supporting contributors Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland  with a special appearance from Tom Hanks   In an interview to publicise the DVD release of The Meaning of Life  Cleese said a further reunion was unlikely   It is absolutely impossible to get even a majority of us together in a room  and I m not joking   Cleese said  He said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings  A sketch appears on the same DVD spoofing the impossibility of a full reunion  bringing the members  together  in a deliberately unconvincing fashion with modern bluescreen greenscreen techniques   Idle has responded to queries about a Python reunion by adapting a line used by George Harrison in response to queries about a possible Beatles reunion  When asked in November 1989 about such a possibility  Harrison responded   As far as I m concerned  there won t be a Beatles reunion as long as John Lennon remains dead   Idle s version of this was that he expected to see a proper Python reunion   just as soon as Graham Chapman comes back from the dead   but added   we re talking to his agent about terms    2003 s The Pythons Autobiography By the Pythons  compiled from interviews with the surviving members  reveals that a series of disputes in 1998  over a possible sequel to Holy Grail that had been conceived by Idle  may have resulted in the group s permanent split  Cleese s feeling was that The Meaning of Life had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre  and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons  not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman  whose straight man like central roles in the Grail and Brian films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance   Apparently Idle was angry with Cleese for refusing to do the film  which most of the remaining Pythons thought reasonably promising  the basic plot would have taken on a self referential tone  featuring them in their main  knight  guises from Holy Grail  mulling over the possibilities of reforming their posse   The book also reveals that a secondary option around this point was the possibility of revitalising the Python brand with a new stage tour  perhaps with the promise of new material  This idea had also met with Cleese s refusal  this time with the backing of other members   March 2005 saw a full  if non performing  reunion of the surviving cast members at the premiere of Idle s musical Spamalot  based on Monty Python and the Holy Grail  It opened in Chicago and has since played in New York on Broadway  London and numerous other major cities across the world  In 2004  it was nominated for 14 Tony Awards and won three  Best Musical  Best Direction of a Musical for Mike Nichols and Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for Sara Ramirez  who played the Lady of the Lake  a character specially added for the musical  Cleese played the voice of God  played in the film by Chapman   Owing in part to the success of Spamalot  PBS announced on 13 July 2005 that it would begin to re air the entire run of Monty Python s Flying Circus and new one hour specials focusing on each member of the group  called Monty Python s Personal Best  Each episode was written and produced by the individual being honoured  with the five remaining Pythons collaborating on Chapman s programme  the only one of the editions to take on a serious tone with its new material   Eric Idle and John Cleese appeared on stage at the end of We Are Most Amused  Idle sang  Always Look on the Bright Side of Life  with the rest of the performers  including Cleese  for the climax  Idle added a couplet dedicated to the Prince of Wales    If Spamalot is hot And you like it  or per aps not  A bunch of knights in search of Holy Grails  When you re 60 years of age And your mum won t leave the stage  It s good to know that you re still Prince of Wales  In 2009  to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the first episode of Monty Python s Flying Circus  a six part documentary entitled Monty Python  Almost the Truth  Lawyers Cut  was released  featuring interviews with the surviving members of the team as well as archive interviews with Graham Chapman and numerous excerpts from the television series and films   Also in commemoration of the 40th anniversary  Idle  Palin  Jones and Gilliam appeared in a production of Not the Messiah  He s a Very Naughty Boy  at the Royal Albert Hall  The European premiere was held on 23 October 2009  An official 40th anniversary Monty Python reunion event took place in New York City on 15 October 2009 where the team received a Special Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts   In June 2011  it was announced that A Liar s Autobiography  an animated 3D movie based on the memoir of the late Python member  Graham Chapman  was in the making  The book A Liar s Autobiography was published in 1980 and details Chapman s journey through medical school  alcoholism  acknowledgement of his gay identity and the tolls of surreal comedy  Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life  Terry Jones joked   Nothing     it s all a downright  absolute  blackguardly lie    The film uses Chapman s own voice – from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer – and entertainment channel Epix announced that the film will be released in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats  Produced and directed by London based Bill Jones  Ben Timlett and Jeff Simpson  the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length  each in a different style   John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman s voice  Michael Palin voiced Chapman s father and Terry Jones voiced his mother  Terry Gilliam voiced Graham s psychiatrist  They all play various other roles  Among the original Python group  only Eric Idle was not involved   On 26 January 2012  Terry Jones announced that the five surviving Pythons would reunite in a sci fi comedy film called Absolutely Anything  The film would combine CGI and live action  It would be directed by Jones based on a script by Jones and Gavin Scott  The plot revolves around a teacher who discovers aliens  voiced by the Pythons  have given him magical powers to do  absolutely anything   Eric Idle responded via Twitter that he would not  in fact  be participating   although he was later added to the cast   3 5  Monty Python Live  Mostly   One Down  Five to Go  In 2013 the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater  the film producer of Monty Python and the Holy Grail  over royalties for the derivative work Spamalot  They owed a combined £800 000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater  They proposed a reunion show to pay their legal bill   On 19 November 2013  a new reunion was reported  following months of  secret talks   The original plan was for a live  one off stage show at the O2 Arena in London on 1 July 2014  with  some of Monty Python s greatest hits  with modern  topical  Pythonesque twists  according to a press release  The official website of the event is  www montypythonlive com   The tickets for this show went on sale in November 2013 and sold out in just 43 seconds  Nine additional shows were added  all of them at the O2  the last on 20 July  They have said that their reunion was inspired by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are massive Monty Python fans   Michael Palin stated that the final reunion show on 20 July would be the last time that the troupe would perform together  The event was first shown live from the UK nationwide and was titled Monty Python Live  Mostly  and was later re shown at select theatres in recorded form in August   4  Python members  Graham Chapman was originally a medical student  joining the Footlights at Cambridge  He completed his medical training and was legally entitled to practice as a doctor  Chapman is best remembered for the lead roles in Holy Grail  as King Arthur  and Life of Brian  as Brian Cohen  He died of spinal and throat cancer on 4 October 1989  At Chapman s memorial service  Cleese delivered an irreverent eulogy that included all the euphemisms for being dead from the Dead Parrot sketch  which they had written  Chapman s comedic fictional memoir  A Liar s Autobiography was adapted into an animated 3D movie in 2012   John Cleese is the oldest Python  He met his future Python writing partner  Graham Chapman  in Cambridge  Outside of Python he is best known for setting up the Video Arts group and the widely revered though short lived sitcom Fawlty Towers  co written with Connie Booth who Cleese met during work on Python and briefly married   Cleese has also co authored several books on psychology and wrote the screenplay for the award winning A Fish Called Wanda  in which he starred with Michael Palin   Terry Gilliam  an American by birth  is the only member of the troupe of non British origin  He started off as an animator and strip cartoonist for Harvey Kurtzman s Help  magazine  one issue of which featured Cleese  Moving from the US to England  he animated features for Do Not Adjust Your Set and was then asked by its makers to join them on their next project  Monty Python s Flying Circus  He co directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail and directed short segments of other Python films  for instance  The Crimson Permanent Assurance   the short film that appears before The Meaning of Life    When Monty Python was first formed  two writing partnerships were already in place  Cleese and Chapman  Jones and Palin  That left two in their own corners  Gilliam  operating solo due to the nature of his work  and Eric Idle  Regular themes in Idle s contributions were elaborate wordplay and musical numbers  After Flying Circus  he hosted Saturday Night Live four times in the first five seasons  Idle s initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film Splitting Heirs  written  produced by and starring him  and 1998 s An Alan Smithee Film  Burn Hollywood Burn  in which he starred   which was awarded five Razzies  including  Worst Picture of the Year   He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame  adapting Monty Python material for other media  He also wrote the Broadway musical Spamalot  based on the Holy Grail movie  He also wrote Not the Messiah  He s a Very Naughty Boy   an oratorio derived from the Life of Brian   Terry Jones has been described by other members of the team as the  heart  of the operation  Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group s unity and creative independence  Python biographer George Perry has commented that should you  speak to him on subjects as diverse as fossil fuels  or Rupert Bear  or mercenaries in the Middle Ages or Modern China     in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth  floored by his knowledge   Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible  good natured enthusiasm  However  Jones  passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members—in particular Cleese—with Jones often unwilling to back down  Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes  direction  writing   and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor  Jones  importance to Python was often underrated  However  he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python  as Brian s mother Mandy in Life of Brian   He s not the Messiah  he s a very naughty boy    a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions   Michael Palin attended Oxford  where he met his Python writing partner Jones  The two also wrote the series Ripping Yarns together  Palin and Jones originally wrote face to face  but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written  Therefore  Jones and Palin s sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others  taking one bizarre situation  sticking to it  and building on it  After Flying Circus  he hosted Saturday Night Live four times in the first ten seasons  His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC  Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979  published in 2007   4 1  Associate Pythons  Several people have been accorded unofficial  Associate Python  status over the years  Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 7th Python  in a style reminiscent of George Martin  or other associates of The Beatles  being dubbed  the Fifth Beatle   The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland  Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994  Neil Innes is the only non Python besides Douglas Adams to be credited with writing material for Flying Circus  He appeared in sketches and the Python films  as well as performing some of his songs in Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl  He was also a regular stand in for absent team members on the rare occasions when they re created sketches  For example  he took the place of Cleese at the Concert for George  Gilliam once noted that if anyone qualified for the title of the  Seventh Python   it would certainly be Innes  He was one of the creative talents in the off beat Bonzo Dog Band  He would later portray Ron Nasty of the Rutles and write all of the Rutles  compositions for All You Need Is Cash  1978   By 2005  a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects  the results being Innes  critically acclaimed Rutles  reunion  album The Rutles  Archaeology and Idle s straight to DVD The Rutles 2  Can t Buy Me Lunch  each undertaken without the other s participation  According to an interview with Idle in the Chicago Tribune in May 2005  his attitude is that he and Innes go back  too far  And no further   Innes has remained silent on the dispute   Carol Cleveland was the most important female performer in the Monty Python ensemble  commonly referred to as the  Python Girl   Originally hired by producer director John Howard Davies for just the first five episodes of the Flying Circus  she went on to appear in approximately two thirds of the episodes as well as in all of the Python films  and in most of their stage shows as well  Her common portrayal as the stereotypical  blonde bimbo  eventually earned her the sobriquet  Carol Cleavage  from the other Pythons  but she felt that the variety of her roles should not be described in such a pejorative way   4 2  Other contributors  Cleese s first wife Connie Booth appeared as various characters in all four series of Flying Circus  Her most significant role was the  best girl  of the Lumberjack in The Lumberjack Song  though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland  Booth appeared in a total of 6 sketches and also played one off characters in Python feature films  And Now for Something Completely Different and Monty Python and the Holy Grail   Douglas Adams was  discovered  by Chapman when a version of Footlights Revue  a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams  early work  was performed live in London s West End  In Cleese s absence from the final TV series  the two formed a brief writing partnership  with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called  Patient Abuse   In the sketch  a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor s office bleeding profusely from the stomach  when the doctor makes him fill out numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment  He also had two cameo appearances in this season  Firstly  in the episode The Light Entertainment War  Adams shows up in a surgeon s mask  as Dr  Emile Koning  according to the on screen captions   pulling on gloves  while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another  and never actually gets started  Secondly  at the beginning of Mr  Neutron  Adams is dressed in a  pepperpot  outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones  who is calling out for scrap metal   Any old iron        Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non Python projects  including Out of the Trees  He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for Monty Python and the Holy Grail   Other than Carol Cleveland  the only other non Python to make a significant amount of appearances in the Flying Circus was Ian Davidson  He appeared in the first two series of the show  and played over 10 roles  While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter  it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches  as he is only credited as a performer  In total Davidson is credited as appearing in 8 episodes of the show  which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python  Despite this  Davidson did not appear in any Python related media subsequent to series 2  though footage of him was shown on the documentary Python Night – 30 Years of Monty Python   Stand up comedian Eddie Izzard  a devoted fan of the group  has occasionally stood in for absent members  When the BBC held a  Python Night  in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of Flying Circus  the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle  who had declined to partake in person  he taped a solo contribution from the US   Izzard hosted a history of the group entitled The Life of Python  1999  that was part of the Python Night and appeared with them at a festival tribute in Aspen  Colorado  in 1998  released on DVD as Live at Aspen   Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy   Series director of Flying Cirus  Ian MacNaughton is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on screen appearances in the show and in the film And Now for Something Completely Different  Apart from Neil Innes  others to contribute musically included Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers  They made appearances in songs such as the  Lumberjack Song  as a backup choir  As well as this various other contributors and performers for the Pythons included  John Howard Davies  John Hughman  Lyn Ashley  Bob Raymond  John Young  Rita Davies  Stanley Mason  Maureen Flanagan and David Ballantyne   4 3  Timeline  ImageSize   width 800 height 300 PlotArea   left 100 bottom 60 top 0 right 50

London  UK   5  Cultural influence  By the time of the twenty fifth anniversary of Monty Python in 1994  the point was already being made that  the five surviving members had with the passing years begun to occupy an institutional position in the edifice of British social culture that they had once had so much fun trying to demolish   A similar point is made in a 2006 book on the relationship between Monty and philosophy   It is remarkable  after all  not only that the utterly bizarre Monty Python s Flying Circus was sponsored by the BBC in the first place  but that Monty Python itself grew into an institution of enormous cultural influence   Matt Groening  creator and co developer of the animated sitcom The Simpsons  names Monty Python as an influence and pays tribute through a couch gag used in seasons five and six   Monty Python has been named as being influential to the comedy stylings of a great many people including Seth Meyers  Trey Parker  Matt Stone  Sacha Baron Cohen  Vic and Bob  David Cross  and Seth MacFarlane   5 1  Space  The asteroid 13681 Monty Python is named after the group show   In 2010  the commercial space company SpaceX  launched a wheel of cheese into low earth orbit and returned it safely to the earth  Elon Musk  CEO and CTO of SpaceX  claimed this was done as a tribute to Monty Python   5 2  World records  On St George s Day  23 April 2007  the cast and creators of Spamalot gathered in Trafalgar Square under the tutelage of the two Terrys  Jones and Gilliam  to set a new record for the world s largest coconut orchestra  They led 5 567 people  clip clopping  in time to the Python classic  Always Look On The Bright Side of Life  for the Guinness World Records attempt   5 3   Pythonesque   Amongst the more visible cultural influences of Monty Python is the inclusion of terms either directly from  or derived from  Monty Python  into the lexicon of the English language  The most obvious of these is the term  pythonesque   which has become a byword in surreal humour  and is included in standard dictionaries  Terry Jones commented on his disappointment at the existence of such a term  claiming the initial aim of Monty Python was to create something new and impossible to categorize and that  the fact that Pythonesque is now a word in the Oxford English Dictionary shows the extent to which we failed    The term has been applied to animations similar to those constructed by Gilliam  e g  the cut out style of South Park  whose creators have often acknowledged a debt to Python  including contributing material to the aforementioned 30th anniversary theme night    Good Eats creator Alton Brown cited Python as one of the influences that shaped how he created the series  as well as how he authors the script for each episode  Recent episodes even include Gilliam style animations to illustrate key points   5 4  Things named after Monty Python  Beyond a dictionary definition  Python terms have entered the lexicon in other ways   The Python programming language by Guido van Rossum is named after the troupe  and Monty Python references are often found in sample code created for that language  The programming language development environment is named IDLE  Additionally  a 2001 April Fool s Day joke by van Rossum and Larry Wall involving the merger of Python with Perl was dubbed  Parrot  after the Dead Parrot Sketch  The name  Parrot  was later used for a project to develop a virtual machine for running bytecode for interpreted languages such as Perl and Python  Its package index is also known as the  Cheese Shop  after the sketch of the same name  There is also a python refactoring tool called bicyclerepair named after Bicycle Repair Man sketch   In 1985  a fossil of a previously unknown species of gigantic prehistoric snake from the Miocene was discovered in Riversleigh  Queensland  Australia  The Australian palaeontologist who discovered the fossil snake was a Monty Python fan  and he gave the snake the taxonomic name of Montypythonoides riversleighensis in honour of the Monty Python team   Transliterated from Greek Μοντυπυθωνοειδής back to English  Montypythonoides means  like Monty Python     In 2006  Ben & Jerry s  known for their  celebrity flavours   introduced to the lineup  Vermonty Python   a coffee liqueur ice cream with a chocolate cookie crumb swirl and fudge cows  The name  Minty Python  had been suggested before in 1996 in a contest to select the quintessential British ice cream flavor   In 1999  Black Sheep Brewery released an ale named  Monty Python s Holy Grail Ale    The band Toad the Wet Sprocket drew its name from the Eric Idle monologue  Rock Notes  on Monty Python s Contractual Obligation Album from 1980   The band Boxhamsters  which is the German translation of Brook Hamster  the winner of the Upper Class Twit of the Year   A philosophy lecture series entitled Themes in Contemporary Analytic Philosophy as Reflected in the Work of Monty Python   The term  spam  in reference to bulk  unsolicited email is derived from the programme s 1970  Spam  sketch   In the book The Reptile Room by  Lemony Snicket   the character Uncle Monty was named after Monty Python  in a joke referring to his obsession with snakes   Seven asteroids are named after Monty Python  9617 Grahamchapman  9618 Johncleese  9619 Terrygilliam  9620 Ericidle  9621 Michaelpalin  9622 Terryjones  and 13681 Monty Python   The endangered Bemaraha woolly lemur  Avahi cleesei  is named after John Cleese   Dead Parrot Society is the title of a comedy CD released in 1993 featuring sketches from Monty Python s Flying Circus as well as Graham Chapman  Peter Cook  John Cleese  Dudley Moore  and The Portsmouth Sinfonia  The title is also a play on the 1989 film
