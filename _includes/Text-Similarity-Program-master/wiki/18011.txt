The Lombards or Langobards    Italian Longobardi   were a Germanic tribe who ruled Italy from 568 to 774   The Lombard historian Paul the Deacon wrote in the Historia Langobardorum that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili who dwelt in southern Scandinavia  Scadanan  before migrating to seek new lands  In the 1st century AD they formed part of the Suebi  in northwestern Germany  By the end of the 5th century they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria north of the Danube river  where they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids  The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552  his successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids at the Battle of Asfeld in 567   Following this victory  Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy  which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War  535–554  between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom there  The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons  Heruls  Gepids  Bulgars  Thuringians  and Ostrogoths  and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed  By late 569 they had conquered all the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia  which fell in 572  At the same time  they occupied areas in central and southern Italy  They established a Lombard Kingdom in Italy  later named Regnum Italicum   Kingdom of Italy    which reached its zenith under the 8th century ruler Liutprand  In 774  the Kingdom was conquered by the Frankish King Charlemagne and integrated into his Empire  However  Lombard nobles continued to rule parts of the Italian peninsula well into the 11th century when they were conquered by the Normans and added to their County of Sicily  Their legacy is apparent in the regional name  Lombardy   1  History  1 1  Early history  1 2  Legendary origins and name  The fullest account of Lombard origins  history  and practices is the Historia Langobardorum  History of the Lombards  of Paul the Deacon  written in the 8th century  Paul s chief source for Lombard origins  however  is the 7th century Origo Gentis Langobardorum  Origin of the Lombard People    The Origo Gentis Langobardorum tells the story of a small tribe called the Winnili dwelling in southern Scandinavia  Scadanan   the Codex Gothanus writes that the Winnili first dwelt near a river called Vindilicus on the extreme boundary of Gaul   The Winnili were split into three groups and one part left their native land to seek foreign fields  The reason for the exodus was probably overpopulation  The departing people were led by the brothers Ybor and Aio and their mother Gambara and arrived in the lands of Scoringa  perhaps the Baltic coast or the Bardengau on the banks of the Elbe  Scoringa was ruled by the Vandals and their chieftains  the brothers Ambri and Assi  who granted the Winnili a choice between tribute or war   The Winnili were young and brave and refused to pay tribute  saying  It is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute   The Vandals prepared for war and consulted Godan  the god Odin   who answered that he would give the victory to those whom he would see first at sunrise  The Winnili were fewer in number and Gambara sought help from Frea  the goddess Frigg   who advised that all Winnili women should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and march in line with their husbands  So Godan spotted the Winnili first and asked   Who are these long beards    and Frea replied   My lord  thou hast given them the name  now give them also the victory   From that moment onwards  the Winnili were known as the Longbeards  Latinised as Langobardi  Italianised as Lombardi  and Anglicized as Lombards    When Paul the Deacon wrote the Historia between 787 and 796 he was a Catholic monk and devoted Christian  He thought the pagan stories of his people  silly  and  laughable   Paul explained that the name  Langobard  came from the length of their beards  A modern theory suggests that the name  Langobard  comes from Langbarðr  a name of Odin  Priester states that when the Winnili changed their name to  Lombards   they also changed their old agricultural fertility cult to a cult of Odin  thus creating a conscious tribal tradition  Fröhlich inverts the order of events in Priester and states that with the Odin cult  the Lombards grew their beards in resemblance of the Odin of tradition and their new name reflected this  Bruckner remarks that the name of the Lombards stands in close relation to the worship of Odin  whose many names include  the Long bearded  or  the Grey bearded   and that the Lombard given name Ansegranus   he with the beard of the gods   shows that the Lombards had this idea of their chief deity   1 2 1  Archaeology and migrations  The first mention of the Lombards occurred between AD 9 and 16  by the Roman court historian Velleius Paterculus  who accompanied a Roman expedition as prefect of the cavalry  Paterculus says that under Tiberius the  power of the Langobardi was broken  a race surpassing even the Germans in savagery    From the combined testimony of Strabo  AD 20  and Tacitus  AD 117   the Lombards dwelt near the mouth of the Elbe shortly after the beginning of the Christian era  next to the Chauci  Strabo states that the Lombards dwelt on both sides of the Elbe  He treats them as a branch of the Suebi  and states that  Now as for the tribe of the Suebi  it is the largest  for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis  and a part of them even dwell on the far side of the Albis  as  for instance  the Hermondori and the Langobardi  and at the present time these latter  at least  have  to the last man  been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river  The German archaeologist Willi Wegewitz defined several Iron Age burial sites at the Lower Elbe as Langobardic  The burial sites are crematorial and are usually dated from the 6th century BC through the 3rd century AD  so a settlement breakoff seems unlikely  The lands of the lower Elbe fall into the zone of the Jastorf Culture and became Elbe Germanic  differing from the lands between Rhine  Weser  and the North Sea  Archaeological finds show that the Lombards were an agricultural people   Tacitus also counted the Lombards as a remote and aggressive Suebian tribe  one of those united in worship of the deity Nerthus  who he referred to as  Mother Earth   and also as subjects of Marobod the King of the Marcomanni  Marobod had made peace with the Romans  and that is why the Lombards were not part of the Germanic confederacy under Arminius at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9  In AD 17  war broke out between Arminius and Marobod  Tacitus records   In 47  a struggle ensued amongst the Cherusci and they expelled their new leader  the nephew of Arminius  from their country  The Lombards appeared on the scene with sufficient power to control the destiny of the tribe that had been the leader in the struggle for independence thirty eight years earlier  for they restored the deposed leader to sovereignty again   To the south  Cassius Dio reported that just before the Marcomannic Wars  6 000 Lombards and Obii  sometimes thought to be Ubii   crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia  The two tribes were defeated  whereupon they desisted from their invasion and sent Ballomar  King of the Marcomanni  as ambassador to Aelius Bassus  who was then administering Pannonia  Peace was made and the two tribes returned to their homes  which in the case of the Lombards was the lands of the lower Elbe  At about this time  in his Germania Tacitus says that  their scanty numbers are a distinction  because  surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes  they are safe  not by submitting  but by daring the perils of war    In the mid 2nd century  the Lombards apparently appeared in the Rhineland  because according to Claudius Ptolemy  the Suebic Lombards lived  below  the Bructeri and Sugambri  and between these and the Tencteri  To their east stretching northwards to the central Elbe are the Suebi Angili  But Ptolemy also mentions the  Laccobardi  to the north of the above mentioned Suebic territories  east of the Angrivarii on the Weser  and south of the Chauci on the coast  probably indicating a Lombard expansion from the Elbe to the Rhine  This double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Schütte  in his analysis of Ptolemy  However  the Codex Gothanus also mentions Patespruna  Paderborn  in connection with the Lombards   From the 2nd century onwards  many of the Germanic tribes recorded as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions  such as the Franks  Alamanni  Bavarii  and Saxons  The Lombards are not mentioned at first  perhaps because they were not initially upon the border of Rome  or perhaps because they were subjected to a larger tribal union  like the Saxons  It is  however  highly probable that when the bulk of the Lombards migrated  a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region  while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards  However  the Codex Gothanus states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king  Agelmund  who ruled for thirty years  In the second half of the 4th century  the Lombards left their homes  probably due to bad harvests  and embarked on their migration   The migration route of the Lombards in 489  from their homeland to  Rugiland   encompassed several places  Scoringa  believed to be the their land on the Elbe shores   Mauringa  Golanda  Anthaib  Banthaib  and Vurgundaib  Burgundaib   According to the Ravenna Cosmography  Mauringa was the land east of the Elbe   The crossing into Mauringa was very difficult  The Assipitti  possibly the Usipetes  denied them passage through their lands and a fight was arranged for the strongest man of each tribe  The Lombard was victorious  passage was granted  and the Lombards reached Mauringa   The Lombards departed from Mauringa and reached Golanda  Scholar Ludwig Schmidt thinks this was further east  perhaps on the right bank of the Oder  Schmidt considers the name the equivalent of Gotland  meaning simply  good land   This theory is highly plausible  Paul the Deacon mentions the Lombards crossing a river  and they could have reached Rugiland from the Upper Oder area via the Moravian Gate   Moving out of Golanda  the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib  believed to be the old lands of the Burgundes  In Vurgundaib  the Lombards were stormed in camp by  Bulgars   probably Huns  and were defeated  King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king  He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund  The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter  gaining great booty and confidence as they  became bolder in undertaking the toils of war    In the 540s  Audoin  ruled 546–560  led the Lombards across the Danube once more into Pannonia  where they received Imperial subsidies as Justinian encouraged them to battle the Gepids   1 3  Kingdom in Italy  568舑774  1 3 1  Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula  In 560  Audoin was succeeded by his son Alboin  a young and energetic leader who defeated the neighboring Gepidae and made them his subjects  in 566  he married Rosamund  daughter of the Gepid king Cunimund  In the spring of 568  Alboin led the Lombard migration into Italy   Various other people who either voluntarily joined or were subjects of King Alboin were also part of the migration   The first important city to fall was Forum Iulii  Cividale del Friuli  in northeastern Italy  in 569  There  Alboin created the first Lombard duchy  which he entrusted to his nephew Gisulf  Soon Vicenza  Verona and Brescia fell into Germanic hands  In the summer of 569  the Lombards conquered the main Roman centre of northern Italy  Milan  The area was then recovering from the terrible Gothic Wars  and the small Byzantine army left for its defence could do almost nothing  The Exarch sent to Italy by Emperor Justin II  Longinus  could defend only coastal cities that could be supplied by the powerful Byzantine fleet  Pavia fell after a siege of three years  in 572  becoming the first capital city of the new Lombard kingdom of Italy  In the following years  the Lombards penetrated further south  conquering Tuscany and establishing two duchies  Spoleto and Benevento under Zotto  which soon became semi independent and even outlasted the northern kingdom  surviving well into the 12th century  The Byzantines managed to retain control of the area of Ravenna and Rome  linked by a thin corridor running through Perugia   When they entered Italy  some Lombards retained their native form of paganism  while some were Arian Christians  Hence they did not enjoy good relations with the Catholic Church  Gradually  they adopted Roman titles  names  and traditions  and partially converted to orthodoxy  in the 7th century   though not without a long series of religious and ethnic conflicts  By the time Paul the Deacon was writing  the Lombard language  dress and even hairstyles had all disappeared   The whole Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies  whose leaders settled in the main cities  The king ruled over them and administered the land through emissaries called gastaldi  This subdivision  however  together with the independent indocility of the duchies  deprived the kingdom of unity  making it weak even when compared to the Byzantines  especially after they began to recover from the initial invasion  This weakness became even more evident when the Lombards had to face the increasing power of the Franks  In response  the kings tried to centralize power over time  but they definitively lost control over Spoleto and Benevento in the attempt   1 3 1 1  Langobardia major  Duchy of Friuli  Duchy of Ceneda

Langobardia minor  Duchy of Spoleto and List of Dukes of Spoleto  Duchy of Benevento and List of Dukes and Princes of Benevento  1 3 2  Arian monarchy  In 572 Alboin was murdered in Verona in a plot led by his wife  Rosamund  who later fled to Ravenna  His successor  Cleph  was also assassinated  after a ruthless reign of 18 months  His death began an interregnum of years  the  Rule of the Dukes   during which the dukes did not elect any king  a period regarded as a time of violence and disorder  In 584  threatened by a Frankish invasion  the dukes elected as king Cleph s son  Authari  In 589  he married Theodelinda  daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria  the Duke of Bavaria  The Catholic Theodelinda was a friend of Pope Gregory I and pushed for Christianization  In the meantime  Authari embarked on a policy of internal reconciliation and tried to reorganize royal administration  The dukes yielded half their estates for the maintenance of the king and his court in Pavia  On the foreign affairs side  Authari managed to thwart the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks   Authari died in 591 and was succeeded by Agilulf  the duke of Turin  who also married Theodelinda in the same year  Agilulf successfully fought the rebel dukes of northern Italy  conquering Padua in 601  Cremona and Mantua in 603  and forcing the Exarch of Ravenna to pay tribute  Agilulf died in 616  Theodelinda reigned alone until 628 when she was succeeded by Adaloald  Arioald  the head of the Arian opposition who had married Theodelinda s daughter Gundeperga  later deposed Adaloald   Arioald was succeeded by Rothari  regarded by many authorities as the most energetic of all Lombard kings  He extended his dominions  conquering Liguria in 643 and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of inner Veneto  including the Roman city of Opitergium  Oderzo   Rothari also made the famous edict bearing his name  the Edictum Rothari  which established the laws and the customs of his people in Latin  the edict did not apply to the tributaries of the Lombards  who could retain their own laws  Rothari s son Rodoald succeeded him in 652  still very young  and was killed by his opponents   At the death of King Aripert I in 661  the kingdom was split between his children Perctarit  who set his capital in Milan  and Godepert  who reigned from Pavia  Ticinum   Perctarit was overthrown by Grimoald  son of Gisulf  duke of Friuli and Benevento since 647  Perctarit fled to the Avars and then to the Franks  Grimoald managed to regain control over the duchies and deflected the late attempt of the Byzantine emperor Constans II to conquer southern Italy  He also defeated the Franks  At Grimoald s death in 671 Perctarit returned and promoted tolerance between Arians and Catholics  but he could not defeat the Arian party  led by Arachi  duke of Trento  who submitted only to his son  the philo Catholic Cunincpert   The Lombards engaged in fierce battles with Slavic peoples during these years  In 623–26 the Lombards unsuccessfully attacked Carantanians  in 663–64  the Slavs raided the Vipava Valley and the Friuli   1 3 3  Catholic monarchy  Religious strife and the Slavic raids remained a source of struggle in the following years  In 705  the Friuli Lombards were defeated and lost the land to the west of the Soča River  namely the Gorizia Hills and the Venetian Slovenia  A new ethnic border was established that has lasted for over 1200 years up until the present time   The Lombard reign began to recover only with Liutprand the Lombard  king from 712   son of Ansprand and successor of the brutal Aripert II  He managed to regain a certain control over Spoleto and Benevento  and  taking advantage of the disagreements between the Pope and Byzantium concerning the reverence of icons  he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of Rome  He also helped the Frankish marshal Charles Martel to drive back the Arabs  The Slavs were defeated in the Battle of Lavariano when they tried to conquer the Friulian Plain in 720  Liutprand s successor Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish it when he was subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks  Pippin III  who was called by the Pope   After the death of Aistulf  Ratchis attempted to become king of Lombardy  but he was deposed by Desiderius  duke of Tuscany  the last Lombard to rule as king  Desiderius managed to take Ravenna definitively  ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy  He decided to reopen struggles against the Pope  who was supporting the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against him  and entered Rome in 772  the first Lombard king to do so  But when Pope Hadrian I called for help from the powerful Frankish king Charlemagne  Desiderius was defeated at Susa and besieged in Pavia  while his son Adelchis was forced to open the gates of Verona to Frankish troops  Desiderius surrendered in 774  and Charlemagne  in an utterly novel decision  took the title  King of the Lombards   Before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other  but none had adopted the title of King of another people  Charlemagne took part of the Lombard territory to create the Papal States   The Lombardy region in Italy  which includes the cities of Brescia  Bergamo  Milan  and the old capital Pavia  is a reminder of the presence of the Lombards   1 4  Later history  1 4 1  United Principality of Benevento  774舑849  Though the kingdom centred on Pavia in the north fell to Charlemagne  the Lombard controlled territory to the south of the Papal States was never subjugated by Charlemagne or his descendants  In 774  Duke Arechis II of Benevento  whose duchy had only nominally been under royal authority  though certain kings had been effective at making their power known in the south  claimed that Benevento was the successor state of the kingdom  He tried to turn Benevento into a secundum Ticinum  a second Pavia  He tried to claim the kingship  but with no support and no chance of a coronation in Pavia   Charlemagne came down with an army  and his son Louis the Pious sent men  to force the Beneventan duke to submit  but his submission and promises were never kept and Arechis and his successors were de facto independent  The Beneventan dukes took the title princeps  prince  instead of that of king   The Lombards of southern Italy were thereafter in the anomalous position of holding land claimed by two empires  the Carolingian Empire to the north and west and the Byzantine Empire to the east  They typically made pledges and promises of tribute to the Carolingians  but effectively remained outside Frankish control  Benevento meanwhile grew to its greatest extent yet when it imposed a tribute on the Duchy of Naples  which was tenuously loyal to Byzantium and even conquered the Neapolitan city of Amalfi in 838  At one point in the reign of Sicard  Lombard control covered most of southern Italy save the very south of Apulia and Calabria and Naples  with its nominally attached cities  It was during the 9th century that a strong Lombard presence became entrenched in formerly Greek Apulia  However  Sicard had opened up the south to the invasive actions of the Saracens in his war with Andrew II of Naples and when he was assassinated in 839  Amalfi declared independence and two factions fought for power in Benevento  crippling the principality and making it susceptible to external enemies   The civil war lasted ten years and ended with a peace treaty imposed in 849 by Emperor Louis II  the only Frankish king to exercise actual sovereignty over the Lombard states  The treaty divided the kingdom into two states  the Principality of Benevento and the Principality of Salerno  with its capital at Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea   1 4 2  Southern Italy and the Arabs  836舑915  Andrew II of Naples hired Saracen mercenaries for his war with Sicard of Benevento in 836  Sicard responded with other Muslim mercenaries  The Saracens initially concentrated their attacks on Sicily and Byzantine Italy  but soon Radelchis I of Benevento called in more mercenaries  who destroyed Capua in 841  Landulf the Old founded the present day Capua   New Capua   on a nearby hill  In general  the Lombard princes were less inclined to ally with the Saracens than with their Greek neighbours of Amalfi  Gaeta  Naples  and Sorrento  Guaifer of Salerno  however  briefly put himself under Muslim suzerainty   In 847 a large Muslim force seized Bari  until then a Lombard gastaldate under the control of Pandenulf  Saracen incursions proceeded northwards until Adelchis of Benevento sought the help of his suzerain  Louis II  who allied with the Byzantine emperor Basil I to expel the Arabs from Bari in 869  An Arab landing force was defeated by the emperor in 871  Adelchis and Louis remained at war until the death of Louis in 875  Adelchis regarded himself as the true successor of the Lombard kings  and in that capacity he amended the Edictum Rothari  the last Lombard ruler to do so   After the death of Louis  Landulf II of Capua briefly flirted with a Saracen alliance  but Pope John VIII convinced him to break it off  Guaimar I of Salerno fought the Saracens with Byzantine troops  Throughout this period the Lombard princes swung in allegiance from one party to another  Finally  towards 915  Pope John X managed to unite the Christian princes of southern Italy against the Saracen establishments on the Garigliano river  The Saracens were ousted from Italy in the Battle of the Garigliano in 915   1 4 3  The Lombard principalities in the 10th century  The independent state of Salerno inspired the gastalds of Capua to move towards independence  and by the end of the century they were styling themselves  princes  and as a third Lombard state  The Capuan and Beneventan states were united by Atenulf I of Capua in 900  He subsequently declared them to be in perpetual union  and they were separated only in 982  on the death of Pandulf Ironhead  With all of the Lombard south under his control  except Salerno  Atenulf felt safe to use the title princeps gentis Langobardorum   prince of the Lombard people    which Arechis II had begun using in 774  Among Atenulf s successors the principality was ruled jointly by fathers  sons  brothers  cousins  and uncles for the greater part of the century  Meanwhile  the prince Gisulf I of Salerno began using the title Langobardorum gentis princeps around mid century  but the ideal of a united Lombard principality was realised only in December 977  when Gisulf died and his domains were inherited by Pandulf Ironhead  who temporarily held almost all Italy south of Rome and brought the Lombards into alliance with the Holy Roman Empire  His territories were divided upon his death   Landulf the Red of Benevento and Capua tried to conquer the principality of Salerno with the help of John III of Naples  but with the aid of Mastalus I of Amalfi  Gisulf repulsed him  The rulers of Benevento and Capua made several attempts on Byzantine Apulia at this time  but late in the century  the Byzantines  under the stiff rule of Basil II  gained ground on the Lombards   The principal source for the history of the Lombard principalities in this period is the Chronicon Salernitanum  composed late in the 10th century at Salerno   1 4 4  Norman conquest  1017舑1078  The diminished Beneventan principality soon lost its independence to the papacy and declined in importance until it fell in the Norman conquest of southern Italy  The Normans  first called in by the Lombards to fight the Byzantines for control of Apulia and Calabria  under the likes of Melus of Bari and Arduin  among others   had become rivals for hegemony in the south  The Salernitan principality experienced a golden age under Guaimar III and Guaimar IV  but under Gisulf II  the principality shrank to insignificance and fell in 1078 to Robert Guiscard  who had married Gisulf s sister Sichelgaita  The Capua principality was hotly contested during the reign of the hated Pandulf IV  the Wolf of the Abruzzi  and  under his son  it fell  almost without contest  to the Norman Richard Drengot  1058   The Capuans revolted against Norman rule in 1091  expelling Richard s grandson Richard II and setting up one Lando IV   Capua was again put under Norman rule after the Siege of Capua of 1098 and the city quickly declined in importance under a series of ineffectual Norman rulers  The independent status of these Lombard states is in general attested by the ability of their rulers to switch suzerains at will  Often the legal vassal of pope or emperor  either Byzantine or Holy Roman   they were the real power brokers in the south until their erstwhile allies  the Normans  rose to preeminence  The Lombards regarded the Normans as barbarians and the Byzantines as oppressors  Regarding their own civilisation as superior  the Lombards did indeed provide the environment for the illustrious Schola Medica Salernitana   2  Culture  2 1  Language  The Lombardic language is extinct  unless Cimbrian and Mocheno represent surviving dialects   The Germanic language declined beginning in the 7th century  but may have been in scattered use until as late as about the year 1000  The language is preserved only fragmentarily  the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts  In the absence of Lombardic texts  it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the language s morphology and syntax  The genetic classification of the language is based entirely on phonology  Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in  and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for  the High German consonant shift  it is classified as an Elbe Germanic or Upper German dialect   Lombardic fragments are preserved in runic inscriptions  Among the primary source texts are short inscriptions in the Elder Futhark  among them the  bronze capsule of Schretzheim   c  600   There are a number of Latin texts that include Lombardic names  and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular  In 2005  there were claims that the inscription of the Pernik sword may be Lombardic   The Italian language preserves a large number of Lombardic words  although it is not always easy to distinguish them from other Germanic languages such as Gothic and Frankish  They often bear some resemblance to English words  as Lombardic was akin to Saxon  For instance  landa from land  guardia from wardan  warden   guerra from werra  war   and guadare from wadjan  to wade    2 2  Social structure  2 2 1  Migration Period society  The Lombard kings can be traced back as early as c  380 and thus to the beginning of the Great Migration  Kingship developed amongst the Germanic peoples when the unity of a single military command was found necessary  Schmidt believed that the Germanic tribes were divided according to cantons and that the earliest government was a general assembly that selected canton chiefs and war leaders in times of conflict  All such figures were probably selected from a caste of nobility  As a result of the wars of their wanderings  royal power developed such that the king became the representative of the people  but the influence of the people upon the government did not fully disappear  Paul the Deacon gives an account of the Lombard tribal structure during the migration         in order that they might increase the number of their warriors   the Lombards  confer liberty upon many whom they deliver from the yoke of bondage  and that the freedom of these may be regarded as established  they confirm it in their accustomed way by an arrow  uttering certain words of their country in confirmation of the fact  Complete emancipation appears to have been granted only among the Franks and the Lombards   2 2 2  Society of the Catholic kingdom  Lombard society was divided into classes comparable to those found in the other Germanic successor states of Rome  Frankish Gaul and Visigothic Spain  There was a noble class  a class of free persons beneath them  a class of unfree non slaves  serfs   and finally slaves  The aristocracy itself was poorer  more urbanised  and less landed than elsewhere  Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself  Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities  unlike their Frankish counterparts  and hold little more than twice as much in land as the merchant class  a far cry from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land  hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status   The aristocracy by the 8th century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties  many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as iudices  judges  even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well   The freemen of the Lombard kingdom were far more numerous than in Frank lands  especially in the 8th century  when they are almost invisible in surviving documentary evidence  Smallholders  owner cultivators  and rentiers are the most numerous types of person in surviving diplomata for the Lombard kingdom  They may have owned more than half of the land in Lombard Italy  The freemen were exercitales and viri devoti  that is  soldiers and  devoted men   a military term like  retainers    they formed the levy of the Lombard army  and they were sometimes  if infrequently  called to serve  though this seems not to have been their preference  The small landed class  however  lacked the political influence necessary with the king  and the dukes  to control the politics and legislation of the kingdom  The aristocracy was more thoroughly powerful politically if not economically in Italy than in contemporary Gaul and Spain   The urbanisation of Lombard Italy was characterised by the città ad isole  or  city as islands    It appears from archaeology that the great cities of Lombard Italy — Pavia  Lucca  Siena  Arezzo  Milan — were themselves formed of minute islands of urbanisation within the old Roman city walls  The cities of the Roman Empire had been partially destroyed in the series of wars of the 5th and 6th centuries  Many sectors were left in ruins and ancient monuments became fields of grass used as pastures for animals  thus the Roman Forum became the Campo Vaccino  the field of cows  The portions of the cities that remained intact were small  modest  contained a cathedral or major church  often sumptuously decorated   and a few public buildings and townhomes of the aristocracy  Few buildings of importance were stone  most were wood  In the end  the inhabited parts of the cities were separated from one another by stretches of pasture even within the city walls   2 2 3  Lombard states  Lombard

Benevento  Principality of Salerno and List of Princes of Salerno  Principality of Capua and List of Princes of Capua  2 3  Religious history  2 3 1  Paganism  St  Barbatus of Benevento observed many pagan rituals and traditions amongst the Lombards authorised by the Duke Romuald  son of King Grimoald   2 3 2  Christianisation  The Lombards were first touched by Christianity while still in Pannonia  but only touched  Their conversion and Christianisation was largely nominal and far from complete  During the reign of Wacho  they were Roman Catholics allied with the Byzantine Empire  but Alboin converted to Arianism as an ally of the Ostrogoths and invaded Italy  All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy  while the common people remained pagan   In Italy  the Lombards were intensively Christianised  and the pressure to convert to Catholicism was great  With the Bavarian queen Theodelinda  a Catholic  the monarchy was brought under heavy Catholic influence  After initial support for the anti Rome party in the Schism of the Three Chapters  Theodelinda remained a close contact and supporter of Pope Gregory I  In 603  Adaloald  the heir to the throne  received a Catholic baptism  During the next century  Arianism and paganism continued to hold out in Austria  the northeast of Italy  and in the Duchy of Benevento  A succession of Arian kings were militarily aggressive and presented a threat to the Papacy in Rome  In the 7th century  the nominally Christian aristocracy of Benevento was still practising pagan rituals  such as sacrifices in  sacred  woods  By the end of the reign of Cunincpert  however  the Lombards were more or less completely Catholicised  Under Liutprand  the Catholicism became tangible  as the king sought to justify his title rex totius Italiae by uniting the south of the peninsula with the north and bringing together his Italo Roman and Germanic subjects into one Catholic state   2 3 3  Beneventan Christianity  The Duchy and eventually Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian rite in the 7th and 8th centuries  The Beneventan rite is more closely related to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than to the Roman rite  The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form  although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant  The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete  less systematic  and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite   Characteristic of this rite was the Beneventan chant  a Lombard influenced chant that bore similarities to the Ambrosian chant of Lombard Milan  The Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite  many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks  appearing variously as antiphons  offertories  and communions  for example  It was eventually supplanted by the Gregorian chant in the 11th century   The chief centre of the Beneventan chant was Montecassino  one of the first and greatest abbeys of Western monasticism  Gisulf II of Benevento had donated a large swathe of land to Montecassino in 744  and that became the basis for an important state  the Terra Sancti Benedicti  which was a subject only to Rome  The Cassinese influence on Christianity in southern Italy was immense  Montecassino was also the starting point for another characteristic of Beneventan monasticism  the use of the distinct Beneventan script  a clear  angular script derived from the Roman cursive as used by the Lombards   2 4  Art and architecture  During their nomadic phase  the Lombards primarily created art that was easily carried with them  like arms and jewellery  Though relatively little of this has survived  it bears resemblance to the similar endeavours of other Germanic tribes of northern and central Europe from the same era   The first major modifications to the Germanic style of the Lombards came in Pannonia and especially in Italy  under the influence of local  Byzantine  and Christian styles  The conversions from nomadism and paganism to settlement and Christianity also opened up new arenas of artistic expression  such as architecture  especially churches  and its accompanying decorative arts  such as frescoes   File Langobard Shield Boss 7th

 Tempietto Longobardo  Cividale del Friuli  2 4 1  Architecture  Few Lombard buildings have survived  Most have been lost  rebuilt  or renovated at some point  so they preserve little of their original Lombard structure  Lombard architecture was well studied in the 20th century  and the four volume Lombard Architecture  1919  by Arthur Kingsley Porter is a  monument of illustrated history    The small Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle in Cividale del Friuli is probably one of the oldest preserved examples of Lombard architecture  as Cividale was the first Lombard city in Italy  Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in Pavia  San Pietro in Ciel d Oro  crypts of Sant Eusebio and San Giovanni Domnarum  and Monza  cathedral   The Basilic autariana in Fara Gera d Adda near Bergamo and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia also have Lombard elements  All these buildings are in northern Italy  Langobardia major   but by far the best preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy  Langobardia minor   The Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento was erected in 760 by Duke Arechis II  and it preserves Lombard frescoes on the walls and even Lombard capitals on the columns   Lombard architecture flourished under the impulse provided by the Catholic monarchs like Theodelinda  Liutprand  and Desiderius to the foundation of monasteries to further their political control  Bobbio Abbey was founded during this time   Some of the late Lombard structures of the 9th and 10th centuries have been found to contain elements of style associated with Romanesque architecture and have been so dubbed  first Romanesque   These edifices are considered  along with some similar buildings in southern France and Catalonia  to mark a transitory phase between the Pre Romanesque and full fledged Romanesque   3  See also  Longobards in Italy  Places of Power  568 774 A D    Barbarian invasions  List of ancient Germanic peoples  4  References   Notes   Bibliography
