Jarvis Island    formerly known as Bunker Island  is an uninhabited coral island located in the South Pacific Ocean at   about halfway between Hawaii and the Cook Islands  It is an unincorporated  unorganized territory of the United States  administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior as part of the National Wildlife Refuge system  Unlike most coral atolls  the lagoon on Jarvis is wholly dry   Jarvis is one of the Line Islands and for statistical purposes is also grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands   1  Geography and ecology  While a few offshore anchorage spots are marked on maps  Jarvis island has no ports or harbors  and swift currents are a hazard  There is a boat landing area in the middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon  and another near the southwest corner of the island  The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated  which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century  The island has a tropical desert climate  with high daytime temperatures  constant wind  and strong sun  Nights  however  are quite cool  The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet  7 meters  at its highest point  The low lying coral island has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef   Located only south of the equator  Jarvis has no known natural freshwater lens and scant rainfall  This creates a very bleak  flat landscape without any plants larger than shrubs  There is no evidence that the island has ever supported a self sustaining human population  Its sparse bunch grass  prostrate vines and low growing shrubs are primarily a nesting  roosting  and foraging habitat for seabirds  shorebirds  and marine wildlife   2  History  2 1  Discovery  The island s first known sighting by Europeans was on August 21  1821 by the British ship Eliza Francis  or Eliza Frances  owned by Edward  Thomas and William Jarvis and commanded by Captain Brown  In March 1857 the uninhabited island was claimed for the United States under the Guano Islands Act and formally annexed on February 27  1858   2 2  Nineteenth century guano mining  The American Guano Company  which was incorporated in 1857  established claims in respect of Baker Island and Jarvis Island which was recognised under the U S  Guano Islands Act of 1856  Beginning in 1858  several support structures were built on Jarvis Island  along with a two story  eight room  superintendent s house  featuring an observation cupola and wide verandahs  Tram tracks were laid down for bringing mined guano to the western shore  One of the first loads was taken by Samuel Gardner Wilder  For the following twenty one years  Jarvis was commercially mined for guano  sent to the United States as fertilizer  but the island was abruptly abandoned in 1879  leaving behind about a dozen buildings and 8 000 tonnes of mined guano   New Zealand entrepreneurs  including photographer Henry Winkelmann  then made unsuccessful attempts to continue guano extraction on Jarvis  and the two story house was sporadically inhabited during the early 1880s  Squire Flockton was left alone on the island as caretaker for several months and committed suicide there in 1883  apparently from gin fueled despair  His wooden grave marker was a carved plank which could be seen in the island s tiny four grave cemetery for decades   John T  Arundel & Co  resumed mining guano from 1886 to 1899  The United Kingdom annexed the island on June 3  1889  Phosphate and copra entrepreneur John T  Arundel visited the island in 1909 on maiden voyage of the S S  Ocean Queen and near the beach landing on the western shore members of the crew built a pyramidal day beacon made from slats of wood  which was painted white  The beacon was standing in 1935  and remained until at least 1942   2 3  Wreck of barquentine Amaranth  On August 30  1913  the barquentine Amaranth  C  W  Nielson  captain  was carrying a cargo of coal from Newcastle  New South Wales to San Francisco when it wrecked on Jarvis  southern shore  Ruins of ten wooden guano mining buildings  the two story house among them  could still be seen by the Amaranth crew  who left Jarvis aboard two lifeboats  One reached Pago Pago  American Samoa and the other made Apia in Western Samoa  The ship s scattered remains were noted and scavenged for many years  and rounded fragments of coal from the Amaranth s hold were still being found on the south beach in the late 1930s   2 4  Millersville  1935 1942   Jarvis Island was reclaimed by the United States government and colonized from March 26  1935 onwards  under the Baker  Howland and Jarvis Colonization Scheme  see also Howland Island and Baker Island   President Franklin D  Roosevelt assigned administration of the island to the U S  Department of the Interior on May 13  1936  Starting out as a cluster of large  open tents pitched next to the still standing white wooden day beacon  the Millersville settlement on the island s western shore was named after a bureaucrat with the United States Department of Air Commerce  The settlement grew into a group of shacks built mostly with wreckage from the Amaranth  lumber from which was also used by the young Hawaiian colonists to build surfboards   but later  stone and wood dwellings were built and equipped with refrigeration  radio equipment  and a weather station  A crude aircraft landing area was cleared on the northeast side of the island  and a T shaped marker which was intended to be seen from the air was made from gathered stones  but no airplane is known to have ever landed there   At the beginning of World War II  an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine surfaced off the west coast of the Island  Believing that it was a U S  Navy submarine which had come to fetch them  the four young colonists rushed down the steep western beach in front of Millersville towards the shore  The submarine answered their waves with fire from its deck gun  but no one was hurt in the attack  On February 7  1942  the USCGC Taney evacuated the colonists  then shelled and burned the dwellings  The roughly cleared landing area on the island s northeast end was later shelled by the Japanese  leaving crater holes   2 5  International Geophysical Year  Jarvis was visited by scientists during the International Geophysical Year from July 1957 until November 1958  In January 1958 all scattered building ruins from both the nineteenth century guano diggings and the 1935 1942 colonization attempt were swept away without a trace by a severe storm which lasted several days and was witnessed by the scientists  When the IGY research project ended the island was abandoned again  By the early 1960s a few sheds  a century of accumulated trash  the scientists  house from the late 1950s and a solid  short lighthouse like day beacon built two decades before were the only signs of human habitation on Jarvis   3  National Wildlife Refuge  On June 27  1974  Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton created Jarvis Island National Wildlife Refuge which was expanded in 2009 to add submerged lands within of the island  The refuge now includes of land and of water  Along with six other islands  the island was administered by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex  In January 2009  that entity was upgraded to the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument by President George W  Bush   A feral cat population  descendants of cats brought by guano miners  wrought disruption to the island s wildlife and vegetation since the 1930s  These cats were removed through efforts which began in the mid 1960s and lasted until 1990 when they were completely eradicated  Nineteenth century tram track remains can be seen in the dried lagoon bed at the island s center and the late 1930s era lighthouse shaped day beacon still stands on the western shore at the site of Millersville   Public entry to Jarvis Island requires a special use permit and is generally restricted to scientists and educators  The island is visited periodically by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Coast Guard   4  See also  Howland and Baker islands  List of Guano Island claims  Under a
