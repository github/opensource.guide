Tantalum is a chemical element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73  Previously known as tantalium  its name comes from Tantalus  a hero from Greek mythology  Tantalum is a rare  hard  blue gray  lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant  It is part of the refractory metals group  which are widely used as minor components in alloys  The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum  Tantalum is also used for medical implants and bone repair  Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones  DVD players  video game systems and computers  Tantalum  always together with the chemically similar niobium  occurs in the minerals tantalite  columbite and coltan  a mix of columbite and tantalite    1  History  Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg  One year earlier  Charles Hatchett had discovered the element columbium  In 1809  the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite  with a density 5 918 g cm3  and tantalum—tantalite  with a density 7 935 g cm3  and concluded that the two oxides  despite their difference in measured density  were identical  He decided to keep the name tantalum  After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results  it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element  This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose  who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample  and he named them after the children of Tantalus  niobium  from Niobe  the goddess of tears   and pelopium  from Pelops   The supposed element  pelopium  was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium  and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett   The differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand  and Henri Etienne Sainte Claire Deville  as well as by Louis J  Troost  who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865  Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac  in 1866  who proved that there were only two elements  These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so called ilmenium until 1871  De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864  when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen  Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum  and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in 1903  Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use   The name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological Tantalus  the father of Niobe in Greek mythology  In the story  he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head  both of which eternally tantalized him   If he bent to drink the water  it drained below the level he could reach  and if he reached for the fruit  the branches moved out of his grasp   Ekeberg wrote  This metal I call tantalum     partly in allusion to its incapacity  when immersed in acid  to absorb any and be saturated    For decades  the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate  a process that was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866  This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride containing solutions of tantalum   2  Characteristics  2 1  Physical properties  Tantalum is dark  blue gray   dense  ductile  very hard  easily fabricated  and highly conductive of heat and electricity  The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids  in fact  at temperatures below 150 °C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia  It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide  as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide  Tantalum s high melting point of 3017 °C  boiling point 5458 °C  is exceeded only by tungsten  rhenium and osmium for metals  and carbon   Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases  alpha and beta  The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft  it has body centered cubic structure  space group Im3m  lattice constant a   0 33058 nm   Knoop hardness 200–400 HN and electrical resistivity 15–60 µΩּcm  The beta phase is hard and brittle  its crystal symmetry is tetragonal  space group P42 mnm  a   1 0194 nm  c   0 5313 nm   Knoop hardness is 1000–1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170–210 µΩּcm  The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750–775 °C  Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase  and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering  chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from an eutectic molten salt solution   2 2  Chemical properties  Tantalum forms oxides with the oxidation states +5  Ta2O5  and +4  TaO2   The most stable oxidation state is +5  as seen in tantalum pentoxide  Tantalum pentoxide is the starting material for several tantalum compounds  The compounds are created by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in another metal oxide  Such examples are lithium tantalate  LiTaO3  and lanthanum tantalate  LaTaO4   In the lithium tantalate  the tantalate ion does not occur  instead  this part of the formula represents linkage of octahedra to form a three dimensional perovskite framework  while the lanthanum tantalate contains lone tetrahedral groups   The fluorides of tantalum can be used for its separation from niobium  Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5  +4  and +3 of the type     and   although multi core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known  Tantalum pentafluoride  TaF5  is a white solid with a melting point of 97 0 °C and tantalum pentachloride  TaCl5  is a white solid with a melting point of 247 4 °C  Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride  TaCl4   While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen  the dihalides do not exist  A tantalum tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals  Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008  As in the cases of most other refractory metals  the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides  Tantalum carbide  TaC  like the more commonly used tungsten carbide  is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools  Tantalum III  nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes  Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide graphite composite material that is one of the hardest materials ever synthesized  Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum tungsten copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys  There are two tantalum aluminides  TaAl3 and Ta3Al  These are stable  refractory  and reflective  and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors   2 3  Isotopes  Natural tantalum consists of two isotopes  180mTa  0 012%  and 181Ta  99 988%   181Ta is a stable isotope  180mTa  m denotes a metastable state  is predicted to decay in three ways  isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta  beta decay to 180W  or electron capture to 180Hf  However  radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed  and only a lower limit on its half life of 2 0 × 1016 years has been set  The ground state of 180Ta has a half life of only 8 hours  180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer  excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short living nuclides   It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe  taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes  and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short living nuclides    Tantalum has been examined theoretically as a  salting  material for nuclear weapons  cobalt is the better known hypothetical salting material   An external shell of 181Ta would be irradiated by the intensive high energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon  This would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope 182Ta  which has a half life of 114 4 days and produces gamma rays with approximately 1 12 million electron volts  MeV  of energy apiece  which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the nuclear fallout from the explosion for several months  Such  salted  weapons have never been built or tested  as far as is publicly known  and certainly never used as weapons   Tantalum can be used as a target material for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short lived isotopes including 8Li  80Rb  and 160Yb   2 4  Occurrence  Tantalum is estimated to make up about 1 ppm or 2 ppm of the Earth s crust by weight  There are many species of tantalum minerals  only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials  tantalite  microlite  wodginite  euxenite  polycrase  Tantalite  Fe  Mn Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction  Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite  Fe  Mn   Ta  Nb 2O6  when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite  or niobite   The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method  Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite   The primary mining of tantalum is in Australia  where the largest producer  Global Advanced Metals  formerly known as Talison Minerals  operates two mines in Western Australia  Greenbushes in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region  The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late 2008 due to the global financial crisis  Less than a year after it reopened  Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again      softening tantalum demand       and other factors  tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012  Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers  Whereas the large scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada  the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum  Some other countries such as China  Ethiopia  and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum  and they produce a significant percentage of the world s output of it  Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by product of the tin mining there  During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits  not only is Cassiterite  SnO2  found  but a small percentage of tantalite also included  The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum  which is leached from the slag  Future sources of supply of tantalum  in order of estimated size  are being explored in Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Greenland  China  Mozambique  Canada  Australia  the United States  Finland  and Brazil   It is estimated that there are less than 50 years left of tantalum resources  based on extraction at current rates  demonstrating the need for increased recycling   3  Status as a conflict resource  Tantalum is considered a conflict resource  Coltan  the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium  i e  niobium  and tantalum are extracted  can also be found in Central Africa  which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  formerly Zaire   According to an October 23  2003 United Nations report  the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo  a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5 4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II  Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior  human rights  and endangering wildlife  due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin  However  although important for the local economy in Congo  the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small  The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world s tantalum output in 2002–2006  peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008   The stated aim of the Solutions for Hope Tantalum Project is to  source conflict free tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo   4  Production and fabrication  Several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite  First  the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation  This is generally carried out near the mine site   4 1  Chemical refining  Tantalum ores often contain significant amounts of niobium  which is itself a valuable metal  As such  both metals are extracted so that they may be sold  The overall process is one of hydrometallurgy  A large number of chemical treatment procedures for the breakdown of primary sources have been developed  Some of these have been adopted for commercial production while others have been tested on a fairly large scale  There are yet a few others that have been tested only on a laboratory scale  All these processes can essentially be divided into reduction to metallic or compound form  via aluminothermic or carbothermic reduction reactions   chlorination  alkaline fusion and acid dissolution   Extraction begins with a leaching  a step in which the ore is treated with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid to produce water soluble hydrogen fluorides  This allows the metals to be separated from the various non metallic impurities in the rock   The tantalum and niobium hydrogen fluorides are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid liquid extraction using organic solvents  such as cyclohexanone or methyl isobutyl ketone  This step allows the simple removal of various metal impurities  e g  iron  manganese  titanitum  zirconium  which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of fluorides  Separation of the tantalum and niobium is then achieved by pH adjustment  Niobium requires a higher level of acidity to remain soluble in the organic phase and can hence be selectively removed by extraction into less acidic water  The pure tantalum hydrogen fluoride solution is then neutralised with aqueous ammonia to give tantalum hydroxide  Ta OH 5   which is calcinated to tantalum pentoxide  Ta2O5    The hydrogen fluoride can also be treated with potassium fluoride to produce potassium heptafluorotantalate  K2 TaF7    This is used to produce metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium  at approximately 800 °C in molten salt   In an older method  called the Marignac process  the tantalum and noibium were separated by treating the initial aqueous mixture of hydrogen fluorides with potassium fluoride   The resulting niobium and tantalum potassium fluorides  K2 TaF7   K2 NbOF5   could then be separated by fractional crystallization  due to their different water solubiliies   4 2  Electrolysis  Electrolysis using a modified version of the Hall–Héroult process  Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form  tantalum electrolysis operates on non liquid powdered oxides  The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current  The cathode uses powdered metal oxide  The anode is made of carbon  The molten salt at is the electrolyte  The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3 4% of annual global demand   4 3  Fabrication and metalworking  All welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases  Tantalum is not solderable  Grinding tantalum is difficult  especially so for annealed tantalum  In the annealed condition  tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets   5  Applications  5 1  Electronics  The major use for tantalum  as the metal powder  is in the production of electronic components  mainly capacitors and some high power resistors  Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer  using tantalum powder  pressed into a pellet shape  as one  plate  of the capacitor  the oxide as the dielectric  and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other  plate   Because the dielectric layer can be very thin  thinner than the similar layer in  for instance  an aluminium electrolytic capacitor   a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume  Because of the size and weight advantages  tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones  personal computers  and automotive electronics   5 2  Alloys  Tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points  are strong and have good ductility  Alloyed with other metals  it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components  chemical process equipment  nuclear reactors  and missile parts  Because of its ductility  tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments  which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium  Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating  tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants  For example  porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum s ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue   Tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid  also hot alkaline solutions cause tantalum to corrode  This property makes it an ideal metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids  Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum  Tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters  The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes   5 3  Other uses  The high melting point and oxidation resistance lead to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts  Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts  such as thermowells  valve bodies  and tantalum fasteners  Due to its high density  shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum  Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point  It is also occasionally used in precious watches e g  from Audemars Piguet  Hublot  Montblanc  Omega  and Panerai  Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material  The elasticity of tantalum makes it a great material for hip replacements to avoid stress shielding  Because tantalum is a non ferrous metal  non magnetic   these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures  The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses   6  Precautions  Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory  The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings  therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound  A single study is the only reference in literature linking tantalum to local sarcomas  The study was quoted in IARC Monograph vol  74 which includes the following  Note to the reader    Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs does not imply that it is a carcinogen  only that the published data have been examined    7  References  8  External links  at The
