Rachel Anne Summers  also known as Rachel Grey  is a fictional character  a comic book superheroine created by writer Chris Claremont and artist co writer John Byrne for Marvel Comics   In her first appearance  the character s surname was not revealed  later publications and retcons further expanded her backstory to involve central characters of mainstream continuity  She is the daughter of the alternate future counterparts to Cyclops  Scott Summers  and Jean Grey Summers from a harsh dystopia  the  half  sister of Cable  a niece of Havok and Vulcan  and a powerful mutant in her own right   Rachel Summers inherited her mother s vast telepathic and telekinetic talents  She also inherited her mother s original code names Phoenix and Marvel Girl  Although the character is considered unique to the Marvel Comics  multiverse   her name has been used to designate the mother of Marvel characters Hyperstorm and Dream Richards in respective timelines   1  Publication history  Rachel first appeared in The Uncanny X Men #141  January 1981  and has since been affiliated with several comic book superhero teams including the X Men and Excalibur   2  Fictional character biography  2 1  Future adolescence  Rachel Anne Summers comes from an alternate future Earth known as Earth 811  as seen in the  Days of Future Past  storyline from The Uncanny X Men #141–142  In this reality  the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly provoked the ratification of the Mutant Registration Act  leading to a dystopian future where the mutant hunting Sentinel robots rule North America  Rachel was abducted by operatives working for Ahab  who used drugs and hypnotherapy to turn Rachel into a  Hound   a mutant who tracks down other mutants  She fulfilled her duties  but her psychic powers linked her to her victims  fueling her grief and despair until she attacked Ahab and scarred him  In return  he sent her to the mutant concentration camps  There  she befriended the surviving mutant rebels  including Wolverine  Magneto  Colossus  Storm  Kate Pryde  and her lover  the adult Franklin Richards   Rachel managed to send Kate s consciousness into the past to her younger self to prevent the assassination  but it did not change their time  Rachel sent her astral form into the past to find out why and discovered she had sent Kate into an alternate past  On the way back  she encountered the disembodied Phoenix Force and it followed her to her present  Rachel passed out from the strain of astral projection and the Phoenix Force revealed itself to Kate  who asked it to give Rachel a fresh start   When Rachel and Kate broke into  Project  Nimrod  on a suicide mission to destroy a new model of Sentinel  they became trapped  When Kate spoke the words  Dark Phoenix   the Phoenix Force ripped Rachel from her timeline and sent her body back to the alternate past to which she had sent Kate s consciousness  This was a past where she learned Jean Grey was dead and that her father was married to someone else  Rachel experienced additional heartache and displacement trauma when she discovered that her father s new wife  Madelyne Pryor  was pregnant with a son  Nathan Summers   because in her timeline she was the first born child of Scott Summers   2 2  X Men  Rachel had a brief membership in the X Men before finding a Shi ar holoempathic crystal at her grandparents  home  The crystal was imprinted with a portion of Rachel s mother s essence inside it as a tribute to the family shortly after Jean Grey s death  After Rachel took a vow to remember her mother with the uniform and name of Phoenix  the Phoenix Force fully bonded with her  She was granted access to its power on a cosmic magnitude  albeit in a much more limited fashion than the Dark Phoenix  Soon after  the grudge which she had begun with Selene boiled over when Rachel secretly invaded the Hellfire Club  She did this with the intention of taking vengeance on Selene for the murders she had committed  particularly that of nightclub owner Nicholas Damiano  who had previously taken Rachel into his home after Selene had attacked her  Selene proved to be no match for Rachel s newly increased powers  but just as she was about to finish Selene  Wolverine arrived and was forced to stab Rachel in the chest  Mortally injured  Rachel was lured into Spiral s  Body Shoppe    2 3  Excalibur  Months later  while recuperating from injuries on Muir Island  Shadowcat and Nightcrawler both had the same dream  where they were actors on a weird set and helped Rachel  who was trapped there  escape  Shortly thereafter  Rachel escaped from the alternate reality of Mojoworld  Rachel has once been cited having a flashback to her time there where she is held in chains and tortured  The three former X Men were joined by Captain Britain and Meggan and founded the British superhero team Excalibur  While part of the team  she discovered that this universe s version of her mother  Jean Grey  was alive  She attempted to bond with Jean  but Jean  upon discovering Rachel was the present host for the Phoenix  rejected any contact with her  Jean still resented the Phoenix Force for stealing a portion of her life  She also rejected Rachel because she felt that Rachel s existence was a constant reminder of the dystopian future she feared could still come to pass  Eventually  however  Jean moved past those feelings and formally welcomed Rachel into her life   2 4  Askani  Rachel remained with Excalibur until an incident caused Captain Britain to be lost in the timestream  She exchanged places with the time lost Captain Britain and emerged two thousand years in the future  in a world conquered by Apocalypse and crushed under his iron fist  She gathered together a group of rebels and founded the Askani  She trained one of her followers to travel back in time and bring her  brother  Nathan forward in time when he was infected with a techno organic virus  The Askani cloned Nathan in case he was not able to survive the virus  Apocalypse s followers attacked the Askani and took the clone  who would later become the supervillain Stryfe   leaving Rachel critically injured  Hooked up to life support  she drew the minds of Scott and Jean into the future  as  Slym  and  Redd   to raise Nathan and tutor him in the use of his powers  Rachel finally died ten years later and sent Scott and Jean back to their original bodies seconds after they had left   After Nathan  now known as Cable  had finally defeated Apocalypse  he went into the timeline to retrieve Rachel  There  he discovered a Rachel sans Phoenix Force  With the premature death of Apocalypse  the Askani timeline had been diverged from the mainstream Marvel Universe  Earth 616  As a result  she had been flung into the far future  yet subjectively a short time after she had been lost in the timestream  as the slave of a creature called  Gaunt   who had used her to lead Cable there for a  battle of the ages   Cable defeated Gaunt in the battle and Rachel  now free  was able to use her residual Phoenix Force to return them both to the present  She then decided to take a break from superheroics and enrolled in college after she made Cable promise he would not tell anyone she was back  Despite her efforts to live a normal life  however  she was kidnapped by the telepath Elias Bogan and subsequently rescued by the X Men   2 5  Rachel Grey  She decided to rejoin the X Men  taking the name  Marvel Girl  to honor her mother  who had recently died yet again  and wearing a costume her mother had designed but never worn  a variation on Jean s first green costume  She also changed her last name to  Grey   possibly to express disapproval at her father s betrayal of Jean  as well as his continuing relationship with Emma Frost  though she and Emma made a truce of sorts during one of the team s missions in Hong Kong  Rachel and Nightcrawler began to have an attraction towards each other  kissing at one point  but nothing came of it as Nightcrawler also had an attraction to Storm at the time  who was in somewhat of a romantic  friendship  with Wolverine  Her stint with this team also included a visit to the Savage Land  In the storyline  World s End   which was heavily criticized by readers  Rachel was subjected to the mind control of a tribe of advanced dinosaur people  the Hauk ka  causing her to believe she belonged to their species  Afterward  she subconsciously used her telekinesis to change her own genome in their image  This was eventually reverted  After House of M and Decimation  where most of the world s mutants lost their powers  the government had Sentinels instituted at the X Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack  Though their intentions were good this time  it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps   Rachel had a short stint with newly re formed Excalibur  reminiscent of the former team  shortly after the House of M events  She assisted the team in battling Shadow X and the Shadow King  in the guise of Professor X    2 6  End of Greys  Rachel spent some time with her grandparents  bonding with her grandfather  At a family reunion with all her relatives  a commando unit under the order of the Shi ar attacked the party  killing everyone in an effort to wipe out the Grey genome  The commando unit was unable to kill Rachel  instead  one member was able to graft a  deathmark  on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went  It is assumed that the only remaining member of the Grey family now left on Earth besides Rachel is Cable  Afterward  at the graves of the Grey family  Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi ar and was quoted as saying   I m not my mom  I m not the Phoenix  I m my own woman  And by the time I m done    they ll wish I was the Phoenix    The Death Commandos later tracked Rachel to the psychiatry office of Dr  Maureen Lyszinski  Rachel  with the help of Psylocke  Nightcrawler  Bishop  and Cannonball  saved the doctor and took down the Death Commandos  She decided to imprison them  instead of killing them  by telling them   I mean to find destiny in a way that brings us both  Jean Grey  honor   She is also sometimes referenced as  Starchilde  in this series   2 7  Rise and Fall of the Shi ar Empire  After Rachel was kidnapped  along with Cyclops  by her paternal uncle Vulcan  he freed Darwin from inside him  Later  Professor X recruited Rachel  along with Havok  Nightcrawler  Warpath  Darwin  and Polaris  for a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the Shi ar empire  Xavier  who recently was stripped of his powers  recruited Rachel to serve as his telepathic  eyes and ears  during their mission  Aware of Rachel s vendetta against the Shi ar  Xavier agreed to use their trip into space to find out who in the Shi ar Empire gave the order to wipe out all members of the Grey family  and he warned Rachel that they will deal with the people responsible for her recent losses Xavier s way   While in space  the team was attacked by Korvus  a Shi ar warrior sent to kill Rachel  Korvus  ancestor  Rook shir  was a previous host of the Phoenix Force  and a small portion of the Phoenix s power was left behind in his sword  the Blade of the Phoenix  With this power  Korvus made short work of the other X Men  but when Rachel blocked the sword  their minds were involuntarily linked  Through this link  Rachel learned that Korvus  family was also murdered by the Shi ar government because of their connection to the Phoenix  The remaining echo of the Phoenix power from the sword was then transferred to Rachel  Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power  the power chose to go to her  saying   The Phoenix knows me  remember  It likes me   When this happened  Rachel s normally gold energy aura turned blue  the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix  She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shi ar chancellor was using to force Korvus  obedience   Due to Rachel s connection to Korvus through the sword  she discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo  a  blue shadow   of the Force  The shadow of the Phoenix begins influencing Rachel s behavior  causing her to design a new darker uniform and begin a romance with Korvus  She soon breaks off the relationship after she realizes their bond is only because of the residual Phoenix Force   Leading up to the fight with Vulcan  Rachel is shown using her powers to kill the guards who stand in her way  Havok warns her not to  but Rachel tells him that they deserve to die after what they did to her family  When it comes to the big fight  Rachel shows just how powerful she is by protecting Korvus from one of Vulcan s blasts  Rachel is one of the X Men stranded in Shi ar space when their ship is sent back to Earth   After the death of her other grandfather  Corsair  at the hands of Vulcan  she  along with Havok  Polaris  Korvus  Ch od  and Raza  become the new Starjammers  They elect to remain in Shi ar space and restore Lilandra to the throne or die trying  As her uncle states   If they fail  he has no doubt that Vulcan will head for Earth    2 8  Starjammers  During the conflict  the Starjammers find another threat in the form of the Scy ar Tal  translates as  Death to the Shi ar    Rachel makes contact with the eldest Scy ar Tal and discovers their true origin  The Scy ar Tal were originally called the M Kraan  Early in their history  the Shi`ar attacked them  killing a great number of their people and making the rest flee for their lives  Eventually  the Shi ar settled on their planet  took the M Kraan Crystal as their own  and passed down the legend of the M Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities  Sharra and K ythri  The M Kraan then changed their name to Scy ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi`ar Empire  With their first attack  they destroyed Feather s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it  After which  Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire   During the ceasefire  Rachel comes into contact with the Death Commandos again and attempts to kill them to avenge the deaths of her relatives  however  she is deterred by Polaris  At the end  all the Starjammers are captured by the Shi ar except Rachel  Korvus  and Lilandra   2 9  X Men  Kingbreaker and War of Kings  Rachel and the Starjammers play a large role in the sequel to the Emperor Vulcan miniseries called X Men  Kingbreaker  She is also seen prominently in the  War of Kings  storyline  which features Vulcan  the Inhumans  Nova  and the Guardians of the Galaxy   While with the Starjammers  in battle with Vulcan s new guard  the fragment of the  blue  Phoenix within her and Korvus  blade mysteriously leaves them  After the Phoenix echo leaves Rachel  she says  please    not now     Mom   From this frame onward  the  hound  markings reappear on Rachel s face   In agreement with the Inhumans  the Starjammers and the Guardians of the Galaxy assault a Shi ar vessel in order to free Lilandra  hoping to end the conflict while restoring her to the throne  Even without her Phoenix powers  Rachel is powerful enough to entrap Gladiator in an illusion in order to keep him distracted from battle  Their gambit pays off and the group is able to free Lilandra   Rachel is next seen as Lilandra s bodyguard along with the rest of the Starjammers  On the home planet of the Shi ar  Lilandra assumes her throne  but while making a ceremonial gesture is killed by the murderer known as Razor  who possesses the Darkhawk armor  The only person who perceives this is Rachel  since Razor is shielded from the perceptions of others   After Lilandra is assassinated  Rachel fights alongside the Starjammers against the Shi ar Guard and Araki  who has summoned the same Shi ar commandos that killed Rachel s family and branded her with the Shi ar death mark  Rachel uses her powers to implode Black Cloak s head  saying   He was the one    He killed my family   though killing him does not make her feel happier  Gladiator finishes the job by killing Araki himself  Rachel  along with the rest of the Starjammers  regroup later on and mourn the Shi ar  as they doubt that they will recover from this war   2 10  Realm of Kings  It is known through Ch od  and apparently due to the incident where she and Korvus both lost the connection to the Phoenix Force  that Rachel and Korvus  along with Havok and Polaris  have departed for Earth   2 11  Age of X  While on the way back to Earth  Rachel attempted to contact Professor Xavier or Emma Frost with a message  However at that moment  Moira  a powerful alternate personality of the mutant Legion  warped reality taking Rachel s mind with it creating the amnesic Revenant  Once reality was restored  Rachel s mind is separated from her body which according to her is  half a universe away   Because of Moira s actions  Rachel no longer remembers the message and her mind retains the form of her Age of X counterpart  Scott promised her that they would return her home   2 12  Schism  Being actually a mental manifestation  Rachel soon began fading  She asks Rogue to connect with her to see what will happen  When the two of them touch  Rogue sees a vision of where Rachel  Havok and Polaris are as Rachel then returns to her body  When she awakens she is met by an unseen villain holding a gun and telling her he has killed her friends   Borrowing one of Legion s manifold powers  Rogue teleports alongside Gambit  Magneto and Frenzy to rescue their teammates on the other side of the galaxy  Once there  Rachel is retrieved from a band of pirates as Rogue becomes their new leader  The remaining X Men discover they ve arrived at a space station called Gul Damar which is in a state of upheaval due to the rebellion of insectoid creatures called Grad Nan Holt against their Shi ar enslavers  They are also being pulled into an exploding sun and the entire civil war is revealed to be orchestrated by a powerful Grad Nan Holt telepath known as  Friendless   A number of battles with the creature proves unsuccessful for Rachel  but with the combined efforts of Rogue and the X Men they are able to defeat him and return home via the wormhole that was created from the collapsing star   2 13  X Men  Regenesis  Rachel is then invited to hold a position as senior staff member of the  Jean Grey School for Higher Learning   which was rebuilt from the Xavier Institute and has Wolverine as acting Headmaster and Kitty Pryde as Headmistress   2 14  Avengers Vs  X Men  During the events of AVX  when the X Men on Utopia escape from the invading Avengers  Rachel contacts Cyclops to provide Hope s location  Afterwards  Rachel states that she knows the Phoenix Force better than anyone else on Earth and that she is living proof that it can be controlled  She also says that if the Phoenix has chosen her and that is the destiny that Hope wants  she will do everything in her power to help her  She and Iceman tell Wolverine at the school that they are going to help Cyclops in the battle   2 15  X Men  vol  4   In 2013  Marvel revealed an all new all female series simply named X Men  Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel  X Men will feature an all female cast including Storm  Jubilee  Rogue  Kitty Pryde  Rachel Grey and Psylocke   3  Powers and abilities  Rachel possesses various psionic abilities  generally exhibited through telepathy  psychometry  telekinesis  and limited time manipulation   3 1  Telepathy  Marvel Girl s  virtually unlimited  telepathy allows her to receive  broadcast  and manipulate cognitive processes  such as thoughts  in an intricate manner  Examples of Rachel’s aptitudes for this include creating durable mind links across distances  projecting blasts of psionic energy that disrupt aspects of brain functioning  shielding her mind from other telepaths  creating illusions  and rendering someone invisible to the five senses  In addition  Rachel has demonstrated the ability to telepathically suppress superpowers  control  repair  and exchange minds  even cross temporally  see Chronoskimming   as well as safely editing memories  Rachel has also harnessed her telepathy to sense  locate  and track other mutants based on their thought patterns  but has a moral apprehension about using this skill due to her experiences as a Hound   It has been suggested that Rachel s telepathy  although immeasurable in raw power  is mitigated by her limited training and finesse  This was addressed in Uncanny X Men #452  where the admittedly less powerful  yet more experienced  Emma Frost was able to outflank an incredulous Rachel in a contest on the astral plane  In the same issue  Emma offered her educative services  and later still  Rachel received training from Professor Charles Xavier  while he was depowered   giving her access to his vast knowledge and expertise in telepathy   3 2  Telekinesis  By using telekinesis  Marvel Girl can remotely manipulate matter even on a sub atomic level  She can channel this ability to create protective force fields and blasts of concussive force  By using her telekinesis to levitate herself  Marvel Girl can fly at incredible speeds  Rachel has been able to create a micro black hole  sans Phoenix Force   levitate an entire city for a time  sustain shields that withstood Jovian atmospheric pressures  and direct blows from Thor s hammer  Mjolnir  Moreover  Rachel s telekinetic fine motor control has allowed her to alter molecular valences  mentally alter clothing with ease  create a telekinetic psionic sword  much like Psylocke s telekinetic katana   a telekinetic hammer powerful enough to knock Thor off his feet  and even rewrite human genomes   While all depictions portray Rachel as an extremely powerful telekinetic  the limitations of her hard psi capabilities have been somewhat inconsistent  Some instances have depicted Rachel s telekinetic potential to be nigh unlimited  whereas others have shown her struggling against  and even outmatched by  lesser developed telekinetics such as Psylocke   3 3  Chronoskimming  Marvel Girl utilizes her psionic talents in conjunction with her ability to manipulate time in a variety of ways   Chronoskimming  describes her ability to temporarily transplant a person s mind and send it through time into a younger older version  a close ancestor descendant  or as a disembodied astral form  Rachel unconsciously emanates a fourth dimensional pulse  effectively creating a chrono shield that protects her from changes in the timeline  She can also sense and manipulate residual psychic energy in the form of psychometry   3 4  Phoenix Force  When Rachel was bonded to the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force  she demonstrated heightened psi powers  the ability to manipulate energy and life forces  and limited cosmic awareness  Rachel s connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future and did not return with her when she traveled back to the early 21st century  present  of Earth 616  Marvel s mainstream universe    Most recently  Marvel Girl absorbed a residual echo of the Phoenix Force left in the sword of a previous host  a Shi ar named Rook shir  It was revealed that this energy source was a less powerful  but easier to wield  form of the Phoenix Force  The echo was powerful enough to allow Rachel to survive in and fly through the vacuum of space without the need for additional protection  as well as being able to hold her own in combat against the tremendous physical power of Gladiator  These demonstrations were short lived  however  due to its disappearance  which Rachel attributes to Jean Grey  She now exhibits her standard power levels   3 5  Power signature  As a host for the Phoenix Force  Rachel manifested the cosmic firebird in displays of great power  During her 2000s Uncanny X Men appearances  Marvel Girl also exhibited a Phoenix emblem over her left eye whenever she demonstrated psionic feats  It was at first accompanied by a  shadow form   similar to the one Jean Grey manifested when she absorbed the telepathic powers of Psylocke   However  the illustration of this shadow form ceased without explanation  After regaining a small portion of the Phoenix Force  echo   the emblem over her eye changed from a gold Phoenix shape to a static version made of electric blue flame  Her display of power was once more altered in X Men  Emperor Vulcan #3  where she produced the familiar fiery raptor with which the Phoenix Force is commonly associated  see profile image    3 6  Skills and abilities  At times  Rachel has been shown to learn new skills extremely quickly  For example  she mastered a set of  demon ninja  sword skills simply by watching her teammate Shadowcat perform them  Along with sword fighting  Rachel has experience in lock picking  vehicular repair  such as engines   and use of advanced technology and weaponry  However  these abilities have not been evident in her more recent appearances   3 7  Potential and limitations  Rachel s power level and scope of abilities have been inconsistently described by writers over the years  However  she is usually depicted with  virtually unlimited  potential in her dual psionic talents  In most cases  she displayed greater feats as the Phoenix and even matched Gladiator s strength with the aid of a  Phoenix echo   Rachel is considered by many to be an Omega level mutant  like her mother   but the only literary reference to this attribute is when the future Sentinel  Nimrod  classified Rachel as an  Omega class subject  several years before the term was established in Marvel canon   Even with the omnipotent strength of the Phoenix  magic and magical objects are able to resist Rachel s powers  When the Soulsword appeared near the Excalibur lighthouse headquarters seeking Kitty Pryde to become its new wielder  Rachel attempted to remove it from bedrock to alleviate her friend s apprehension  Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force  Rachel was unable to remove the sword  surmising that only Kitty could remove it   4  Other versions  In the very first issue of the Uncanny X Men story arc  Season of the Witch   Rachel and Psylocke were transported to the White Hot Room as an indirect result of the reality shift performed by a mentally unstable Scarlet Witch  While there  it was established that the Rachel appearing in Earth 616  originally from Earth 811  has no true alternate counterparts within the Marvel multiverse  Rather  all other incarnations of  Rachel Summers  that exist in parallel timelines  see below  are linked only by having the same name  or attributes   4 1  House of M  The subsequent issues had Rachel and Psylocke return to their dimension and thus be engrossed in the Scarlet Witch’s reconstruction of the world  In this reality  Rachel was the bodyguard and traveling companion to Psylocke  who was crowned British royalty after her brother  Brian  became ruler of all England  Rachel then became involved with Captain Britain s mission to seal the breach in reality  rift  that was created by the Scarlet Witch s manipulations   4 2  Variations of Days of Future Past  In at least three alternate future timelines derived from  Days of Future Past   a Rachel Summers married Franklin Richards and procreated mutant children  One such child was the time traveling supervillain Hyperstorm  Jonathan Richards   Hyperstorm was responsible for causing the Fantastic Four to think that Mister Fantastic  Jonathan s grandfather  and Doctor Doom were dead  he was only defeated when he was trapped in another dimension by Galactus  The second child was Dream Summers  who possessed empathic superpowers  She was a superhero who appeared in the Spider Man X Men  Time s Arrow trilogy of novels  although Marvel Comics novels tend to be considered non canon   In a third reality  they produced a child named David Richards  who was rescued from a concentration camp by the interdimensional traveling Exiles and raised by the  Age of Apocalypse  version of Sabretooth  David s traumatic experiences at the camp motivated him to become a fanatical murderer   In another variation of the  Days of Future Past   shown in Weapon X  Days of Future Now  a Rachel Summers was captured by Weapon X and detained in the  Neverland  concentration camp   4 3  Exiles  In the so called  Legacy Earth  reality  in which the Legacy Virus mutated into a techno organic plague  a Rachel Summers was a member of the Avengers  the last superhero group  At Morph s behest  she contacted Thor and the Asgardians to help them against the Vi Locks  a race of beings infected with the techno organic virus   4 4  X Men  The End  The miniseries X Men  The End  written by Chris Claremont  details the last adventures of the X Men in a possible future  In this reality  Rachel played a central role  and was the political campaign manager of Kitty Pryde  Chicago mayoral candidate   However  she abandoned this position after Cassandra Nova led a series of attacks on the X Men and their allies  She traveled alongside Cable into Shi ar space  After a Professor X was taken hostage by Nova  and she entered his psyche in order to free him  However  Nova traps her and Lilandra within  She seemingly kills them both  but Rachel used the power of the Phoenix to save herself  and incapacitates Nova  They leave Xavier s mind  and continue the battle in Rachel s mind  where Rachel is overpowered  Cassandra  using Rachel s body  kills Jean Grey and Cyclops  leaving Rachel forced to watch the ordeal  Nova then leaves Rachel s body  stealing the Phoenix force  The Phoenix being the only thing keeping her alive after her Cassandra destroyed her mental form  she simply died   5  In other media  Rachel Summers  as Phoenix in her Hound costume  made an appearance as a playable character in the 1990 role playing PC game X Men II  The Fall of the Mutants  During gameplay  the player had a choice of utilizing her  psi flash  attack  where her Phoenix raptor would stun her opponents  or if her power was running low  a player could use Rachel s fiery wings to cause physical damage  She was also one of the game s few flying characters alongside Marvel Girl  Jean Grey   Archangel  and Rogue   Rachel Summers   as Rachel Grey  appears as a playable character in the iPad game X Men  Battle of the Atom   Rachel Summers  in her Hound outfit  can be seen in the mid 1990s X Men animated television
