Lyon & Healy is an American harp manufacturer based in Chicago  Illinois  Their Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility contains a showroom and concert hall  George W  Lyon and Patrick J  Healy began the company in 1864 as a sheet music shop  By the end of the 19th century  they manufactured a wide range of musical instruments—including guitars  mandolins  banjos  and various brass and percussion instruments   Lyon & Healy harps are widely played by professional musicians  since they are one of the few makers of harps for orchestral use—which are known as concert harps or pedal harps  Lyon & Healy also makes smaller folk harps or lever harps  based on traditional Irish and Scottish instruments  that use levers to change string pitch instead of pedals  In the 1980s  Lyon & Healy also began to manufacture electroacoustic harps and  later  solid body electric harps   1  History  George W  Lyon and Patrick J  Healy founded the company in 1864  after they moved from Boston to start a sheet music shop for music publisher Oliver Ditson  Determining Lyon & Healy s history is complicated because its building and company records were destroyed in two fires  including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871  Two smaller fires did little damage to the firm and did not result in data loss   Company letters and trade catalogs don t provide exact dates that would reveal when Lyon & Healy began manufacturing instruments  An article in the Musical Courier states that Lyon & Healy began manufacturing instruments in 1885  Clearly  Lyon & Healy was making fretted string instruments in the 1880s  with Washburn  guitars  mandolins  banjos  and zithers  as their premier line  By the 1900s  if not earlier  Lyon & Healy might well have been manufacturing bowed string instruments   Lyon & Healy also made various percussion instruments  Later  Lyon & Healy began manufacturing brass instruments  possibly as early as the 1890s  Lyon & Healy also repaired instruments  and offered engraving services  Complicating matters still further  Lyon & Healy engraved instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture  In its 1892 catalog  it claimed that it manufactured 100 000 instruments annually   File SweetByAndBy1868 png   The Sweet By and By  sheet music  1868   File NorthernSeymourBlairSong png  Cover of Northern  Chicago  campaign song book  1868  File Washburn

organs and pianos  Lyon & Healy evidently began manufacturing these instruments around 1876 in its factories in Chicago and nearby cities  George W  Lyon patented his cottage upright in 1878 and it was sold under the Lyon & Healy name   Lyon retired in 1889  and Healy died in 1905   Lyon & Healy built their first harp in 1889  Healy wanted to develop a harp better suited to the rigors of the American climate than available European models  They successfully produced a harp notable for its strength  pitch reliability  and freedom from unwanted vibration  Previously  most harps in North America where made by small groups of craftsmen in France  England  Ireland  or Italy   In 1890  Lyon & Healy introduced the Style 23 Harp  still a popular and recognizable design  It has 47 strings  highly decorative floral carving on the top of the column  base  and feet  and a fleur de lis pattern at the bottom of the column  It is available in a gold version  It is tall  and weighs about   Lyon & Healy produces one of the most ornate and elaborate harps in the world  the Louis XV  which includes carvings of leaves  flowers  scrolls  and shells along its neck and kneeblock  as well the soundboard edges   In the 1890s the company—which used the slogan  Everything in music —began building pipe organs  In 1894 Robert J  Bennett came to Lyon & Healy from the Hutchens company of Boston to head their organ department  The largest surviving Lyon & Healy pipe organ is at the Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago  It is a large organ of four manuals and 57 ranks of pipes   They also made small pipe organs  An example survives at St  Mary s Catholic Church in Aspen Colorado  It is a two manual tracker with a 30 note straight pedalboard and 7 ranks  It is believed to have been built around 1900  and can still be pumped by hand   By the 1900s  Lyon & Healy was one of the largest music publishers in the world  and was a major producer of musical instruments  However  In late 1920s  Lyon & Healy sold its brass musical instrument manufacturing branch  see  New Langwill Index    In the 1970s  the firm concentrated solely upon making and selling harps   In 1928  Lyon & Healy introduced one of the most unusual harps ever mass produced  the Salzedo Model  The company designed it in collaboration with the harpist Carlos Salzedo  It an Art Deco style instrument that incorporates bold red and white lines on the soundboard to create a stylized and distinct appearance   In the 1960s  Lyon & Healy introduced a smaller lever harp  the Troubadour  a 36 string harp for young beginners with smaller hands  and for casual players  This harp stands   and weighs    In the late 1970s  Steinway & Sons  then owned by CBS  purchased Lyon & Healy and soon after closed all retail stores—that sold sheet music and musical instruments  and their education departments—to focus on harp production   By 1985  Lyon & Healy also made folk harps  also known as Irish harps  which are even smaller than the Troubadour  The  Shamrock model folk harp  has 34 strings  It stands tall with its legs  The legs can be removed so the player can hold the instrument lap—style on the knees  It weighs about   It features Celtic designs on the soundboard  An Irish or folk harp player is sometimes called a harper rather than harpist   DePaul University now owns the Wabash building  Lyon & Healy harps are still in Chicago  Illinois  at 168 North Ogden Avenue  The building was once home to the recording studios of Orlando R  Marsh   The firm still exists in one of its buildings producing a range of harps  including a relatively new addition an electronic harp   2  Craftsmanship  Wood in harp construction varies by instrument  but Sitka Spruce  Picea sitchensis  is the most common soundboard wood  Various Lyon & Healy guitars  mandolins  and many other instrument types reside in major musical instrument museums in the U S  and Europe   Lyon and Healy now primarily manufactures four types of harps—the level harp  petite pedal harp  semi grande pedal harp  and concert grand harp  They also make limited numbers of special harps called concert grands  Lyon & Healy makes electric lever harps in nontraditional colors such as pink  green  blue  and red   3  See also  Washburn Guitars  List of Stradivarius instruments  4  External links  5  Notes
