The walrus  Odobenus rosmarus  is a large flippered marine mammal with a discontinuous distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere  The walrus is the only living species in the Odobenidae family and Odobenus genus  This species is subdivided into three subspecies  the Atlantic walrus  O  r  rosmarus  which lives in the Atlantic Ocean  the Pacific walrus  O  r  divergens  which lives in the Pacific Ocean  and O  r  laptevi  which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean   Adult walruses are easily recognized by their prominent tusks  whiskers  and bulkiness  Adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than and  among pinnipeds  are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals  Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves  spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat  Walruses are relatively long lived  social animals  and they are considered to be a  keystone species  in the Arctic marine regions   The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples  who have hunted the walrus for its meat  fat  skin  tusks  and bone  During the 19th century and the early 20th century  walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber  walrus ivory  and meat  The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region  Their population has rebounded somewhat since then  though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference   1  Etymology  The origin of the word walrus is thought by J R R  Tolkien to derive from a Germanic language  and it has been attributed largely to either the Dutch language or Old Norse  Its first part is thought to derive from a word such as Dutch walvis  whale   Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for  horse   For example  the Old Norse word hrossvalr means  horse whale  and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross  An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal  shore  and reus  giant    The species name rosmarus is Scandinavian  The Norwegian manuscript Konungsskuggsja  thought to date from around AD 1240  refers to the walrus as  rosmhvalr  in Iceland and  rostungr  in Greenland  walruses were by now extinct in Iceland and Norway  while the word evolved on in Greenland   Several place names in Iceland  Greenland and Norway may originate from walrus sites  Hvalfjord  Hvallatrar and Hvalsnes to name some  all being typical walrus breeding grounds   The archaic English word for walrus—morse—is widely thought to have come from the Slavic languages  which in turn loaned it from Finno Ugric languages  Compare морж  morž  in Russian  mursu in Finnish  moršâ in Saami  and morse in French  Olaus Magnus  who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539  first referred to the walrus as the ros marus  probably a Latinization of morž  and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature   The coincidental similarity between morse and the Latin word morsus   a bite   supposedly contributed to the walrus s reputation as a  terrible monster    The compound Odobenus comes from odous  Greek for  tooth   and baino  Greek for  walk    based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water  The term divergens in Latin means  turning apart   referring to their tusks   2  Taxonomy and evolution  The walrus is a mammal in the order Carnivora  It is the sole surviving member of the family Odobenidae  one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals  Phocidae  and eared seals  Otariidae   While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic  i e  descended from a single ancestor  or diphyletic  recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears  Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago  while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago  Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family  including at least twenty species in the Imagotariinae  Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies  The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt suction feeding mechanism  tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae  of which the modern walrus is the last remaining  relict  species   Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized  the Atlantic walrus  O  r  rosmarus  Linnaeus  1758  and the Pacific walrus  O  r  divergens  Illiger  1815   Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow  but relatively recent separation  estimated at 500 000 and 785 000 years ago  These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic  From there  it presumably recolonized the North Pacific Ocean during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway   An isolated population in the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities  including many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World  to be a third subspecies  O  r  laptevi  Chapskii  1940   and is managed as such in Russia  Where the subspecies separation is not accepted  whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate until 2009  when multiple lines of molecular evidence showed it to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus   3  Anatomy  While some outsized Pacific males can weigh as much as   most weigh between   An occasional male of the Pacific subspecies far exceeds normal dimensions  In 1909  a walrus hide weighing was collected from an enormous bull in Franz Josef Land  while in August 1910  Jack Woodson shot a long walrus  harvesting its hide  Since a walrus s hide usually accounts for about 20% of its body weight  the total body mass of these two giants is estimated to have been at least   The Atlantic subspecies weighs about 10–20% less than the Pacific subspecies  Male Atlantic Walrus weigh an average of   The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened snout  Females weigh about two thirds as much as males  with the Atlantic females averaging   sometimes weighing as little as   and the Pacific female averaging   Length typically ranges from   Newborn walruses are already quite large  averaging in weight and in length across both sexes and subspecies  All told  the Walrus is the third largest pinniped species  after the two elephant seals  Walruses maintain such a high body weight because of the blubber stored underneath their skin  This blubber keeps them warm and the fat provides energy to the walrus   The walrus s body shape shares features with both sea lions  eared seals  Otariidae  and seals  true seals  Phocidae   As with otariids  it can turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours  however  its swimming technique is more like that of true seals  relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements  Also like phocids  it lacks external ears   The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed  This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction  However  vision in this species appears to be more suited for short range   3 1  Tusks and dentition  The most prominent feature of the walrus is its long tusks  These are elongated canines  which are present in both male and female walruses and can reach a length of 1 m  3 ft 3 in  and weigh up to 5 4 kg  12 lb   Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males  which use them for fighting  dominance and display  the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups  Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice  Tusks were once thought to be used to dig out prey from the seabed  but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging  While the dentition of walruses is highly variable  they generally have relatively few teeth other than the tusks  The maximal number of teeth is 38 with dentition formula    but over half of the teeth are rudimentary and occur with less than 50% frequency  such that a typical dentition includes only 18 teeth  3 2  Vibrissae  Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles   mystacial vibrissae    giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance  There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching 30 cm  12 in  in length  though in the wild they are often worn to much shorter lengths due to constant use in foraging  The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves  making them highly sensitive organs capable of differentiating shapes thick and wide   3 3  Skin  Aside from the vibrissae  the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald  Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick  up to around the neck and shoulders of males  The blubber layer beneath is up to thick  Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon colored as they age  Old males  in particular  become nearly pink  Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water  the walrus can appear almost white when swimming  As a secondary sexual characteristic  males also acquire significant nodules  called  bosses   particularly around the neck and shoulders   The walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a floatation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water and sleep  The males possess a large baculum  penis bone   up to in length  the largest of any land mammal  both in absolute size and relative to body size   4  Life history  4 1  Reproduction  Walruses live to about 20–30 years old in the wild  The males reach sexual maturity as early as seven years  but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age  They rut from January through April  decreasing their food intake dramatically  The females begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old  The females are polyestrous  coming into heat in late summer and also around February  yet the males are fertile only around February  the potential fertility of this second period is unknown  Breeding occurs from January to March  peaking in February  Males aggregate in the water around ice bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays  The females join them and copulate in the water   Gestation lasts 15 to 16 months  The first three to four months are spent with the blastula in suspended development before it implants itself in the uterus  This strategy of delayed implantation  common among pinnipeds  presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season  determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival  Calves are born during the spring migration  from April to June  They weigh at birth and are able to swim  The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning  but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers  Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned  females give birth at most every two years  leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped   4 2  Migration  The rest of the year  late summer and fall   walruses tend to form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops  The migration between the ice and the beach can be long distance and dramatic  In late spring and summer  for example  several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait   5  Ecology  5 1  Range and habitat  The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia  around Wrangel Island  in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska  and in the waters between those locations  Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula  and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska  west of the Alaska Peninsula  In the spring and fall  walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait  reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr  They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula  and along the southern coast of Alaska  A 28 000 year old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay  indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age  There were roughly 200 000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent  1990  census based estimate   The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic  across Greenland  Svalbard  and the western part of Arctic Russia  There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses  based largely on their geographical distribution and movements  five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland  The Atlantic walrus once ranged south to Cape Cod  Massachusetts  and as late as the eighteenth century was found in large numbers in the greater Gulf of St  Lawrence region  sometimes in colonies of up to 7 000 to 8 000 individuals  This population was nearly eradicated by commercial harvest  their current numbers  though difficult to estimate  probably remain below 20 000  In April 2006  the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in Quebec  New Brunswick  Nova Scotia  Newfoundland and Labrador as having been eradicated in Canada   The isolated population of Laptev walruses is confined year round to the central and western regions of the Laptev Sea  the eastmost regions of the Kara Sea  and the westmost regions of the East Siberian Sea  The current population of these walruses has been estimated to be between 5 000 and 10 000   The limited diving abilities of walruses brings them to depend on shallow waters  and the nearby ice floes  for reaching their food supply   5 2  Diet  Walruses prefer shallow shelf regions and forage primarily on the sea floor  often from sea ice platforms  They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds  their deepest recorded dives are around 80 m  260 ft   They can remain submerged for as long as half an hour   The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet  feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms  including shrimp  crabs  tube worms  soft corals  tunicates  sea cucumbers  various mollusks  and even parts of other pinnipeds  However  it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks  especially clams  for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom  searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements  The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston like tongue rapidly into its mouth  creating a vacuum  The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted  enabling effective suction   Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus  its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities  It disturbs  bioturbates  the sea floor  releasing nutrients into the water column  encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos   Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific  but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is under debate  There have been isolated observations of walruses preying on seals up to the size of a bearded seal  Rarely  incidents of walruses preying on seabirds  particularly the Brünnich s Guillemot Uria lomvia  have been documented  Walruses may occasionally prey on ice entrapped narwhals and scavenge on whale carcasses but there is little evidence to prove this   5 3  Predation  Due to its great size and tusks  the walrus has only two natural predators  the killer whale  orca  and the polar bear  The walrus does not  however  comprise a significant component of either predator s diets  Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves  The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus  typically younger or infirm animals  The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice  However  even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear  and direct attacks are rare  Walruses have been known to fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage  Polar bear–walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting  and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus  Orcas regularly attack walrus  although walruses are believed to have successfully defended themselves via counterattack against the larger cetacean  However  orcas have been observed successfully attacking walruses with few or no injuries   6  Relation to humans  6 1  Conservation  In the 18th and 19th centuries  the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European sealers and whalers  leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population  Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range  although Chukchi  Yupik and Inuit peoples continue to kill small numbers towards the end of each summer   Traditional hunters used all parts of the walrus  The meat  often preserved  is an important winter nutrition source  the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring  tusks and bone were historically used for tools  as well as material for handicrafts  the oil was rendered for warmth and light  the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings  and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas  While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies  walrus meat remains an important part of local diets  and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form   Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in Russia  the United States  Canada  and Denmark  and representatives of the respective hunting communities  An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific walruses are harvested in Alaska and in Russia  including a significant portion  about 42%  of struck and lost animals  Several hundred are removed annually around Greenland  The sustainability of these levels of harvest is difficult to determine given uncertain population estimates and parameters such as fecundity and mortality  The Boone and Crockett Big Game Record book has entries for Atlantic and Pacific walrus  The recorded largest tusks are just over 30 inches and 37 inches long respectively   The effects of global climate change are another element of concern  The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years  The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period  Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds  This more widely separates lactating females from their calves  increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates  Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska  However  there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends   Currently  two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as  least concern  by the IUCN  while the third is  data deficient   The Pacific walrus is not listed as  depleted  according to the Marine Mammal Protection Act nor as  threatened  or  endangered  under the Endangered Species Act  The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2  decreasing  and Category 3  rare  in the Russian Red Book  Global trade in walrus ivory is restricted according to a CITES Appendix 3 listing   6 2  Culture  The walrus plays an important role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples  Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies  and the animal appears frequently in legends  For example  in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven  in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter  the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and  as she drops into the water  she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus  According to various legends  the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids  This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea  who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna  Both in Chukotka and Alaska  the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence  the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head   Because of its distinctive appearance  great bulk  and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks  the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal  particularly in English children s literature  Perhaps its best known appearance is in Lewis Carroll s whimsical poem  The Walrus and the Carpenter  that appears in his 1871 book Through the Looking Glass  In the poem  the eponymous antiheroes use trickery to consume a great number of oysters  Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus s appetite for bivalve mollusks  oysters  primarily nearshore and intertidal inhabitants  in fact comprise an insignificant portion of its diet  even in captivity   The  walrus  in the cryptic Beatles song I Am the Walrus is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem   Another appearance of the walrus in literature is in the story  The White Seal  in Rudyard Kipling s The Jungle Book  where it is the  old Sea Vitch—the big  ugly  bloated  pimpled  fat necked  long tusked walrus of the North Pacific  who has no manners except when he is asleep    7
