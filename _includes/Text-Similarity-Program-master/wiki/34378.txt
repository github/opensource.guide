The letter yogh     Middle English    was used in Middle English and Older Scots  representing y    and various velar phonemes  It was derived from the Old English form of the letter g   In Middle English writing  tailed z came to be indistinguishable from yogh   In Middle Scots the character yogh became confused with a cursive z and the early Scots printers often used z when yogh was not available in their fonts  Consequently  some Lowland Scots words have a z in place of a yogh   Yogh is shaped similarly to the Arabic numeral three  3   which is sometimes substituted for the character in online reference works  There is some confusion about the letter in the literature  as the English language was far from standardised at the time  The upper and lower case letters      are represented in Unicode by code points and respectively   1  Pronunciation  Yogh is pronounced either     with a short o  or       with a long o  It stood for and its various allophones—including and the voiced velar fricative —as well as the phoneme   in modern English spelling    In Middle English  it also stood for the phoneme and its allophone  ç  as in   night   then pronounced as spelled     Sometimes  yogh stood for or   as in the word    yowling    In Middle Scots  it represented the sound in the clusters   and written l and n  Yogh was also used for rather than y   In medieval Cornish manuscripts  yogh was used to represent the voiced interdental fricative   as in   now written   pronounced    2  History  2 1  Old English  The original Germanic g sound was expressed by the Gyfu rune in the Anglo Saxon futhorc  which is itself rendered as in modern transliteration   Following palatalization  both gyfu and Latin g in Old English expressed the  j  sound before front vowels  For example   year  was written as gear  even though the word had never had a g sound  deriving from Proto Germanic *jērą    With the re introduced possibility of a  g  sound before front vowels  notably in the form of loanwords from the Old Norse  such as gere from Norse gervi  Modern English gear   this orthographical state of affairs became a source for confusion  and a distinction of  real g    g   from  palatalized g    j   became desirable   In the Old English period  the glyph was simply the way Latin g was written in the Uncial script introduced at the Christianization of England by the Irish missionaries  It only came to be used as a letter distinct from g in the Middle English period   2 2  Middle English  Norman scribes despised non Latin characters and certain spellings in English and therefore replaced the yogh with the digraph gh  still  the variety of pronunciations persisted  as evidenced by cough  taught  and though  The process of replacing the yogh with gh was slow  and was not fully completed until the end of the fifteenth century  Not every English word that contains a gh was originally spelled with a yogh  for example  spaghetti is Italian  where the h makes the g hard  i e   instead of    ghoul is Arabic  in which the gh was    The medieval author Orm used this letter in three ways when writing Early Middle English  By itself  it represented   so he used this letter for the y in  yet   Doubled  it represented   so he ended his spelling of  may  with two yoghs  Finally  the digraph of yogh followed by an h represented    In Melibeus  Chaucer wrote   Ȝe haue cast alle here wordes in an hochepoche    In the late Middle English period  yogh was no longer used  came to be spelled night  Middle English re imported G in its French form for    2 3  Scots  In words of French and Gaelic origin  the Early Scots palatal consonant had become or in some cases   and the palatal consonant had become by the Middle Scots period  Those were variously written     or   and   or   By the Modern Scots period the yogh had been replaced by the character z  in particular for    n  and  l   written nz and lz  The original and developed into in some words such as etland or Zetland for Shetland  Yogh was also used to represent in words such as    yesterday  and but by the Modern Scots period y had replaced yogh  The pronunciation of MacKenzie  and its variant spellings   originally pronounced   shows where yogh became zed  but the sound did not change  Menzies Campbell is another example   2 4  After the development of printing  In Middle Scots orthography the use of yogh became confused with a cursive z and the early Scots printers often used z when yogh was not available in their fonts   The glyph yogh can be found in surnames that start with Y in Scotland and Ireland  such as the surname Yeoman and sometimes letter z  spelled   Because the shape of the yogh was identical to some forms of the handwritten z   In Unicode 1 0 the character yogh was mistakenly unified with the quite different character Ezh      and yogh itself was not added to Unicode until version 3 0   3  List of words containing a yogh  These are examples of
