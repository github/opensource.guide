The Peloponnesian League was an alliance in the Peloponnesus from the 6th to the 4th centuries BC  It is known mainly for being one of the two rivals in the Peloponnesian War  431–404 BC    1  Early history  By the end of the 7th century BC Sparta had become the most powerful city state in the Peloponnese and was the political and military hegemon over Argos  the next most powerful city state  Sparta acquired two powerful allies  Corinth and Elis  also city states   by ridding Corinth of tyranny  and helping Elis secure control of the Olympic Games  Sparta continued to aggressively use a combination of foreign policy and military intervention to gain other allies  Sparta defeated Tegea in a frontier war and offered them a permanent defensive alliance  this was the turning point for Spartan foreign policy  Many other states in the central and provincial northern Peloponnese joined the league  which eventually included all Peloponnesian states except Argos and Achaea   2  League organization  The league was organized with Sparta as the hegemon  and was controlled by the council of allies which was composed of two bodies  the assembly of Spartiates and the Congress of Allies  Each allied state had one vote in the Congress  regardless of that state s size or geopolitical power  No tribute was paid except in times of war  when one third of the military of a state could be requested  Only Sparta could call a Congress of the League  All alliances were made with Sparta only  so if they so wished  member states had to form separate alliances with each other  And although each state had one vote  League resolutions were not binding on Sparta  Thus  the Peloponnesian League was not an  alliance  in the strictest sense of the word  nor was it wholly Peloponnesian for the entirety of its existence    The league provided protection and security to its members  It was a conservative alliance which supported Oligarchies and opposed tyrannies and democracies   3  Later history of the League  After the Persian Wars the League was expanded into the Hellenic League and included Athens and other states  The Hellenic League was led by Pausanias and  after he was recalled  by Cimon of Athens  Sparta withdrew from the Hellenic League  reforming the Peloponnesian League with its original allies  The Hellenic League then turned into the Athenian led Delian League  This might have been caused by Sparta and its allies  unease over Athenian efforts to increase their power  The two Leagues eventually came into conflict with each other in the Peloponnesian War  Under Spartan leadership  the League defeated Athens and its allies in 404 BC   Following the disastrous Spartan defeat by Thebes at the Battle of Leuktra in 371 BC  Elis and the Arcadian states seized the opportunity to throw off the yoke of Spartan hegemony  the Arcadians formed themselves into their own league to preserve their independence  The size of the Peloponnesian League was then further reduced by the Theban liberation of Messenia from Spartan control in 369 BC  The states of the north eastern Peloponnese  including Corinth  Sicyon and Epidauros  adhered to their Spartan allegiance  but as the war continued in the 360s BC  many joined the Thebans or took a neutral position  though Elis and some of the Arcadian states realigned themselves with Sparta  In 338 BC  the Peloponnesian League was disbanded when Philip II of Macedon  father of Alexander the Great  formed the League of Corinth after defeating Thebes and Athens  incorporating all the Peloponnesian states except Sparta   4  External links    by Jona Lendering
