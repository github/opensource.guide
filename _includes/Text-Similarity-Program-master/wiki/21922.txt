Neoteny   or    also called juvenilization  is one of the two ways by which paedomorphism can arise  Paedomorphism or paedomorphosis is the retention by adults of traits previously seen only in the young  and is a subject studied in the field of developmental biology  Paedomorphism can also be the retention of larval traits which is commonly studied in salamanders  In neoteny  the physiological  or somatic  development of an organism  typically an animal  is slowed or delayed  In contrast  in progenesis  sexual development occurs faster  Both processes result in paedomorphism  a type of heterochrony  Ultimately this process results in the retention  in the adults of a species  of juvenile physical characteristics well into maturity and pedogenesis  paedogenesis   the reproduction in a neotenized state   Neoteny is one of three dimensions of heterochrony  or the change in timing of developmental events  acceleration  faster  vs  neoteny  slower   hypermorphosis  further  vs  progenesis  not as far   and predisplacement  begins earlier  vs  postdisplacement  begins later    The word neoteny is borrowed from the German Neotenie  the latter constructed from the Greek νέος  neos   young   and τείνειν  teínein   to extend    The adjective form of the word is either  neotenic  or  neotenous   For the opposite of  neotenic   different authorities use either  gerontomorphic  or  peramorphic    1  In humans  1 1  Neotenic traits in humans  Various sources identify the following   Head  globular skull  thinness of skull bones  reduction of brow ridge  large brain  flattened face  broadened face  hairless face  hair on  top of  the head  larger eyes  ear shape  small nose  small teeth  small maxilla  upper jaw  and mandible  lower jaw   Glabrousness  hairless body   Genitals  absence of baculum  penis bone   presence of hymen  forward facing vagina  Limbs Posture  limbs proportionately short compared to torso length  longer leg than arm length  structure of the foot  upright stance  1 2  Human evolution  Many prominent evolutionary theorists propose that neoteny has been a key feature in human evolution  Stephen Jay Gould believed that the  evolutionary story  of humans is one where we have been  retaining to adulthood the originally juvenile features of our ancestors   J  B  S  Haldane mirrors Gould s hypothesis by stating a  major evolutionary trend in human beings  is  greater prolongation of childhood and retardation of maturity   Delbert D  Thiessen said that  neoteny becomes more apparent as early primates evolved into later forms  and that primates have been  evolving toward flat face   However  in light of some groups using arguments based around neoteny to support racism  Gould also argued  that the whole enterprise of ranking groups by degree of neoteny is fundamentally unjustified   Gould  1996  pg  150    Doug Jones  a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University  said that human evolution s trend toward neoteny may have been caused by sexual selection for neotenous facial traits in women by men with the resulting neoteny in male faces being a  by product  of sexual selection for neotenous female faces  Jones said that this type of sexual selection  likely  had a major role in human evolution once a larger proportion of women lived past the age of menopause  This increasing proportion of women who were too old to reproduce resulted in a greater variance in fecundity in the population of women  and it resulted in a greater sexual selection for indicators of youthful fecundity in women by men   Ashley Montagu said that the fetalized pithecanthropine represented by the juvenile Mojokerto skull and the fetalized australopithecine represented by the juvenile Australopithecus africanus skull would have had skulls with a closer resemblance to those of modern humans than to those of the adult forms of their own species  Montagu further listed the roundness of the skull  thinness of the skull bones  lack of brow ridges  lack of sagittal crests  form of the teeth  relative size of the brain and form of the brain as ways in which the juvenile skulls of these human ancestors resemble the skulls of adult modern humans  Montagu said that the retention of these juvenile characteristics of the skull into adulthood by australopithecine or pithecanthropine could have been a way that a modern type of human could have evolved earlier than what actually happened in human evolution   Stanley Greenspan and Stuart G  Shanker proposed a theory in The First Idea of psychological development in which neoteny is seen as crucial for the  development of species typical capacities  that depend upon a long period of attachment to caregivers for the opportunities to engage in and develop their capacity for emotional communication  Because of the importance of facial expression in the process of interactive signaling  neotenous features  such as hair loss  allow for more efficient and rapid communication of socially important messages that are based on facially expressive emotional signaling   Other theorists have argued that neoteny has not been the main cause of human evolution  because humans only retain some juvenile traits  while relinquishing others  For example  the high leg to body ratio  long legs  of adult humans as opposed to human infants shows that there is not a holistic trend in humans towards neoteny when compared to the other great apes  Andrew Arthur Abbie agrees  citing the gerontomorphic fleshy human nose and long human legs as contradicting the neoteny hominid evolution hypothesis  although he does believe humans are generally neotenous  Brian K  Hall also cites the long legs of humans as a peramorphic trait  which is in sharp contrast to neoteny   On the balance  an all or nothing approach could be regarded as pointless  with a combination of heterochronic processes being more likely and more reasonable  Vrba  1996    1 3  Growth pattern of children  Desmond Collins who was an Extension Lecturer of Archaeology at London University said that the lengthened youth period of humans is part of neoteny   Physical anthropologist Barry Bogin said that the pattern of children s growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness  Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete  when  dental maturation is only 58 percent complete  and when  reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete   Bogin said that this allometry of human growth allows children to have a  superficially infantile  appearance  large skull  small face  small body and sexual underdevelopment  longer than in other  mammalian species   Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a  nurturing  and  care giving  response in  older individuals    1 4  Neotenous features elicit help  The Multiple Fitness Model proposes that the qualities that make babies appear cute to adults additionally look  desirable  to adults when they see other adults  Neotenous features in adult females may help elicit more resource investment and nurturing from adult males  Likewise  neotenous features in adult males may similarly help elicit more resource investment and nurturing from adult females in addition to possibly making neotenous adult males appear less threatening and possibly making neotenous adult males more able to elicit resources from  other resource rich people   Therefore  it could be adaptive for adult females to be attracted to adult males that have  some  neotenous traits   Caroline F  Keating et al  tested the hypothesis that adult male and female faces with more neotenous features would elicit more help than adult male and female faces with less neotenous features  Keating et al  digitally modified photographs of faces of African Americans and European Americans to make them appear more or less neotenous by either enlarging the size of their eyes and lips or decreasing the size of their eyes and lips  Keating et al  said that the more neotenous white male  white female and black female faces elicited more help from people in the United States and Kenya  but the difference in help from people in the United States and Kenya for more neotenous black male faces was not significantly different from less neotenous black male faces   1 5  Brain  Helmuth Nyborg said that a testable hypothesis can be made using the GTC A E model with regards to  neoteny   Nyborg said that the hypothesis is that  feminized   slower maturing   neotenic   androtypes  will differ from  masculinized   faster maturing  androtypes  by having bigger brains  more fragile skulls  bigger hips  narrower shoulders  less physical strength  live in cities  as opposed to living in the countryside  and by receiving higher performance scores on ability tests  Nyborg said that if the predictions made by this hypothesis are true  then the  material basis  of the differences would be  explained   Nyborg said that some ecological situations would favor the survival and reproduction of the  masculinized   faster maturing  androtypes  due to their  sheer brutal force  while other ecological situations would favor the survival and reproduction of the  feminized   slower maturing   neotenic   androtypes  due to their  subtle tactics    Aldo Poiani who is an evolutionary ecologist at Monash University  Australia  said that he agrees that neoteny in humans may have become  accelerated  through  two way sexual selection  whereby females have been choosing smart males as mates and males have been choosing smart females as mates   Neoteny has been important to human evolution  because it has increased the maturation period and the size of the human brain  Two to three million years ago  there was an  incomplete segmental duplication of  the  ancestral SRGAP2  gene in the ancestors of humans  This new gene  SRGAC2  slowed spine maturation and allowed for more neuronal migration  As a result  the dendrite spines increased in number and length  and they became  more complex   This accounts for the greater synaptic densities in humans when compared to other primates and rodents   Somel et al  said that 48% of the genes that affect the development of the prefrontal cortex change with age differently between humans and chimpanzees  Somel et al  said that there is a  significant excess of genes  related to the development of the prefrontal cortex that show  neotenic expression in humans  relative to chimpanzees and rhesus macaques  Somel et al  said that this difference was in accordance with the neoteny hypothesis of human evolution   Humans have been evolving toward greater  psychological neoteny   Dr  Bruce Charlton  a Newcastle University psychology professor  said what looks like immaturity — or in his terms  the “retention of youthful attitudes and behaviors into later adulthood” — is actually a valuable developmental characteristic  which he calls psychological neoteny  Highly educated people and eminent scientists demonstrate more neotenous psychological traits  In fact  the ability of an adult human to learn is considered a neotenous trait  Physical neotenization in humans has  likewise  caused psychologically neotenous traits in humans  curiosity  playfulness  affection  sociality and an innate desire to cooperate   1 6  Between sexes  Ashley Montagu said that the following neotenous traits are in women when compared to men  more delicate skeleton  smoother ligament attachments  smaller mastoid processes  reduced brow ridges  more forward tilt of the head  narrower joints  less hairy  retention of fetal body hair  smaller body size  more backward tilt of pelvis  greater longevity  lower basal metabolism  faster heartbeat  greater extension of development periods  higher pitched voice and larger tear ducts   Cro Magnon humans  40 000 to 10 000 years ago  differed from co existing Neanderthals in the following ways   higher forehead  less prominent brow ridges  smaller teeth  less robust bodies  and reduced sexual dimorphism    1 6 1  Attractive women s faces  In a cross cultural study  more neotenized female faces were the most attractive to men while less neotenized female faces were the least attractive to men  regardless of the females  actual age  Using a panel of Asian  Hispanic and White judges  Michael R  Cunningham found that the Asian  Hispanic and white female faces found most attractive were those that had  neonate large eyes  greater distance between eyes  and small noses  and his study led him to conclude that  large eyes  were the most  effective  of the  neonate cues   Cunningham also said that  shiny  hair may be indicative of  neonate vitality    Cunningham said that there was a  difference  in the preferences of Asian and White judges  Cunningham said that Asian judges preferred women with  less mature faces  and smaller mouths than the White judges  Cunningham hypothesized that this difference in preference may stem from  ethnocentrism  since  Asian faces possess those qualities   so Cunningham re analyzed the data with  11 Asian targets excluded  and he concluded that  ethnocentrism was not a primary determinant of Asian preferences   Using a panel of Blacks and Whites as judges  Cunningham said that more neotenous faces were perceived as having both higher  femininity  and  sociability    In contrast  Cunningham said that faces that were  low in neoteny  were judged as  intimidating   Upon analyzing the results of his study Cunningham concluded that preference for  neonate features may display the least cross cultural variability  in terms of  attractiveness ratings   In a study of Italian women who have won beauty competitions  the study said that the women had faces characterized by more  babyness  traits compared to the  normal  women used as a reference  In a study of sixty Caucasian female faces  the average facial composite of the fifteen faces considered most attractive differed from the facial composite of the whole by having a reduced lower facial region  a thinner jaw  and a higher forehead   Doug Jones  a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University  said that there is cross cultural evidence for preference for facial neoteny in women  because of sexual selection for the appearance of youthful fecundity in women by men  Jones said that men are more concerned about women s sexual attractiveness than women are concerned about men s sexual attractiveness  Jones said that this greater concern over female attractiveness is unusual among animals  because it is usually the females that are more concerned with the male s sexual attractiveness in other species  Jones said that this anomalous case in humans is due to women living past their reproductive years and due to women having their reproductive capacity diminish with age  resulting in the adaption in men to be selective against physical traits of age that indicate lessening female fecundity  Jones said that the neoteny in women s faces may be a  by product  of men s attraction to indicators of  youthful fecundity  in  adult females    A similar study was conducted on the attractiveness of males with the subject of the skull and its application in human morphology Paul Wehr and team  2001  utilized psychology and evolutionary biology to understand selection on facial features  Averageness has been a result of stabilizing selection whereas facial paedomorphosis or juvenile traits are a result of directional selection  Wehr  2001   It is necessary at this point to define several terms to put them into practical time and space  as they pertain to this argument  The idea of directional selection as defined by Bergstrom and Dugatkin  2012  is when a single phenotypic trait is driven by selection toward fixation in a population  Bergstrom and Dugatkin  p  218   In contrast  stabilizing selection is defined as being a scenario wherein both alleles are driven toward fixation in a population  or polymorphic  both alleles reaching equilibrium at a fixation   Bergstrom and Dugatkin  p  221   To compare the effects of directional and stabilizing selection on facial paedomorphosis Wehr used graphic morphing to alter appearances to make faces appear more or less juvenile  The results concluded that the effect of averageness was preferred nearly twice over juvenile trait characteristics which indicates that stabilizing selection influences facial preference  and averageness was found more attractive than the retention of juvenile facial characteristics  Wehr  2001   This follows the conclusions of the other study presented previously  It was perplexing to find that women tend to prefer the average facial features over the juvenile  because in animals the females tend to drive sexual selection by female choice and the Red Queen hypothesis  Some may hypothesize this is because in humans women tend to focus on social features including education  job status  family background  humor  and courtships  Experiments have found males tend to focus on the attractiveness of women  whereas women focus of overall quality and verbal interactions   1 7  Between races and among primates  Stephen Jay Gould objected to the ranking of races as more or less neotenous  but Gould argued that if one used the terms set forth by 1920s proponents of racial neoteny   Asians  are  clearly  the most neotenized human race   Ashley Montagu said that the  Mongoloid skull  whether Chinese or Japanese  is the most neotenized human skull  Montagu further said that the  European  skull was less neotenized than the Mongoloid  with the  Australian Aborigine  skull less neotenized than the European and the Neanderthal skull even less neotenized than the Australian Aborigine skull  Montagu said that humans have more neotenized skulls than Australopithecus   Delbert D  Thiessen said that Homo sapiens are more neotenized than Homo erectus  Homo erectus was more neotenized than Australopithecus  Great Apes are more neotenized than Old World monkeys and Old World monkeys are more neotenized than New World monkeys   Nancy Lynn Barrickman said that Brian T  Shea concluded by multivariate analysis that Bonobos are more neotenized than the common chimpanzee  taking into account such features as the proportionately long torso length of the Bonobo  Ashley Montagu said that part of the differences seen in the morphology of  modernlike types of man  can be attributed to different rates of  neotenous mutations  in their early populations   1 7 1  San people  Ashley Montagu said that the San have the following neotenous traits relative to Caucasoids  large brain  light skin pigment  less hairy  round headed  bulging forehead  small cranial sinuses  flat roof of the nose  small face  small mastoid processes  wide eye separation  median eye fold  short stature and horizontal penis   M  R  Drennan of the Department of Anatomy  University of Cape Town  said that the Bushman s skull retains infantile morphological characteristics into adulthood that are only transiently present in the juvenile forms of other races  Drennan further said that the common description of an infant s skull from anatomy textbooks  epitomizes  the characteristics of the Bushman s skull   Phillip V  Tobias of the Department of Anatomy  University of Witwatersrand  said that there are two phenotypical patterns in occipital curvature of  African crania   one for  Negroes  and one for Bushmen  Tobias said that the skulls of Bushmen retain strongly curved occiputs from youth into adulthood  but the curved occiputs of  Negro  skulls start to flatten when their first permanent teeth erupt  Tobias said that this flattening process in  Negroes  continues until their occiputs have flattened as adults  Tobias said that there are  infantile  features in the cranial morphology of Bushmen   Marina L  Sardi of the anthropological division at the University of La Plata  Argentina  and Fernando V  Ramírez Rozzi said South African adults have neotenized relative facial heights and nose shapes in comparison to European adults  because  Europeans  develop relatively taller faces and relatively taller and narrower noses as they mature whereas  South Africans  do not undergo this ontogenic change as they mature  However  the relative length of both the tibia and the femur to the torso becomes greater in South Africans as they mature to a greater extent than in Europeans  so the relatively shorter legs of European adults are neotenous in comparison to the greater limb to torso ratio of South African adults   1 7 2  Mongoloids  Ashley Montagu said   The Mongoloid skull has proceeded further than in any other people    The Mongoloid skull  whether Chinese or Japanese  has been rather more neotenized than the Caucasoid or European    The female skull  it will be noted  is more pedomorphic in all human populations than the male skull    In Montagu s list of   n eotenous structural traits in which Mongoloids    differ from Caucasoids   Montagu lists  Larger brain  larger braincase  broader skull  broader face  flat roof of the nose  inner eye fold  more protuberant eyes  lack of brow ridges  greater delicacy of bones  shallow mandibular fossa  small mastoid processes  stocky build  persistence of thymus gland into adult life  persistence of juvenile form of zygomatic muscle  persistence of juvenile form of superior lip muscle  later eruption of full dentition  except second and third molars   less hairy  fewer sweat glands  fewer hairs per square centimeter  and  long torso    An interpretation of a claim by zoologist Clive Bromhall is that  Mongoloid races are explained in terms of being the most extreme pedomorphic humans    Richard Grossinger said   The intuition that advanced human development was pedomorphic rather than recapitulationary and accelerated was disturbing to many Eurocentric nineteenth century anthropologists    If juvenilization was the characteristic for advanced status  then it was clear that the Mongoloid races were more deeply fetalized in most respects and thus capable of the greatest development    Stephen Oppenheimer said   An interesting hypothesis put forward by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould many years ago was that the package of the Mongoloid anatomical changes could be explained by the phenomenon of neoteny  whereby an infantile or childlike body form is preserved in adult life  Neoteny in hominids is still one of the simplest explanations of how we developed a disproportionately large brain so rapidly over the past few million years  The relatively large brain and the forward rotation of the skull on the spinal column  and body hair loss  both characteristic of humans  are found in foetal chimps  Gould suggested a mild intensification of neoteny in Mongoloids  in whom it has been given the name pedomorphy  Such a mechanism is likely to involve only a few controller genes and could therefore happen over a relatively short evolutionary period  It would also explain how the counterintuitive retroussé  turned up at the end  nose and relative loss of facial hair got into the package     D ecrease unnecessary muscle bulk  less tooth mass  thinner bones and smaller physical size     this follows the selective adaptive model of Mongoloid evolution    Paul Storm of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center  Netherlands  said that in Australasia there are two types of cranial morphologies—the  Sunda   Mongoloid  and  Sahul   Australoid  types  Storm said that the  Sunda   Mongoloid  type includes Chinese and Javanese people  and he said that the  Sahul   Australoid  type includes Papuans and Australian aborigines  Storm said that the  Sunda   Mongoloid  type has a flat face with high cheek bones  and Storm said that this  flat face  of the Chinese and Javanese is known as the  mongoloid face   Storm further said that the  Sunda   Mongoloid  type has a more rounded skull   feminine  juvenile  characters   a  retention of juvenile characters  and a limited outgrowth of superstructures such as the supraorbital region  Storm said that  Sunda   Mongoloid  skulls resemble female skulls more than  Sahul   Australoid  skulls resemble female skulls  Storm said that the skulls of  Asian  males   Chinese and Javanese   have  more feminine characteristics   and he said that they have  many feminine characters in contrast with Australians    Paul Storm said that Asia contained humans with  generalized  cranial morphology  but between 20 000 BP and 12 000 BP this generalized type disappeared as a new type emerged  This new type had a flatter face with more pronounced cheekbones  a more rounded head  reduced sexual dimorphism  male skulls started to resemble female skulls   a reduction of supestructures such as the supraorbital region and an increased  retention of juvenile characters   Storm said that this new type of skull that emerged is called the  Proto Sunda   Proto Mongoloid  type  and it is distinguished from the  Sunda   Mongoloid  type by being more  robust   Storm said that the  Mongoloid  or  Asian  type of skull developed relatively fast during a population bottleneck in Asia that happened during the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene through a microevolutionary trend that involved a  continuation of neoteny and gracilisation trends   Due to different courses of evolution  Storm said that these two types of skulls  the  Sunda   Mongoloid  type and the  Sahul   Australoid  type  are now clearly recognizable at the present time   Andrew Arthur Abbie who was an anatomist and anthropologist at the University of Adelaide talked about leg to torso length being related to neoteny  Abbie said that women normally have shorter legs than men  and he said that shorter legs are the normal condition in some ethnic groups such as Mongoloids  Abbie said that Mongoloids of whom he listed the people of  China  Japan and the Americas  have proportionately larger heads and shorter legs than Europeans  and he said that this is a case of  paedomorphism   Abbie said that aboriginal Australians and some African ethnic groups such as the  Negro   the  Hottentot  and the  Nubian  peoples have proportionately longer legs than Europeans  and he said that this is a case of  gerontomorphism   Abbie said that ethnic groups with proportionately shorter legs than Europeans are relatively  paedomorphic  in terms of leg to torso ratios when compared to Europeans  and he said that ethnic groups with proportionately longer legs than Europeans are relatively  gerontomorphic  in terms of leg to torso ratios when compared to Europeans   Leonard Halford Dudley Buxton who taught physical anthropology at Oxford University said that in the  Yellow man  the depression of the nose is below the nasion rather than at the place where the nasal bones meet the frontal bone like in the  European races   Buxton said that in the  Yellow man  the nasal bones form a wider angle rather than the narrower angle of the  European races   Buxton said that these features of the nose of the  Yellow man  make it  flatter  and  not unlike that found in European children   Buxton said that  Yellow men  have the  Mongolian fold   and Buxton said that this  fold occurs occasionally in European children  and sometimes even in adults   Buxton said that the presence of the  Mongolian fold  in  Yellow men  is possibly due to the shape of the nose of  Yellow men  that  in some cases resemble that of European children    Zoologist L  Harrison Matthews and primatologist and anatomist William Charles Osman Hill said that Mongoloids have a  high a grade of paedomorphism    1 7 3  Negroids  Ashley Montagu said that Negroids have the following neotenous traits relative to Caucasoids  flattish nose  flat roof of the nose  small ears  narrower joints  frontal skull eminences  later closure of the premaxillary sutures  less hairy  longer eyelashes and cruciform pattern of the lower second and third molars   1 8  Specific neotenies  Populations with a history of dairy farming have evolved to be lactose tolerant in adulthood whereas other populations generally lose the ability to break down lactose as they grow into adults   1 9  Down syndrome  Down syndrome neotenizes the brain and body  Down syndrome is characterized by decelerated maturation  neoteny   incomplete morphogenesis  vestigia  and atavisms   He notes both the physical neoteny of people with Down syndrome   round in shape    bowed legs which tend to be short    slanty eyes   a  long tongue  and  short fingers   and their mental neoteny   unsexual    playful    affectionate    mischievous  and  imitative    2  Neoteny in other species  Neoteny has been observed in many other species  Neoteny in amphibians seems to be the most widely studied aside from humans  many examples of neoteny in amphibians stem from studies done mainly on salamanders  There is also a general prevalence of increased neoteny within domesticated animals like dogs  Neoteny has also been noted in species similar to humans  like chimpanzees  The neotenous traits in chimpanzees that resemble those within humans may give some insight into the evolutionary history of humans  What can be gathered from many studies on neoteny is that organisms with similar lineages tend to neotenize similar features  meaning they retain related features from the juvenile form into adulthood  Finally  there are two main reasons for the occurrence of neoteny  it can either be a result of the benefit of retaining juvenile characteristics due to an environment that favors those characteristics over the adult form  or the retention of juvenile characteristics leads to greater survival because those characteristics are less costly in terms of energy expenditure   It is important to note the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life  this might then provide some insight into the cause of neoteny in those species  Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis  but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form  this can be seen in Lithobates clamitans  Full neoteny is seen in Ambystoma tigrinum  This species is part of a larger group  perrenobranchiates  which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life  This means that they are capable of reproducing and they do not mature into adult forms  The species Rana clamata exhibits partial neoteny when it delays its maturation through the winter season because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available since it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form  This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny  the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly  so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult  Ambystoma tigrinum retains its neotenous features for a similar reason  however the retention is permanent due to the lack of resources available throughout its lifetime  This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form  A few species of birds show partial neoteny  A couple examples of such species are Chiroxiphia linearis and Chiroxiphia caudata  The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood  but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature  In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species  In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times  the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate  In this instance  neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate when the females are not yet prepared   Neoteny is seen more in domesticated animals like dogs and mice  This is because there are more resources available  less competition for those resources  and with the lowered competition the animals expend less energy obtaining those resources  This allows them to mature and reproduce more quickly than their wild counterparts  The environment that domesticated animals are raised in determines whether or not neoteny is present in those animals  Evolutionary neoteny can arise in a species when those conditions occur  and a species becomes sexually mature ahead of its “normal development”  Another explanation for the neoteny in domesticated animals can be the selection for certain behavioral characteristics  Behavior is linked to genetics which therefore means that when a behavioral trait is selected for  a physical trait may also be selected for due to mechanisms like linkage disequilibrium  Often  juvenile behaviors are selected for in order to more easily domesticate a species  aggressiveness in certain species comes with adulthood when there is a need to compete for resources  If there is no need for competition  then there is no need for aggression  Selecting for juvenile behavioral characteristics can lead to neoteny in physical characteristics because  for example  with the reduced need for behaviors like aggression there is no need for developed traits that would help in that area  Traits that may become neotenized due to decreased aggression may be a shorter muzzle and smaller general size among the domesticated individuals  Some common neotenous physical traits in domesticated animals  mainly dogs  pigs  ferrets  cats  and even foxes  include  floppy ears  changes in reproductive cycle  curly tails  piebald coloration  fewer or shortened vertebra  large eyes  rounded forehead  large ears  and shortened muzzle   Neoteny is commonly seen in flightless insects like the females in the order Strepsiptera  The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times  environments that may have contributed to the separate evolution of this trait are  high altitudes  isolation on islands  and insects that reside in colder climates  These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait  because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed  so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal  Also  in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings  thus the circumstance favors flightlessness  Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood  and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings  Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity  this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes  In those instances  neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity  Aphids are a great example of insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting  If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse  When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant aphids may not grow wings and stay there for the duration of their life  however if the resources become diminished the offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants   Two common environments that tend to favor neoteny are high altitude and cool environments because neotenous individuals have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form  This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness  also the conditions favor neoteny due to the ability of neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily  This trend can be seen in the comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes  The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment  Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly  thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults   Many species of salamander  and amphibians in general  are known to have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in  The axolotl is a species of salamander that retains its juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood  which is an excellent example of full neoteny  Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation  an example of this would be a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough skinned newt  both of which retain gills into adulthood  These species are better able to survive when they retain certain juvenile features  like gills  that allow them access to both aquatic and land environments   Pygmy chimpanzees  Bonobos  share many physical characteristics with humans  A prime example are their neotenous skulls  The shape of their skull does not change into adulthood  it only increases in size  This is due to sexual dimorphism and an evolutionary change in timing of development  Juveniles became sexually mature before their bodies had fully developed into adulthood  and due to some selective advantage the neotenic structure of the skull remained in later generations   More examples of neoteny can be seen in these other species   1  Species in which energy costs result in neoteny   The families  Gerridae  Delphacidae  and Carabidae  Many of the insect species within these families have smaller  neotenous wings or no wings at all   Some cricket species which shed their wings in adulthood   Beetles of the genus Ozopemon  the males are thought to be the first known example of neoteny in the order Coleoptera  They are significantly smaller than the females and it is thought that the neoteny in males is linked to the inbreeding within species   Kalotermes flavicollis  a termite that shows neoteny in females during molting   The rook  Corvus frugilegus  the evolution of birds from dinosaurs may be linked to dimorphism through neoteny  2  Species in which the environmental conditions cause neoteny   The Northwestern Salamander  higher altitude causes greater neotenic tendencies  this can be to help conserve energy as mentioned above    A few species of the family Ischnomesidae  crustaceans  These species live in deep ocean waters  this fact may be linked to their neotenous characteristics for the same reasons as in insects at high altitude and in cold environments  which may lead us to conclude that neoteny arises for similar reasons between completely different species   3  See also  Ageing  Cuteness  Sexual selection  4  References  Wehr  Paul  MacDonald  K  Linder  R  Yeung  G
