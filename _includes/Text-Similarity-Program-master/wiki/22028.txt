Nephrology  from Greek νεφρός nephros  kidney   combined with the suffix  logy   the study of   is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the study of normal kidney function  kidney problems  the treatment of kidney problems and renal replacement therapy  dialysis and kidney transplantation   Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys  such as diabetes and autoimmune disease  and systemic problems that occur as a result of kidney problems  such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension  are also studied in nephrology  A physician who has undertaken additional training to become an expert in nephrology may call themselves a nephrologist or renal physician   1  Scope  Nephrology concerns the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases  including electrolyte disturbances and hypertension  and the care of those requiring renal replacement therapy  including dialysis and renal transplant patients  Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself  and may require special treatment  Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides  e g  ANCA vasculitis  and autoimmune diseases  e g   lupus   as well as congenital or genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease   Patients are referred to nephrology specialists for various reasons  such as acute renal failure  chronic kidney disease  hematuria  proteinuria  kidney stones  hypertension  and disorders of acid base or electrolytes   2  Nephrologist  A nephrologist is a physician who has undertaken additional training to become an expert in nephrology  Additionally  due to their unique skills  nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in general internal medicine  transplant medicine  immunosuppression management  intensive care medicine  clinical pharmacology  perioperative medicine  or pediatric nephrology   Nephrologists may further sub specialise in dialysis  kidney transplantation  chronic kidney disease  cancer related kidney diseases  Onconephrology   procedural nephrology or other non nephrology areas as described above   Procedures a nephrologist may perform include native kidney and transplant kidney biopsy  dialysis access insertion  temporary vascular access lines  tunnelled vascular access lines  peritoneal dialysis access lines   fistula management  angiographic or surgical fistulogram and plasty   and    2 1  Training  2 1 1  Australia and New Zealand  Nephrology training in Australia and New Zealand typically includes completion of a medical degree  Bachelor of Medicine  Bachelor of Surgery  4–6 years   internship  1 year   Basic Physician Training  3 years minimum   successful completion of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians written and clinical examinations  and Advanced Physician Training in Nephrology  2–3 years   The training pathway is overseen and accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians  Increasingly  nephrologists may additionally complete of a post graduate degree  usually a PhD  in a nephrology research interest  3–4 years   Finally  all Australian and New Zealand nephrologists participate in career long professional and personal development through the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and other bodies such as the and the    2 1 2  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom  nephrology  or often renal medicine  is a subspecialty of general medicine  A nephrologist has completed medical school  foundation year posts  FY1 and FY2  and core medical training  CMT  and passed the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians  MRCP  exam before competing for a National Training Number  NTN  in renal medicine  The typical subspecialty training is five years and leads to a Certificate of Completion of Training  CCT  in both renal medicine and general  internal  medicine  Subspecialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees  MD PhD    2 1 3  United States  Nephrology training can be accomplished through one of two routes  The first being through an internal medicine pathway leading to an Internal Medicine Nephrology specialty  and sometimes known as  adult nephrology   The second pathway being through Pediatrics leading to a speciality in Pediatric Nephrology  In the United States  after medical school adult nephrologists complete a three year residency in internal medicine followed by a two year  or longer  fellowship in nephrology  Complementary to an adult nephrologist  a pediatric nephrologist will complete a three year pediatric residency after medical school or a four year Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residency  This is followed by a three year fellowship in Pediatic Nephrology  Once training is satisfactorily completed  the physician is eligible to take the American Board of Internal Medicine  ABIM  or American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine  AOBIM  nephrology examination  Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards  To be approved  the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in nephrology in order to qualify to take the board s examination  If a physician passes the examination  then he or she can become a nephrology specialist  Typically  nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an ACGME or AOA accredited fellowship in nephrology  Nearly all programs train nephrologists in continuous renal replacement therapy  fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of plasmapheresis  Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric nephrology  and internal medicine  adult  trained physicians may enter general  adult  nephrology fellowships   3  Diagnosis  History and physical examination are central to the diagnostic workup in nephrology  This may include inquires regarding family history  general medical history  diet  medication use  drug use and occupation  Examination typically includes an assessment of volume state  blood pressure  skin  joints  abdomen and flank   Examination of the urine  urinalysis  allows a direct assessment for possible kidney problems  which may be suggested by appearance of blood in the urine  haematuria   protein in the urine  proteinuria   pus cells in the urine  pyuria  or cancer cells in the urine  A 24 hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss  see proteinuria   urine output  creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules   Basic blood tests can be used to check the concentration of hemoglobin  platelets  sodium  potassium  chloride  bicarbonate  urea  creatinine  calcium  magnesium or phosphate in the blood  All of these may be affected by kidney problems  The serum creatinine concentration can be used to estimate the function of the kidney  called the creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate  GFR   More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections  hepatitis B  hepatitis C   autoimmune conditions  systemic lupus erythematosus  ANCA vasculitis   paraproteinemias  amyloidosis  multiple myeloma  and metabolic diseases  diabetes  cystinosis    Structural abnormalities of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests  These may include Medical ultrasonography ultrasound  computed axial tomography  CT   scintigraphy  nuclear medicine   angiography or magnetic resonance imaging  MRI    In certain circumstances  less invasive testing may not provide a certain diagnosis  Where definitive diagnosis is required  a biopsy of the kidney  renal biopsy  may be performed  This typically involves the insertion  under local anaesthetic and ultrasound or CT guidance  of a core biopsy needle into the kidney to obtain a small sample of kidney tissue  The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope  allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney  Additionally  the pathology may also stage a problem affecting the kidney  allowing some degree of prognostication  In some circumstances  kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early relapse   4  Treatment  Treatments in nephrology can include medications  blood products  surgical interventions  urology  vascular or surgical procedures   renal replacement therapy  dialysis or kidney transplantation  and plasma exchange  Kidney problems can have significant impact on quality and length of life  and so psychological support  health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology   Chronic kidney disease is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions  such as diabetes   avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys  nephrotoxins like radiologic contrast and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs   antihypertensives  diet and weight modification and planning for end stage renal failure  Impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body  An erythropoetin stimulating agent may be required to ensure adequate production of red blood cells  activated vitamin D supplements and phosphate binders may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on bone metabolism  and blood volume and electrolyte disturbance may need correction   Auto immune and inflammatory kidney disease  such as vasculitis or transplant rejection  may be treated with immunosuppression  Commonly used agents are prednisone  mycophenolate  cyclophosphamide  cyclosporine  tacrolimus  everolimus  thymoglobulin and sirolimus  Newer  so called  biologic drugs  or monoclonal antibodies  are also used in these conditions and include rituximab  basiliximab and eculizumab  Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and a process known as plasma exchange can also be employed   When the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body  end stage renal failure is said to have occurred  Without renal replacement therapy  death from renal failure will eventually result  Dialysis is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life  Renal transplantation replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an organ donor and inducing immunologic tolerance of that organ with immunosuppression  At present  renal transplantation is the most effective treatment for end stage renal failure although its world wide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs   Most kidney conditions are chronic conditions and so long term followup with a nephrologist is usually necessary   5  Organizations  The International Society of Nephrology is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwide  In the USA  the National Kidney Foundation is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases  Founded in 1966  the American
