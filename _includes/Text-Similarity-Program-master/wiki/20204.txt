Manatees  family Trichechidae  genus Trichechus  are large  fully aquatic  mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows  There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae  representing three of the four living species in the order Sirenia  the Amazonian manatee  Trichechus inunguis   the West Indian manatee  Trichechus manatus   and the West African manatee  Trichechus senegalensis   They measure up to long  weigh as much as   and have paddle like flippers  The name manatí comes from the Taíno  a pre Columbian people of the Caribbean  meaning  breast    1  Taxonomy  Manatees comprise three of the four living species in the order Sirenia  The fourth is the Eastern Hemisphere s dugong  The Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four legged land mammals over 60 million years ago  with the closest living relatives being the Proboscidea  elephants  and Hyracoidea  hyraxes    The Amazonian s hair color is brownish gray  and they have thick wrinkled skin often with coarse hair  or  whiskers   Photos are rare  although very little is known about this species  scientists think they are similar to West Indian manatees   2  Description  Manatees have a mass of   and mean length of   with maxima of and seen  the females tend to be larger and heavier   When born  baby manatees have an average mass of   They have a large  flexible  prehensile upper lip  They use the lip to gather food and eat  as well as using it for social interactions and communications  Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians  the dugongs  Their small  widely spaced eyes have eyelids that close in a circular manner  The adults have no incisor or canine teeth  just a set of cheek teeth  which are not clearly differentiated into molars and premolars  These teeth are continuously replaced throughout life  with new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther forward in the mouth  This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst the other mammals  only occurs in the kangaroo and elephant  At any given time  a manatee typically has no more than six teeth in each jaw of its mouth  Its tail is paddle shaped  and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and dugongs  a dugong tail is fluked  similar in shape to a that of a whale  Females have two teats  one under each flipper  a characteristic that was used to make early links between the manatee and elephants   Manatees are unusual amongst mammals in possessing just six cervical vertebrae  which may be due to mutations in the homeotic genes  All other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae  other than the two toed and three toed sloths   Like horses  they have a simple stomach  but a large cecum  in which they can digest tough plant matter  In general  their intestines have a typical length of about 45 meters  which is unusually long for animals of their size  Manatees produce enormous amounts of gas  which contributes to their barrel shape  to aid in the digestion of their food   Manatees are the only animal known to have a vascularized cornea   3  Behavior  Apart from mothers with their young  or males following a receptive female  manatees are generally solitary animals  Manatees spend approximately 50% of the day sleeping submerged  surfacing for air regularly at intervals of less than 20 minutes  The remainder of the time is mostly spent grazing in shallow waters at depths of   The Florida subspecies  T  m  latirostris  has been known to live up to 60 years   3 1  Locomotion  Generally  manatees swim at about   However  they have been known to swim at up to in short bursts   3 2  Intelligence and learning  Manatees are capable of understanding discrimination tasks and show signs of complex associative learning  They also have good long term memory  They demonstrate discrimination and task learning abilities similar to dolphins and pinnipeds in acoustic and visual studies   3 3  Reproduction  Manatees typically breed once every two years  generally only a single calf is born  Gestation lasts about 12 months and a further 12 to 18 months to wean the calf   3 4  Communication  Manatees emit a wide range of sounds used in communication  especially between cows and their calves  Adults communicate to maintain contact and during sexual and play behaviors  Taste and smell  in addition to sight  sound  and touch  may also be forms of communication   3 5  Diet  Manatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater   e g  floating hyacinth  pickerel weed  alligator weed  water lettuce  hydrilla  water celery  musk grass  mangrove leaves  and saltwater plants  e g  sea grasses  shoal grass  manatee grass  turtle grass  widgeon grass  sea clover  and marine algae   Using their divided upper lip  an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10% 15% of their body weight  about 50 kg  per day  Consuming such an amount requires the manatee to graze for up to seven hours a day  Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets   3 6  Feeding behavior  Manatees use their flippers to  walk  along the bottom whilst they dig for plants and roots in the substrate  When plants are detected  the flippers are used to scoop the vegetation toward the manatee s lips  The manatee has prehensile lips  the upper lip pad is split into left and right sides which can move independently  The lips use seven muscles to manipulate and tear at plants  Manatees use their lips and front flippers to move the plants into the mouth  The manatee does not have front teeth  however  behind the lips  on the roof of the mouth  there are dense  ridged pads  These horny ridges  and the manatee s lower jaw  tear through ingested plant material   3 7  Dentition  Manatees have four rows of teeth  There are 6 to 8 high crowned  open rooted molars located along each side of the upper and lower jaw giving a total of 24 to 32 flat  rough textured teeth  Eating gritty vegetation abrades the teeth  particularly the enamel crown  however  research indicates that the enamel structure in manatee molars is weak  To compensate for this  manatee teeth are continually replaced  When anterior molars wear down  they are shed  Posterior molars erupt at the back of the row and slowly move forward to replace these like enamel crowns on a conveyor belt  This process continues throughout the manatee s lifetime  The rate at which the teeth migrate forward depends on how quickly the anterior teeth abrade  Some studies indicate that the rate is about 1 cm month although other studies indicate 0 1 cm month  This process of teeth being continually replaced is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals  only occurs in elephants and kangaroos   4  Ecology  4 1  Range and habitat  Manatees inhabit the shallow  marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico  T  manatus  West Indian manatee   the Amazon Basin  T  inunguis  Amazonian manatee   and West Africa  T  senegalensis  West African manatee    West Indian manatees prefer warmer temperatures and are known to congregate in shallow waters  They frequently migrate through brackish water estuaries to freshwater springs  They cannot survive below 15 °C  60 °F   Their natural source for warmth during winter is warm  spring fed rivers   4 1 1  West Indian  The coast of the state of Georgia is usually the northernmost range of the West Indian manatees because their low metabolic rate does not protect them in cold water  Prolonged exposure to water temperatures below 68 °F  20 °C  can bring about  cold stress syndrome  and death   Florida manatees can move freely between salinity extremes   Manatees have been seen as far north as Cape Cod  and in 2006  one was seen in New York City and Rhode Island s Narragansett Bay  as cited in The Boston Globe  According to Memphis  Tennessee s The Commercial Appeal newspaper  one manatee was spotted in the Wolf River harbor near the Mississippi River in downtown Memphis on October 23  2006  though it was later found dead 10 miles downriver in McKellar Lake   The West Indian manatee migrates into Florida rivers  such as the Crystal  the Homosassa  and the Chassahowitzka Rivers  The headsprings of these rivers maintain a 22 °C  72 °F  temperature all year  During November to March  about 400 West Indian manatees  according to the National Wildlife Refuge  congregate in the rivers in Citrus County  Florida   During winter  manatees often congregate near the warm water outflows of power plants along the coast of Florida instead of migrating south as they once did  Some conservations are concerned these manatees have become too reliant on these artificially warmed areas  The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to find a new way to heat the water for manatees that are dependent on plants that have closed  The main water treatment plant in Guyana has four manatees that keep storage canals clear of weeds  there are also some in the ponds of the National Park in Georgetown  Guyana   Studies suggest Florida manatees must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of water and salts within their bodies   Accurate population estimates of the Florida manatee  T  manatus  are difficult  They have been called scientifically weak due to widely varying counts from year to year  some areas showing increases  others decreases and little strong evidence of increases except in two areas  Manatee counts are highly variable without an accurate way to estimate numbers  In Florida in 1996  a winter survey found 2 639 manatees  in 1997  a January survey found 2 229  and a February survey found 1 706  A statewide synoptic survey in January 2010 found 5 067 manatees living in Florida  which was a new record count   Population viability studies conducted in 1997 found that decreasing adult survival and eventual extinction is a probable future outcome for Florida manatees  without additional protection   Fossil remains of Florida manatee ancestors date back about 45 million years   4 1 2  Amazonian  The freshwater Amazonian manatee  T  inunguis  inhabits the Amazon River and its tributaries  and never ventures into salt water   4 1 3  West African  They are found in coastal marine and estuarine habitats  and in freshwater river systems along the west coast of Africa from the Senegal River south to the Kwanza River in Angola  They live as far upriver on the Niger River as Gao  Mali   4 2  Predation  Overall  predation does not present a significant threat to the survival of any manatee species   5  Relation to humans  5 1  Threats  The main causes of death for manatees are human related issues  such as habitat destruction and human objects  Natural causes of death include adverse temperatures and disease   5 1 1  Ship strikes  Their slow moving  curious nature  coupled with dense coastal development  has led to many violent collisions with propeller driven boats and ships  leading frequently to maiming  disfigurement  and even death  As a result  a large proportion of manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs  usually caused by larger vessels that do not have skegs in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard outboard recreational boats have  They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns  Many manatees have been cut in half by large vessels like ships and tug boats  even in the highly populated lower St  Johns River s narrow channels  Some are concerned that the current situation is inhumane  with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee  Often  the cuts lead to infections  which can prove fatal  Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal  Recent testing shows that manatees may be able to hear speed boats and other watercraft approaching  due to the frequency the boat makes  However  a manatee may not be able to hear the approaching boats when they are performing day to day activities or distractions  The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 kilohertz to 32 kilohertz   Manatees hear on a higher frequency than would be expected for such large marine mammals  Many large boats emit very low frequencies  which confuse the manatee and explain their lack of awareness around boats  The Lloyd s mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface  where most accidents occur  Research indicates that when a boat has a higher frequency the manatees rapidly swim away from danger   In 2003  a population model was released by the United States Geological Survey that predicted an extremely grave situation confronting the manatee in both the Southwest and Atlantic regions where the vast majority of manatees are found  It states   According to marine mammal veterinarians   These veterinarians go on to state   In 2009  of the 429 Florida manatees recorded dead  97 were killed by commercial and recreational vessels  which broke the earlier record number of 95 set in 2002   5 1 2  Red tide  Another cause of manatee deaths is the red tide  a term used for the proliferation  or  blooms   of the microscopic marine algae of the species Karenia brevis  a member of the dinoflagellates that produces brevetoxins that can have toxic effects on the central nervous systems of creatures in the area of the algae bloom   In 1996  a red tide was responsible for 151 manatee deaths  The epidemic began on March 5 and continued through April 28  wiping out approximately 15% of the known population of manatees along South Florida s western coast  In 1982  another outbreak resulted in 37 deaths  and in 2005  44 more deaths were attributed to the blooms   5 1 3  Additional threats  Manatees occasionally ingest fishing gear  hooks  metal weights  etc   while feeding  These foreign materials do not appear to harm manatees  except for monofilament line or string  which can clog a manatee s digestive system and slowly kill it   Manatees can also be crushed in water control structures  navigation locks  floodgates  etc    drown in pipes and culverts  and are occasionally killed by entanglement in fishing gear  primarily crab pot float lines   While humans are allowed to swim with manatees in one area of Florida  there have been numerous charges of people harassing and disturbing the manatees   The African manatee s only significant threats are due to poaching  habitat loss  and other environmental impacts  They occasionally get stranded as the river dries up at the end of rainy season   5 2  Conservation  All three species of manatee are listed by the World Conservation Union as vulnerable to extinction   It is illegal under federal and Florida law to injure or harm a manatee  They are classified as  endangered  by both the state and the federal governments   The MV Freedom Star and MV Liberty Star  ships used by NASA to tow space shuttle solid rocket boosters back to Kennedy Space Center  are propelled only by water jets to protect the endangered manatee population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships are based   Brazil outlawed hunting in 1973 in an effort to preserve the species  Deaths by boat strikes are still common   5 3  Hunting  Manatees were traditionally hunted by indigenous Caribbean people  When Christopher Columbus arrived in the region  hunting was already an established trade  although this is less common today   The primary hunting method was for the hunter to approach in a dugout canoe  offering bait to attract it close enough to temporarily stun it with a blow near the head from an oar like pole  Many times the creature would flip over  leaving it vulnerable to further attacks   From manatee hides  Native Americans made war shields  canoes  and shoes  though manatees were predominantly hunted for their abundant meat   Later  manatees were hunted for their bones  which were used to make  special potions   Until the 1800s  museums paid as much as $100 for bones or hides  Though hunting was banned in 1893  poaching continues today   5 4  Captivity  The oldest manatee in captivity is Snooty  at the South Florida Museum s Parker Manatee Aquarium in Bradenton  Florida  Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21  1948  age 65   Snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births  Raised entirely in captivity  Snooty will never be released into the wild  So he is the only manatee at the Aquarium  and one of a select few captive manatees in the United States  that is allowed to interact with human handlers  This makes him uniquely suitable to manatee research and education   Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos  such as the Tierpark in Berlin  the Nuremberg Zoo  in ZooParc de Beauval in France and in the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy  The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them  They are also included in the plans for a new National Wildlife Conservation Park in Bristol  England  whose first exhibit is due to open in summer 2013 with the manatees as an addition as early as 2015   5 5  Culture  The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids  Native Americans ground the bones to treat asthma and earache  In West African folklore  they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human  Killing one was taboo and required penance   6  Notes  7  External links
