Ray Douglas Bradbury  August 22  1920June 5  2012  was an American fantasy  science fiction  horror and mystery fiction author  Best known for his dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451  1953  and for the science fiction and horror stories gathered together as The Martian Chronicles  1950  and The Illustrated Man  1951   Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th century American writers  He wrote and consulted on many screenplays and television scripts  including Moby Dick and most notably  It Came from Outer Space  and many of his works have been adapted into comic books  television shows  and films   1  Early life  Bradbury was born on August 22  1920 in Waukegan  Illinois  to Esther  née Moberg  Bradbury  a Swedish immigrant  and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury  a power and telephone lineman of English descent  He was given the middle name  Douglas   after the actor Douglas Fairbanks   1 1  Hometown  Ray Bradbury was surrounded by a loving extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan  Illinois  This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories  In Bradbury s works of fiction  1920s Waukegan becomes  Green Town   Illinois  In his stories  Green Town is a symbol of safety and home  which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace  It serves as the setting of his modern classics Dandelion Wine  Something Wicked This Way Comes  and Farewell Summer  In Green Town  Bradbury s favorite uncle sprouts wings  traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers  and his grandparents provide room and board to Charles Dickens  Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown  in Summer Morning  Summer Night  a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town  Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small town world of the American heartland  which was the foundation of his roots   Between 1926 and 1933  the Bradbury family moved back and forth between Waukegan and Tucson  Arizona  In 1931  at the age of eleven  young Ray began writing his own stories  The country was going through the Great Depression  and sometimes Bradbury wrote on butcher paper   The Bradbury family moved to Los Angeles  California  in 1934   Bradbury was related to the American Shakespeare scholar Douglas Spaulding  He was also descended from Mary Bradbury  who was tried at one of the Salem witch trials in 1692   2  Influences  process and background  2 1  Hollywood  The Bradbury family lived in Tucson  Arizona  in 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 as the father pursued employment  each time returning to Waukegan  but eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934  when Bradbury was 14  The family arrived with only 40 dollars  which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week  This meant they could stay and Bradbury  who was in love with Hollywood  was ecstatic   The family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles  the flagship theater for MGM and Fox  There  Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week  He roller skated there as well as all over town  as he put it  hell bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars  It was glorious   Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were Norma Shearer  Laurel and Hardy  and Ronald Colman  Sometimes he would spend all day in front of Paramount Pictures or Columbia Pictures and then skate to the Brown Derby to watch the stars who came and went for meals  He recounted seeing Cary Grant  Marlene Dietrich and Mae West  who he would learn made a regular appearance every Friday night  bodyguard in tow   2 2  Literature  Bradbury was a reader and writer throughout his youth  He knew as a young boy that he was  going into one of the arts    In 1932  one of Bradbury s earliest influences was Edgar Allan Poe  At age twelve  Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about eighteen  At the time  his favorites were also Edgar Rice Burroughs and Burroughs  John Carter of Mars series  as well as comic books  He listened to the radio show Chandu the Magician  and when the show went off the air every night he would sit and write the entire script from memory   In his youth  he spent much time in the Carnegie library in Waukegan  reading such authors as H  G  Wells  Jules Verne  and Edgar Rice Burroughs  creator of Tarzan of the Apes  He loved Burroughs  The Warlord of Mars so much that at the age of 12 he wrote his own sequel  The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate  He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels   When he was seventeen  Bradbury read stories published in Astounding Science Fiction  and said he read everything by Robert A  Heinlein  Arthur C  Clarke  and the early writings of Theodore Sturgeon and A  E  van Vogt  but cited H  G  Wells and Jules Verne as his big science fiction influences  Bradbury identified with Verne  saying   He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world  and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally    Bradbury admitted he stopped reading genre books in his twenties and embraced a broad field of literature that included Alexander Pope and poet John Donne   An aunt read him short stories when he was a child  He used this library as a setting for much of his novel Something Wicked This Way Comes  and depicted Waukegan as  Green Town  in some of his other semi autobiographical novels – Dandelion Wine and Farewell Summer – as well as in many of his short stories   He attributed to two incidents his lifelong habit of writing every day  The first of these  occurring when he was three years old  was his mother s taking him to see Lon Chaney s performance in The Hunchback of Notre Dame  The second incident occurred in 1932  when a carnival entertainer  one Mr  Electrico  touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword  made his hair stand on end  and shouted   Live forever   Bradbury remarked   I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr  Electrico    he  gave me a future   I began to write  full time  I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago   It was at that age that Bradbury first started to do magic  which was his first great love  If he had not discovered writing  he would have become a magician   Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences  and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers Robert Frost  William Shakespeare  John Steinbeck  Aldous Huxley  and Thomas Wolfe  From Steinbeck  he said he learned  how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment   He studied Eudora Welty for her  remarkable ability to give you atmosphere  character  and motion in a single line   Bradbury s favorite writers growing up included Katherine Anne Porter  who wrote about the American South  Edith Wharton  and Jessamyn West  He often said he was a fantasy writer  not a science fiction writer  and numerous times is quoted stating  The only science fiction I ve written is Fahrenheit 451   elucidating  science fiction is the art of the possible   Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer  the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death  When he was a boy  he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back  Years later  as he wrote about it  tears flowed from him  He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer   When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose  Bradbury replied   From reading so much poetry every day of my life  My favorite writers have been those who’ve said things well   He is quoted   If you re reluctant to weep  you won t live a full and complete life    In high school  Ray Bradbury was active in both the Poetry Club and the Drama club  continuing plans to become an actor but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed  Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School  where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh  and short story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson  The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing  but he did not attend college  Instead  he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard  In regard to his education  Bradbury said   He told The Paris Review   You can t learn to write in college  It s a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don’t    It was in UCLA s Powell Library  in a study room with typewriters for rent  that Bradbury wrote his classic story of a book burning future  The Fireman  which was about 25 000 words long  It was later published at about 50 000 words under the name Fahrenheit 451  for a total cost of $9 80  due to the library s typewriter rental fees of ten cents per half hour   3  Career  When the Bradbury family moved to Los Angeles  California in 1934  Bradbury attended Los Angeles High School and was active in the drama club  Bradbury often roller skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities  Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met this way were special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen and radio star George Burns  Bradbury s first pay as a writer was at the age of fourteen  when Burns hired him to write for the Burns and Allen show   In 1936  at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood  Ray Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society  Thrilled to find there were others with his interests  at the age of sixteen Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday night conclave   Bradbury began submitting his short stories for publication  After a rejection notice from the pulp magazine Weird Tales  Bradbury submitted to magazines  At Mademoiselle magazine  a young editorial assistant named Truman Capote spotted one of Bradbury s short stories   Homecoming    Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile  which led to it getting published in the magazine  Homecoming won a place in The O  Henry Prize Stories of 1947   Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein  then 31 years old  Bradbury recalled   He was well known  and he wrote humanistic science fiction  which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical    His first published story was  Hollerbochen s Dilemma   which appeared in the January 1938 number of Forrest J  Ackerman s fanzine Imagination   In July 1939  Ackerman gave nineteen year old Ray Bradbury the money to head to New York for the First World Science Fiction Convention in New York City  and funded Ray Bradbury s fanzine  titled Futuria Fantasia  Bradbury wrote most of its four issues  each limited to under 100 copies  Between 1940 and 1947  he was a contributor to Rob Wagner s film magazine  Script   Ray Bradbury was free to start a career in writing when  owing to his bad eyesight  he was rejected admission into the military during World War II  Having been inspired by science fiction heroes like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers  Bradbury began to publish science fiction stories in fanzines in 1938  Bradbury was invited by Forrest J  Ackerman to attend the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society  which at the time met at Clifton s Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles  This was where he met the writers Robert A  Heinlein  Emil Petaja  Fredric Brown  Henry Kuttner  Leigh Brackett  and Jack Williamson   In 1939  Bradbury joined Laraine Day s Wilshire Players Guild where for two years he wrote and acted in several plays  They were  as Bradbury later described   so incredibly bad  that he gave up playwriting for two decades  Bradbury s first paid piece   Pendulum   written with Henry Hasse  was published in the pulp magazine Super Science Stories in November 1941  for which he earned $15   Bradbury sold his first story   The Lake   for $13 75 at the age of twenty two  He became a full time writer by the end of 1942  His first collection of short stories  Dark Carnival  was published in 1947 by Arkham House  a small press in Sauk City  Wisconsin  owned by writer August Derleth  Reviewing Dark Carnival for the New York Herald Tribune  Will Cuppy proclaimed Bradbury  suitable for general consumption  and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author John Collier   A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer Christopher Isherwood gave Bradbury the opportunity to put The Martian Chronicles into the hands of a respected critic  Isherwood s glowing review followed   Bradbury relates the following meeting with Sergei Bondarchuk  director of Soviet epic film series War and Peace  at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk s honor   They formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people   Bradbury was once described as a  Midwest surrealist  and is often labeled a science fiction writer  Bradbury resisted that categorization  however   On another occasion  Bradbury observed that the novel touches on the alienation of people by media   Besides his fiction work  Bradbury wrote many short essays on the arts and culture  attracting the attention of critics in this field  Bradbury also hosted  The Ray Bradbury Theater  which was based on his short stories  Bradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the 1964 New York World s Fair and the original exhibit housed in Epcot s Spaceship Earth geosphere at Walt Disney World  In the 1980s  Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction   Several comic book writers have adapted Bradbury s stories  Particularly noted among these were EC Comics  line of horror and science fiction comics  Initially  the writers plagiarized his stories  but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work  The comics featuring Bradbury s stories included Tales from the Crypt  Weird Science  Weird Fantasy  Crime Suspenstories  Haunt of Fear and others   Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life  leaving a rich theatrical legacy as well as literary  Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena   Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s  60s era  Jason V Brock s   which details his troubles with Rod Serling  and his friendships with writers Charles Beaumont  George Clayton Johnson  and most especially his dear friend William F  Nolan  as well as Brock s   which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent  close friend  mega fan  and Famous Monsters of Filmland editor Forrest J Ackerman   On May 24  1956  Ray Bradbury appeared on the popular quiz show  You Bet Your Life starring Groucho Marx  Season 6 Episode 35    4  Personal life  Ray Bradbury was married to Marguerite McClure  January 16  1922 – November 24  2003  from 1947 until her death  they had four daughters  Susan  Ramona  Bettina and Alexandra  Though he lived in Los Angeles  Bradbury never obtained a driver s license but relied on public transportation or his bicycle  He lived at home until he was twenty seven and married  His wife of fifty six years  Maggie  as she was affectionately called  was the only woman Bradbury ever dated   Bradbury was a close friend of Charles Addams  and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury s stories about the Elliotts  a family that would resemble Addams  own Addams Family placed in rural Illinois  Bradbury s first story about them was  Homecoming   published in the 1946 Halloween issue of Mademoiselle  with Addams illustrations  He and Addams planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family s complete history  but it never materialized  and according to a 2001 interview  they went their separate ways  In October 2001  Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative  From the Dust Returned  featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original  Homecoming  illustration   Another close friend was animator Ray Harryhausen  who was best man at Bradbury s wedding  During a BAFTA 2010 awards tribute in honor of Ray Harryhausen s 90th birthday  Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman s house when they were both 18 years old  Their shared love for science fiction  King Kong  and the King Vidor directed film The Fountainhead  written by Ayn Rand  was the beginning of a lifelong friendship  These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices  Since their first meeting  they kept in touch at least once a month  spanning over 70 years of friendship   In later years  Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the  devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends   Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry  who was an intimate friend for many years  They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for Star Trek  which Bradbury never did  stating he  never had the ability to adapt other people s ideas into any sensible form    Bradbury suffered a stroke in 1999 that left him partially dependent on a wheelchair for mobility  Despite this he continued to write  and had even written an essay on his inspiration for writing for The New Yorker published only a week prior to his death  Bradbury made regular appearances at science fiction conventions until 2009  when he retired from the circuit   Bradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems  and helped to raise money to prevent the closure of several in California due to budgetary cuts  He iterated from his past that  libraries raised me   and shunned colleges and universities  comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students  His opinion varied on modern technology  In 1985 Bradbury wrote   I see nothing but good coming from computers  When they first appeared on the scene  people were saying   Oh my God  I m so afraid   I hate people like that – I call them the neo Luddites   and  In a sense  computers  are simply books  Books are all over the place  and computers will be too   He resisted the conversion of his work into e books  stating in 2010  We have too many cellphones  We ve got too many internets  We have got to get rid of those machines  We have too many machines now   When the publishing rights for Fahrenheit 451 came up for renewal in December 2011  Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher  Simon & Schuster  allowed the e book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron  The title remains the only book in the Simon & Schuster catalog where this is possible  Bradbury chose a burial place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles with a headstone that reads  Author of Fahrenheit 451    5  Death  Bradbury died in Los Angeles  California  on June 5  2012  at the age of 91  after a lengthy illness   The New York Times obituary stated that Bradbury was  the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream   The Los Angeles Times credited Bradbury with the ability  to write lyrically and evocatively of lands an imagination away  worlds he anchored in the here and now with a sense of visual clarity and small town familiarity   Bradbury s grandson  Danny Karapetian  stated that Bradbury s works had  influenced so many artists  writers  teachers  scientists  and it s always really touching and comforting to hear their stories   The Washington Post hallmarked several modern day technologies that Bradbury had envisioned much earlier in his writing  such as the idea of banking ATMs and earbuds and Bluetooth headsets from Fahrenheit 451  and the concepts of artificial intelligence within I Sing the Body Electric   On June 6  2012  in an official public statement from the White House Press Office  President Barack Obama said   Bradbury s personal library was willed to the Waukegan Public Library  where he had many of his formative reading experiences   Several celebrity fans of Bradbury paid tribute to the author by stating the influence of his works on their own careers and creations  Filmmaker Steven Spielberg stated that Bradbury was   his  muse for the better part of  his  sci fi career     On the world of science fiction and fantasy and imagination he is immortal   Writer Neil Gaiman felt that  the landscape of the world we live in would have been diminished if we had not had him in our world   Author Stephen King released a statement on his website saying   Ray Bradbury wrote three great novels and three hundred great stories  One of the latter was called  A Sound of Thunder   The sound I hear today is the thunder of a giant s footsteps fading away  But the novels and stories remain  in all their resonance and strange beauty   Bradbury s influence well exceeded the field of literature  Progressive house music producer and performer  Joel Thomas Zimmerman  who is most commonly known by his stage name Deadmau5  composed a song named after one of Bradbury s short stories  The Veldt  which was originally published in the Saturday Evening Post  The EP of  The Veldt  was released days after Bradbury s death and is dedicated to the memory of the author   6  Bibliography  Bradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories  More than eight million copies of his works  published in over 36 languages  have been sold around the world   6 1  First novel  In 1949  Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child  He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for fifty cents a night  He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them  Just before getting ready to go home  Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday  When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he didn t have one  the editor  coincidentally named Walter Bradbury  asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book length collection  The title was the editor s idea  he suggested   You could call it  The Martian Chronicles   Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars  That evening  he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline  He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning  who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for ten thousand dollars  When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles  he connected all the short stories and that became The Martian Chronicles   6 2  Intended first novel  What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes  Summer Morning  Summer Night  started out to be Ray Bradbury s first true novel  The core of the work was Bradbury s witnessing of the American small town and life in the American heartland   In the winter of 1955–56  after a consultation with his Doubleday editor  Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town  the pseudonym for his hometown  Instead  he extracted seventeen stories and  with three other Green Town tales  bridged them into his 1957 book Dandelion Wine  Later  in 2006  Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction  and retitled it Farewell Summer  These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one   The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories  scenes and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel
