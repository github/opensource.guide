John Keats    31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821  was an English Romantic poet  He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death   Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his life  his reputation grew after his death  so that by the end of the 19th century  he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets  He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers  Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats was the most significant literary experience of his life   The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery most notably in the series of odes  Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature   1  Biography  1 1  Early life  John Keats was born in Moorgate  London  on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife  born Frances Jennings  There is no clear evidence of his exact birthplace  Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October  baptism records give the date as the 31st  He was the eldest of four surviving children  his younger siblings were George  1797–1841   Thomas  1799–1818   and Frances Mary  Fanny   1803–1889  who eventually married Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez  Another son was lost in infancy  His father first worked as a hostler at the stables attached to the Swan and Hoop inn  an establishment he later managed and where the growing family lived for some years  Keats believed that he was born at the inn  a birthplace of humble origins  but there is no evidence to support his belief  The Globe pub now occupies the site  2012   a few yards from the modern day Moorgate station  He was baptised at St Botolph without Bishopsgate  and sent to a local dame school as a child   His parents were unable to afford Eton or Harrow  so in the summer of 1803  he was sent to board at John Clarke s school in Enfield  close to his grandparents  house  The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger  more prestigious schools  In the family atmosphere at Clarke s  Keats developed an interest in classics and history  which would stay with him throughout his short life  The headmaster s son  Charles Cowden Clarke  also became an important mentor and friend  introducing Keats to Renaissance literature  including Tasso  Spenser  and Chapman s translations  The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character   always in extremes   given to indolence and fighting  However  at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study  winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809   In April 1804  when Keats was eight  his father died  The cause of death was a skull fracture  suffered when he fell from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school  Thomas Keats died intestate  Frances remarried two months later  but left her new husband soon afterwards  and the four children went to live with their grandmother  Alice Jennings  in the village of Edmonton  In March 1810 when Keats was 14  his mother died of tuberculosis  leaving the children in the custody of their grandmother  She appointed two guardians  Richard Abbey and John Sandell to take care of them  That autumn  Keats left Clarke s school  to apprentice with Thomas Hammond  a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family  Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813  Cowden Clarke  who remained a close friend of Keats  described this period as  the most placid time in Keats s life    1 2  Early career  From 1814 Keats had two bequests  held in trust for him until his 21st birthday  £800 willed by his grandfather John Jennings  about £34 000 in today s money  and a portion of his mother s legacy  £8000  about £340 000 today   to be equally divided between her living children  It seems he was not told of either  since he never applied for any of the money  Historically  blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian  but he may also have been unaware  William Walton  solicitor for Keats s mother and grandmother  definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats  It seems he did not  The money would have made a critical difference to the poet s expectations  Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him  as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently   Having finished his apprenticeship with Hammond  Keats registered as a medical student at Guy s Hospital  now part of King s College London  and began studying there in October 1815  Within a month of starting  he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital  assisting surgeons during operations  the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today  It was a significant promotion that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine  it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload  Keats s long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy s Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine  assuring financial security  and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor  He lodged near the hospital at 28 St Thomas s Street in Southwark  with other medical students  including Henry Stephens who became a famous inventor and ink magnate   However  Keats s training took up increasing amounts of his writing time  and he was increasingly ambivalent about his medical career  He felt that he faced a stark choice  He had written his first extant poem   An Imitation of Spenser   in 1814  when he was 19  Now  strongly drawn by ambition  inspired by fellow poets such as Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron  and beleaguered by family financial crises  he suffered periods of depression  His brother George wrote that John  feared that he should never be a poet  & if he was not he would destroy himself   In 1816  Keats received his apothecary s licence  which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary  physician  and surgeon  but before the end of the year he announced to his guardian that he was resolved to be a poet  not a surgeon   Although he continued his work and training at Guy s  Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature  experimenting with verse forms  particularly the sonnet  In May 1816  Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet  O Solitude  in his magazine The Examiner  a leading liberal magazine of the day  It was the first appearance in print of Keats s poetry  and Charles Cowden Clarke described it as his friend s red letter day  the first proof that Keats s ambitions were valid  In the summer of the same year Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write  There he began  Calidore  and initiated the era of his great letter writing  On his return to London he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street  Southwark  and braced himself for further study in order to become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons   In October  Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt  a close friend of Byron and Shelley  Five months later came the publication of Poems  the first volume of Keats s verse  which included  I stood tiptoe  and  Sleep and Poetry   both strongly influenced by Hunt  The book was a critical failure  arousing little interest  although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion  Clarke commented that the book  might have emerged in Timbuctoo   Keats s publishers  Charles and James Ollier  felt ashamed of the book  Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey on Fleet Street  Unlike the Olliers  Keats s new publishers were enthusiastic about his work  Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance  Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company s rooms available for young writers to meet  Their publishing lists eventually included Coleridge  Hazlitt  Clare  Hogg  Carlyle and Lamb   Through Taylor and Hessey  Keats met their Eton educated lawyer  Richard Woodhouse  who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by Poems  Although he noted that Keats could be  wayward  trembling  easily daunted   Woodhouse was convinced of Keats s genius  a poet to support as he became one of England s greatest writers  Soon after they met  the two became close friends  and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana  documenting as much as he could about Keats s poetry  This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats s work  Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keats  Johnson  ceaselessly promoting the writer s work  fighting his corner  and spurring his poetry to greater heights  In later years  Woodhouse was one of the few people to accompany Keats to Gravesend to embark on his final trip to Rome   In spite of the bad reviews of Poems  Hunt published the essay  Three Young Poets   Shelley  Keats  and Reynolds  and the sonnet  On First Looking into Chapman s Homer   foreseeing great things to come  He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle  including the editor of The Times  Thomas Barnes  the writer Charles Lamb  the conductor Vincent Novello  and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds  who would become a close friend  He was also regularly meeting William Hazlitt  a powerful literary figure of the day  It was a decisive turning point for Keats  establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed  a new school of poetry   At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey   I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart s affections and the truth of the imagination  What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth   This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of  Ode on a Grecian Urn   Beauty is truth  truth beauty  – that is all   Ye know on earth  and all ye need to know   In early December  under the heady influence of his artistic friends  Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry  to Abbey s fury  Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and  despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness  had made large loans to friends such as painter Benjamin Haydon  Keats would go on to lend £700 to his brother George  By lending so much  Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts   Having left his training at the hospital  suffering from a succession of colds  and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London  Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of Hampstead in April 1817  Both John and George nursed their brother Tom  who was suffering from tuberculosis  The house was close to Hunt and others from his circle in Hampstead  as well as to Coleridge  respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets  at that time living in Highgate  On 11 April 1818  Keats and Coleridge had a long walk together on Hampstead Heath  In a letter to his brother George  Keats wrote that they talked about  a thousand things     nightingales  poetry  poetical sensation  metaphysics   Around this time he was introduced to Charles Wentworth Dilke and James Rice   In June 1818  Keats began a walking tour of Scotland  Ireland  and the Lake District with his friend Charles Armitage Brown  Keats  brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them as far as Lancaster and then continued to Liverpool  from where the couple emigrated to America  They lived in Ohio and Louisville  Kentucky  until 1841  when George s investments failed  Like Keats  other brother  they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis  for which there was no effective treatment until the next century  In July  while on the Isle of Mull  Keats caught a bad cold and  was too thin and fevered to proceed on the journey   After his return south in August  Keats continued to nurse Tom  exposing himself to infection  Some biographers suggest that this is when tuberculosis  his  family disease   first took hold   Consumption  was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820  and there was considerable stigma attached to the condition  as it was often associated with weakness  repressed sexual passion  or masturbation  Keats  refuses to give it a name  in his letters  Tom Keats died on 1 December 1818   1 3  Wentworth Place  John Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place  owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown  It was also on the edge of Hampstead Heath  ten minutes  walk south of his old home in Well Walk  The winter of 1818–19  though a difficult period for the poet  marked the beginning of his annus mirabilis in which he wrote his most mature work  He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met Wordsworth  Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means  but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends   He composed five of his six great odes at Wentworth Place in April and May and  although it is debated in which order they were written   Ode to Psyche  opened the published series  According to Brown   Ode to a Nightingale  was composed under a plum tree in the garden  Brown wrote   In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house  Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song  and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass plot under a plum tree  where he sat for two or three hours  When he came into the house  I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand  and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books  On inquiry  I found those scraps  four or five in number  contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale   Dilke  co owner of the house  strenuously denied the story  printed in Richard Monckton Milnes  1848 biography of Keats  dismissing it as  pure delusion     Ode on a Grecian Urn  and  Ode on Melancholy  were inspired by sonnet forms and probably written after  Ode to a Nightingale   Keats s new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued Endymion  which Keats dedicated to Thomas Chatterton  a work that he termed  a trial of my Powers of Imagination   It was damned by the critics  giving rise to Byron s quip that Keats was ultimately  snuffed out by an article   suggesting that he never truly got over it  A particularly harsh review by John Wilson Croker appeared in the April 1818 edition of The Quarterly Review  John Gibson Lockhart writing in Blackwood s Magazine  described Endymion as  imperturbable drivelling idiocy   With biting sarcasm  Lockhart advised   It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet  so back to the shop Mr John  back to plasters  pills  and ointment boxes   It was Lockhart at Blackwoods who coined the defamatory term  the Cockney School  for Hunt and his circle  which included both Hazlitt and Keats  The dismissal was as much political as literary  aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education  non formal rhyming and  low diction   They had not attended Eton  Harrow or Oxbridge and they were not from the upper classes   In 1819  Keats wrote  The Eve of St  Agnes    La Belle Dame sans Merci    Hyperion    Lamia  and a play  Otho the Great  critically damned and not performed until 1950   The poems  Fancy  and  Bards of passion and of mirth  were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place  In September  very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ship s surgeon  he approached his publishers with a new book of poems  They were unimpressed with the collection  finding the presented versions of  Lamia  confusing  and describing  St Agnes  as having a  sense of pettish disgust  and  a  Don Juan  style of mingling up sentiment and sneering  concluding it was  a poem unfit for ladies   The final volume Keats lived to see  Lamia  Isabella  The Eve of St  Agnes  and Other Poems  was eventually published in July 1820  It received greater acclaim than had Endymion or Poems  finding favourable notices in both The Examiner and Edinburgh Review  It would come to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published   Wentworth Place now houses the Keats House museum   1 4  Isabella Jones and Fanny Brawne  Keats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817  while on holiday in the village of Bo Peep  near Hastings  She is described as beautiful  talented and widely read  not of the top flight of society yet financially secure  an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keats s circle  Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitates to own his sexual attraction to her  although they seem to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment  He writes that he  frequented her rooms  in the winter of 1818–19  and in his letters to George says that he  warmed with her  and  kissed her   It is unclear how close they were  but Bate and Gittings suggest the trysts may represent a sexual initiation for Keats  Jones  greatest significance may be as an inspiration and steward of Keats s writing  The themes of  The Eve of St  Agnes  and  The Eve of St Mark  may well have been suggested by her  the lyric Hush  Hush    o sweet Isabel   was about her  and that the first version of  Bright Star  may have originally been for her  In 1821  Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keats s death   Letters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances  Fanny  Brawne between September and November 1818  It is likely that the 18 year old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there  She was born in the hamlet of West End  now in the district of West Hampstead   on 9 August 1800  Like Keats s grandfather  her grandfather kept a London inn  and both lost several family members to tuberculosis  She shared her first name with both Keats s sister and mother  and had a talent for dress making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent  During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats  but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats  whom John was nursing through this period   On 3 April 1819  Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke s Wentworth Place  and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day  Keats began to lend Brawne books  such as Dante s Inferno  and they would read together  He gave her the love sonnet  Bright Star   perhaps revised for her  as a declaration  It was a work in progress which he continued at until the last months of his life  and the poem came to be associated with their relationship   All his desires were concentrated on Fanny   From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones  Sometime before the end of June  he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne  far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer  with no prospects and financial stricture  Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne  Their love remained unconsummated  jealousy for his  star  began to gnaw at him  Darkness  disease and depression surrounded him  reflected in poems such as  The Eve of St  Agnes  and  La Belle Dame sans Merci  where love and death both stalk   I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks   he wrote to her      your loveliness  and the hour of my death    In one of his many hundreds of notes and letters  Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819   My love has made me selfish  I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my Life seems to stop there – I see no further  You have absorb d me  I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving – I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you     I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion – I have shudder d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr d for my Religion – Love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you    Tuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate  In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again  After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters  although he did correspond with her mother  He died there five months later  None of Brawne s letters to Keats survive   It took a month for the news of his death to reach London  after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years  In 1833  more than 12 years after his death  she married and went on to have three children  she outlived Keats by more than 40 years   1 5  Last months  Rome  During 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of tuberculosis  suffering two lung hemorrhages in the first few days of February  He lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician  Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer  At the suggestion of his doctors  he agreed to move to Italy with his friend Joseph Severn  On 13 September  they left for Gravesend and four days later boarded the sailing brig  Maria Crowther   where he made the final revisions of  Bright Star   The journey was a minor catastrophe  storms broke out followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship s progress  When they finally docked in Naples  the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of cholera in Britain  Keats reached Rome on 14 November  by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared   Keats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown   Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter  My stomach continues so bad  that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine  Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England  I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past  and that I am leading a posthumous existence    On arrival in Italy  he moved into a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome  today the Keats Shelley Memorial House museum  Despite care from Severn and Dr  James Clark  his health rapidly deteriorated  The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death  In November 1820  Clark declared that the source of his illness was  mental exertion  and that the source was largely situated in his stomach  Clark eventually diagnosed consumption  tuberculosis  and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach  He also bled the poet  a standard treatment of the day  but was likely a significant contributor to Keats s weakness  Severn s biographer Sue Brown writes   They could have used opium in small doses  and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage  What Severn didn t realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide  He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn t let him have it  Then in Rome he tried again    Severn was in such a quandary he didn t know what to do  so in the end he went to the doctor who took it away  As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all   Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum  opium   He repeatedly demanded  how long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on     1 6  Death  The first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis  Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat  Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive  Severn writes   John Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery  Rome  His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date  only the words   Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water   Severn and Brown erected the stone  which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings  includes the epitaph   There is a discrepancy of one day between the official date of death and that on the gravestone  Severn and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keats s work  Hunt blamed his death on the Quarterly Review s scathing attack of  Endymion   As Byron quipped in his narrative poem Don Juan   Tis strange the mind  that very fiery particle Should let itself be snuffed out by an article   canto 11  stanza 60   Seven weeks after the funeral Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem Adonaïs  Clark saw to the planting of daisies on the grave  saying that Keats would have wished it  For public health reasons  the Italian health authorities burned the furniture in Keats s room  scraped the walls  made new windows  doors and flooring  The ashes of Shelley  one of Keats s most fervent champions  are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats  Describing the site today  Marsh wrote   In the old part of the graveyard  barely a field when Keats was buried here  there are now umbrella pines  myrtle shrubs  roses  and carpets of wild violets    2  Reception  When Keats died at 25  he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years  from 1814 until the summer of 1820  and publishing for only four  In his lifetime  sales of Keats s three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies  His first poem  the sonnet O Solitude appeared in the Examiner in May 1816  while his collection Lamia  Isabella  The Eve of St  Agnes and other poems was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome  The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats s work   Although prolific during his short career  and now one of the most studied and admired British poets  his reputation rests on a small body of work  centred on the Odes  and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death  Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime  Aware that he was likely dying  he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820      other thoughts intrude upon me   If I should die   said I to myself   I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov d the principle of beauty in all things  and if I had had time I would have made myself remember d      Keats s ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt  His admirers praised him for thinking  on his pulses   for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities  more gorgeous in its effects  more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him   loading every rift with ore   Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome  and loudly declared that Keats s death had been brought on by bad reviews in the Quarterly Review  Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote Adonaïs  a despairing elegy  stating that Keats  early death was a personal and public tragedy  The loveliest and the last  The bloom  whose petals nipped before they blew Died on the promise of the fruit   Although Keats wrote that  if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all   poetry did not come easy to him  his work the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self education  He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft  His first attempts at verse were often vague  languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye  His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke  who first introduced him to the classics  and also came from the predilections of Hunt s Examiner  which Keats read as a boy  Hunt scorned the Augustan or  French  school  dominated by Pope  and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge  now in their forties  as unsophisticated  obscure and crude writers  Indeed  during Keats s few years as a published poet  the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb  Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work  identifying himself with a  new school  for a time  somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth  Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis from the scathing attacks from Blackwoods and The Quarterly  By the time of his death  Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools  the obscurity of the first wave Romantics and the uneducated affectation of Hunt s  Cockney School   Keats s posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers  caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of the hyper sensitive genius killed by high feeling  which Shelley later portrayed   The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted  Marked as the standard bearer of sensory writing  his reputation grew steadily and remarkably  His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles  whose members included the young Tennyson  later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century  In 1848  twenty seven years after Keats s death  Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography  which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature  The Pre Raphaelite Brotherhood  including Millais and Rossetti  were inspired by Keats  and painted scenes from his poems including  The Eve of St  Agnes    Isabella  and  La Belle Dame sans Merci   lush  arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats s work   In 1882  Swinburne wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica that  the Ode to a Nightingale   is  one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages   In the twentieth century  Keats remained the muse of poets such as Wilfred Owen  who kept his death date as a day of mourning  Yeats and T  S  Eliot  Critic Helen Vendler stated the odes  are a group of works in which the English language find ultimate embodiment   Bate declared of To Autumn   Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English  and M  R  Ridley claimed the ode  is the most serenely flawless poem in our language    The largest collection of the letters  manuscripts  and other papers of Keats is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University  Other collections of material are archived at the British Library  Keats House  Hampstead  the Keats Shelley Memorial House in Rome and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York  Since 1998 the British Keats Shelley Memorial Association have annually awarded a prize for romantic poetry  A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at Keats House   2 1  Biographers  None of Keats  biographies were written by people who had known him  Shortly after his death  his publishers announced they would speedily publish The memoirs and remains of John Keats but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to the extent that the project was abandoned  Leigh Hunt s Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries  1828  gives the first biographical account  strongly emphasising Keats s supposedly humble origins  a misconception which still continues  Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles  a succession of other publications followed  including anthologies of his many notes  chapters and letters  However  early accounts often gave contradictory or heavily biased versions of events and were subject to dispute  His friends Brown  Severn  Dilke  Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey  his publisher Taylor  Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats s life  These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend   Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony  who was  spiritualised  by his decline and too fine tuned to endure the harshness of life  the consumptive  suffering image popularly held today  The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes  Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin  Robert Gittings  Walter Jackson Bate and Andrew Motion  The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness  Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death  and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity   2 2  Other portrayals  The 2009 film Bright Star  written and directed by Jane Campion  focuses on Keats  relationship with Fanny Brawne  Inspired by the 1997 Keats biography penned by Andrew Motion  it stars Ben Whishaw as Keats and Abbie Cornish as Fanny   In Dan Simmons  science fiction novel Hyperion  Keats and his works play a major role in the story  and there are many references to him and his work in the book  he even appears as a central character  albeit a recreation of his personality through an AI functioning inside a cyborg body   3  Letters  Keats  letters were first published in 1848 and 1878  During the 19th century  critics deemed them unworthy of attention  distractions from his poetic works  During the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry  and are highly regarded within the canon of English literary correspondence  T  S  Eliot described them as  certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet   Keats spent a great deal of time considering poetry itself  its constructs and impacts  displaying a deep interest unusual amongst his milieu who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics  fashions or science  Eliot wrote of Keats s conclusions   There is hardly one statement of Keats  about poetry which     will not be found to be true  and what is more  true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote    Few of Keats s letters are extant from the period before he joined his literary circle  From spring 1817  however  there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive skills as letter writer  Keats and his friends  poets  critics  novelists  and editors wrote to each other daily  and Keats  ideas are bound up in the ordinary  his day to day missives sharing news  parody and social commentary  They glitter with humour and critical intelligence  Born of an  unself conscious stream of consciousness   they are impulsive  full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots  When his brother George went to America  Keats wrote to him in great detail  the body of letters becoming  the real diary  and self revelation of Keats s life  as well as containing an exposition of his philosophy  and the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats s finest writing and thought  Gittings describes them as akin to a  spiritual journal  not written for a specific other  so much as for synthesis   Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry  and specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe  In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters   Writing to his brother George  Keats explored the idea of the world as  the vale of Soul making   anticipating the great odes that he would write some months later  In the letters  Keats coined ideas such as the Mansion of Many Apartments and the Chameleon Poet  concepts that came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination  despite only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence  The poetical mind  Keats argued   has no self – it is every thing and nothing – It has no character – it enjoys light and shade     What shocks the virtuous philosopher  delights the camelion  chameleon  Poet  It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one  because they both end in speculation  A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence  because he has no Identity – he is continually in for – and filling some other Body – The Sun  the Moon  the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute – the poet has none  no identity – he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God s Creatures  He used the term negative capability to discuss the state in which we are  capable of being in uncertainties  Mysteries  doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason     Being  content with half knowledge  where one trusts in the heart s perceptions  He wrote later   I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart s affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime  creative of essential Beauty  again and again turning to the question of what it means to be a poet   My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk   Keats notes to Shelley  In September 1819  Keats wrote to Reynolds  How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air  A temperate sharpness about it      I never lik d the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye  better than the chilly green of spring  Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday s walk that I composed upon it   The final stanza of his last great ode   To Autumn  runs  Where are the songs of Spring  Ay  where are they  Think not of them  thou hast thy music too   While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day  And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue  Later  To Autumn became one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language  There are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats does not describe  He mentions little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to discuss them  There is a total absence of any reference to his parents  In his last year  as his health deteriorated  his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions  The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect  giving rise to widespread criticism at the time   4  Works  Keats s Poetry and Prose  Ed  Jeffrey N  Cox  New York  W W  Norton Co   2008  ISBN 978 0393924916  John Keats  Ed  Susan Wolfson  Longman
