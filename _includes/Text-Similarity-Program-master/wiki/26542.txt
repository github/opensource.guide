Ruth Fulton Benedict  June 5  1887September 17  1948  was an American anthropologist and folklorist   She was born in New York City  attended Vassar College and graduated in 1909  She entered graduate studies at Columbia University in 1919  where she studied under Franz Boas  She received her Ph D and joined the faculty in 1923  Margaret Mead  with whom she may have shared a romantic relationship  and Marvin Opler  were among her students and colleagues   Franz Boas  her teacher and mentor  has been called the father of American anthropology and his teachings and point of view are clearly evident in Benedict s work  Ruth Benedict was affected by the passionate love of Boas  her mentor  and continued it in her research and writing   Benedict held the post of President of the American Anthropological Association and was also a prominent member of the American Folklore Society  She became the first woman to be recognized as a prominent leader of a learned profession  She can be viewed as a transitional figure in her field  redirecting both anthropology and folklore away from the limited confines of culture trait diffusion studies and towards theories of performance as integral to the interpretation of culture  She studied the relationships between personality  art  language and culture  insisting that no trait existed in isolation or self sufficiency  a theory which she championed in her 1934 Patterns of Culture   1  Early life  1 1  Childhood  Benedict was born Ruth Fulton in New York City on June 5  1887  to Beatrice and Frederick Fulton  Her mother worked in the city as a schoolteacher  while her father pursued a promising career as a homeopathic doctor and surgeon  Although Mr  Fulton loved his work and research  it eventually led to his premature death  as he acquired an unknown disease during one of his surgeries in 1888  Due to his illness the family moved back to Norwich  New York to the farm of Ruth s maternal grandparents  the Shattucks  A year later he died  ten days after returning from a trip to Trinidad to search for a cure   Mrs  Fulton was deeply affected by her husband s passing  Any mention of him caused her to be overwhelmed by grief  every March she cried at church and in bed  Ruth hated her mother s sorrow and viewed it as a weakness  For her  the greatest taboos in life were crying in front of people and showing expressions of pain  She reminisced   I did not love my mother  I resented her cult of grief   Because of this  the psychological effects on her childhood were profound  for  in one stroke she  Ruth  experienced the loss of the two most nourishing and protective people around her—the loss of her father at death and her mother to grief    As a toddler  she contracted measles which left her partially deaf  which was not discovered until she began school  Ruth also had a fascination with death as a young child  When she was four years old her grandmother took her to see an infant that had recently died  Upon seeing the dead child s face  Ruth claimed that it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen   At age seven Ruth began to write short verses and read any book she could get her hands on  Her favorite author was Jean Ingelow and her favorite readings were A Legend of Bregenz and The Judas Tree  Through writing she was able to gain approval from her family  Writing was her outlet  and she wrote with an insightful perception about the realities of life  For example  in her senior year of high school she wrote a piece called   Lulu s Wedding  A True Story   in which she recalled the wedding of a family serving girl  Instead of romanticizing the event  she revealed the true  unromantic  arranged marriage that Lulu went through because the man would take her  even though he was much older   Although Ruth Benedict s fascination with death started at an early age  she continued to study how death affected people throughout her career  In her book Patterns of Culture  Benedict studied the Pueblo culture and how they dealt with grieving and death  She describes in the book that individuals may deal with reactions to death  such as frustration and grief  differently  Societies all have social norms that they follow  some allow more expression when dealing with death  such as mourning  while other societies are not allowed to acknowledge it   1 2  College and marriage  After high school  Margery  her sister  and Ruth were able to enter St Margaret s School for Girls  a college preparatory school  with help from a full time scholarship  The girls were successful in school and entered Vassar College in September 1905  During this time period stories were circulating that going to college led girls to become childless and never be married  Nevertheless  Ruth explored her interests in college and found writing as her way of expressing herself as an  intellectual radical  as she was sometimes called by her classmates  Author Walter Pater was a large influence on her life during this time as she strove to be like him and live a well lived life  She graduated with her sister in 1909 with a major in English Literature  Unsure of what to do after college  she received an invitation to go on an all expense paid tour around Europe by a wealthy trustee of the college  Accompanied by two girls from California that she d never met  Katherine Norton and Elizabeth Atsatt  she traveled through France  Switzerland  Italy  Germany  and England for one year  having the opportunity of various home stays throughout the trip   Over the next few years  Ruth took up many different jobs  First she tried paid social work for the Charity Organization Society and later she accepted a job as a teacher at the Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles  California  While working there she gained her interest in Asia that would later affect her choice of fieldwork as a working anthropologist  However  she was unhappy with this job as well and  after one year  left to teach English in Pasadena at the Orton School for Girls  These years were difficult  and she suffered from depression and severe loneliness  However  through reading authors like Walt Whitman and Jeffries that stressed a worth  importance and enthusiasm for life she held onto hope for a better future   The summer after her first year teaching at the Orton School she returned home to the Shattucks  farm to spend some time in thought and peace  There Stanley Benedict  a biochemist at Cornell Medical College  began to visit her at the farm  She had met him by chance in Buffalo  New York around 1910  That summer Ruth fell deeply in love with Stanley as he began to visit her more  and accepted his proposal for marriage  Invigorated by love  she undertook several writing projects in order to keep busy besides the everyday housework chores in her new life with Stanley  She began to publish poems under different pseudonyms—Ruth Stanhope  Edgar Stanhope  and Anne Singleton  She also began work on writing a biography about Mary Wollstonecraft and other lesser known women that she felt deserved more acknowledgement for their work and contributions  By 1918 the couple began to drift apart  Stanley suffered an injury that made him want to spend more time away from the city  and Benedict was not happy when the couple moved to Bedford Hills far away from the city   2  Career in Anthropology  2 1  Education and early career  In her search for a career  she decided to attend some lectures at the New School for Social Research while looking into the possibility of becoming an educational philosopher  While at the school  she took a class called  Sex in Ethnology  taught by Elsie Clews Parsons  She enjoyed the class and took another anthropology course with Alexander Goldenweiser  a student of noted anthropologist Franz Boas  With Goldenweiser as her teacher  Ruth s love for anthropology steadily grew  As close friend Margaret Mead explained   Anthropology made the first  sense  that any ordered approach to life had ever made to Ruth Benedict   After working with Goldenweiser for a year  he sent her to work as a graduate student with Franz Boas at Columbia University in 1921  She developed a close friendship with Boas  who took on a role as a kind of father figure in her life – Benedict lovingly referred to him as  Papa Franz    Boas gave her graduate credit for the courses that she had completed at the New School for Social Research  Benedict wrote her dissertation  The Concept of the Guardian Spirit in North America   and received the PhD in anthropology in 1923  Benedict also started a friendship with Edward Sapir who encouraged her to continue the study of the relations between individual creativity and cultural patterns  Sapir and Benedict shared an interest in poetry  and read and critiqued each other s work  both submitting to the same publishers and both being rejected  They also were both interested in psychology and the relation between individual personalities and cultural patterns  and in their correspondences they frequently psychoanalyzed each other  However  Sapir showed little understanding for Benedict s private thoughts and feelings  In particular  his conservative gender ideology jarred with Benedict s struggle for emancipation  While they were very close friends for a while  it was ultimately the differences in worldview and personality that led their friendship to strand   Benedict taught her first anthropology course at Barnard college in 1922 and among the students there was Margaret Mead  Benedict was a significant influence on Mead   Boas regarded Benedict as an asset to the anthropology department  and in 1931 he appointed her as Assistant Professor in Anthropology  something impossible until her divorce from Stanley Benedict that same year   One student who felt especially fond of Ruth Benedict was Ruth Landes  Letters that Landes sent to Benedict state that she was enthralled by the way in which Benedict taught her classes and with the way that she forced the students to think in an unconventional way   When Boas retired in 1937  most of his students considered Ruth Benedict to be the obvious choice for the head of the anthropology department  However  the administration of Columbia was not as progressive in its attitude towards female professionals as Boas had been  and the university President Nicholas Murray Butler was eager to curb the influence of the Boasians whom he considered to be political radicals  Instead  Ralph Linton  one of Boas s former students  a World War I veteran and a fierce critic of Benedict s  Culture and Personality  approach  was named head of the department  Benedict was understandably insulted by Linton s appointment and the Columbia department was divided between the two rival figures of Linton and Benedict  both accomplished anthropologists with influential publications  neither of whom ever mentioned the work of the other   2 2  Relationship with Margaret Mead  Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict are considered to be the two most influential and famous anthropologists of their time  One of the reasons Mead and Benedict got along well was because they both shared a passion for their work and they each felt a sense of pride at being a successful working woman during a time when this was uncommon  They were known to critique each other’s work frequently  they created a companionship that began through their work  but which also during the early period was of an erotic character  Both Benedict and Mead wanted to dislodge stereotypes about women during their time period and show that working women can be successful even though working society was seen as a man s world  In her memoir about her parents  With a Daughter s Eye  Margaret Mead s daughter implies that the relationship between Benedict and Mead was partly sexual  In 1946  Benedict received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women  After Benedict died of a heart attack in 1948  Mead kept the legacy of Benedict s work going by supervising projects that Benedict would have looked after  and editing and publishing notes from studies that Benedict had collected throughout her life   2 3  Post war  Before World War II began  Benedict was giving lectures at the Bryn Mawr College for the Anna Howard Shaw Memorial Lectureship  These lectures were focused around the idea of synergy  Yet  WWII made her focus on other areas of concentration of anthropology and the lectures were never presented in their entirety  After the war was over  she focused on finishing her book The Chrysanthemum and the Sword  It is important to note that her original notes for the synergy lecture were never found after her death  She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947  She continued her teaching after the war  advancing to the rank of full professor only two months before her death  in New York on September 17  1948   3  Work  3 1  Patterns of Culture  Benedict s Patterns of Culture  1934  was translated into fourteen languages and was published in many editions as standard reading for anthropology courses in American universities for years   The essential idea in Patterns of Culture is  according to the foreword by Margaret Mead   her view of human cultures as  personality writ large    As Benedict wrote in that book   A culture  like an individual  is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action   46   Each culture  she held  chooses from  the great arc of human potentialities  only a few characteristics which become the leading personality traits of the persons living in that culture  These traits comprise an interdependent constellation of aesthetics and values in each culture which together add up to a unique gestalt   For example  she described the emphasis on restraint in Pueblo cultures of the American southwest  and the emphasis on abandon in the Native American cultures of the Great Plains  She used the Nietzschean opposites of  Apollonian  and  Dionysian  as the stimulus for her thought about these Native American cultures  She describes how in ancient Greece  the worshipers of Apollo emphasized order and calm in their celebrations   In contrast  the worshipers of Dionysus  the god of wine  emphasized wildness  abandon  letting go  as did Native Americans  She described in detail the contrasts between rituals  beliefs  personal preferences amongst people of diverse cultures to show how each culture had a  personality  that was encouraged in each individual   Other anthropologists of the culture and personality school also developed these ideas  notably Margaret Mead in her Coming of Age in Samoa  published before  Patterns of Culture   and Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies  published just after Benedict s book came out   Benedict was a senior student of Franz Boas when Mead began to study with them  and they had extensive and reciprocal influence on each other s work  Abram Kardiner was also affected by these ideas  and in time  the concept of  modal personality  was born  the cluster of traits most commonly thought to be observed in people of any given culture   Benedict  in Patterns of Culture  expresses her belief in cultural relativism  She desired to show that each culture has its own moral imperatives that can be understood only if one studies that culture as a whole  It was wrong  she felt  to disparage the customs or values of a culture different from one s own  Those customs had a meaning to the people who lived them which should not be dismissed or trivialized  We should not try to evaluate people by our standards alone  Morality  she argued  was relative to the values of the culture in which one operated   As she described the Kwakiutl of the Pacific Northwest  based on the fieldwork of her mentor Boas   the Pueblo of New Mexico  among whom she had direct experience   the nations of the Great Plains  the Dobu culture of New Guinea  regarding whom she relied upon Mead and Reo Fortune s fieldwork   she gave evidence that their values  even where they may seem strange  are intelligible in terms of their own coherent cultural systems and should be understood and respected  This also formed a central argument in her later work on the Japanese following World War II   Critics have objected to the degree of abstraction and generalization inherent in the  culture and personality  approach  Some have argued that particular patterns she found may be only a part or a subset of the whole cultures  For example  David Friend Aberle writes that the Pueblo people may be calm  gentle  and much given to ritual when in one mood or set of circumstances  but they may be suspicious  retaliatory  and warlike in other circumstances   In 1936  she was appointed an associate professor at Columbia University  However  by then  Benedict had already assisted in the training and guidance of several Columbia students of anthropology including Margaret Mead and Ruth Landes   Benedict was among the leading cultural anthropologists who were recruited by the US government for war related research and consultation after the US entry into World War II   3 2   The Races of Mankind   One of Benedict s lesser known works was a pamphlet  The Races of Mankind  which she wrote with her colleague at the Columbia University Department of Anthropology  Gene Weltfish  This pamphlet was intended for American troops and set forth  in simple language with cartoon illustrations  the scientific case against racist beliefs    The world is shrinking  begin Benedict and Weltfish   Thirty seven nations are now united in a common cause—victory over Axis aggression  the military destruction of fascism   p  1   The nations united against fascism  they continue  include  the most different physical types of men    And the writers explicate  in section after section  the best evidence they knew for human equality  They want to encourage all these types of people to join together and not fight amongst themselves   The peoples of the earth   they point out   are one family  We all have just so many teeth  so many molars  just so many little bones and muscles—so we can only have come from one set of ancestors no matter what our color  the shape of our head  the texture of our hair   The races of mankind are what the Bible says they are—brothers  In their bodies is the record of their brotherhood    3 3  The Chrysanthemum and the Sword  Benedict is known not only for her earlier Patterns of Culture but also for her later book The Chrysanthemum and the Sword  the study of the society and culture of Japan that she published in 1946  incorporating results of her war time research   This book is an instance of Anthropology at a Distance  Study of a culture through its literature  through newspaper clippings  through films and recordings  etc   was necessary when anthropologists aided the United States and its allies in World War II  Unable to visit Nazi Germany or Japan under Hirohito  anthropologists made use of the cultural materials to produce studies at a distance  They were attempting to understand the cultural patterns that might be driving their aggression  and hoped to find possible weaknesses  or means of persuasion that had been missed   Benedict s war work included a major study  largely completed in 1944  aimed at understanding Japanese culture  Americans found themselves unable to comprehend matters in Japanese culture  For instance  Americans considered it quite natural for American prisoners of war to want their families to know they were alive  and to keep quiet when asked for information about troop movements  etc   while Japanese POWs  apparently  gave information freely and did not try to contact their families  Why was that  Why  too  did Asian peoples neither treat the Japanese as their liberators from Western colonialism  nor accept their own supposedly just place in a hierarchy that had Japanese at the top   Benedict played a major role in grasping the place of the Emperor of Japan in Japanese popular culture  and formulating the recommendation to President Franklin D  Roosevelt that permitting continuation of the Emperor s reign had to be part of the eventual surrender offer   Other Japanese who have read this work  according to Margaret Mead  found it on the whole accurate but somewhat  moralistic   Sections of the book were mentioned in Takeo Doi s book  The Anatomy of Dependence  though Doi is highly critical of Benedict s concept that Japan has a  shame  culture  whose emphasis is on how one s moral conduct appears to outsiders in contradistinction to America s  Christian   guilt  culture  in which the emphasis is on individual s internal conscience  Doi stated that this claim clearly implies the former value system is inferior to the latter one   Ayako Ishigaki s Diary says  on July 10 in 1947   Ruth Benedict s manuscript was almost all deleted  by U S  Department of the Army   I d known they would  but I was sad     4
