Tungsten  also known as wolfram  is a chemical element with symbol W and atomic number 74  The word tungsten comes from the Swedish language tung sten directly translatable to heavy stone  though the name is volfram in Swedish to distinguish it from Scheelite  which in Swedish is alternatively named tungsten   A hard  rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined  tungsten is found naturally on Earth only in chemical compounds  It was identified as a new element in 1781  and first isolated as a metal in 1783  Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite  The free element is remarkable for its robustness  especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements  Also remarkable is its high density of 19 3 times that of water  comparable to that of uranium and gold  and much higher  about 1 7 times  than that of lead  Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material due to its weak grain boundaries  making it difficult to work  However  pure single crystalline tungsten is more ductile  and can be cut with a hard steel hacksaw   Tungsten s many alloys have numerous applications  most notably in incandescent light bulb filaments  X ray tubes  as both the filament and target   electrodes in TIG welding  superalloys  and radiation shielding  About half is used in the form of tungsten carbide  a durable carbon alloy  Tungsten s hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles  Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts   Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules  where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea  It is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism  Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life   1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  In its raw form  tungsten is a hard steel grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work  If made very pure  tungsten retains its hardness  which exceeds that of many steels   and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily  It is worked by forging  drawing  or extruding  Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering   Of all metals in pure form  tungsten has the highest melting point  3 422 °C  6 192 °F   lowest vapor pressure  at temperatures above 1 650 °C  3 000 °F  and the highest tensile strength  Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten  carbon sublimes  rather than melts  so tungsten is considered to have a higher melting point  Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal  The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons  Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness   Tungsten exists in two major crystalline forms  α and β  The former has a body centered cubic structure and is the more stable form  The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic  it is metastable  but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities  Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains  the β form exhibits a columnar habit  The α phase has one third of the electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase  ca  0 015 K vs  1–4 K  mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values  The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal  e g  7 9 K for W Tc   Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low temperature superconducting circuits   1 2  Isotopes  Naturally occurring tungsten consists of five isotopes whose half lives are so long that they can be considered stable  Theoretically  all five can decay into isotopes of element 72  hafnium  by alpha emission  but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half life of  1 8 ± 0 2 ×1018 years  on average  this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year  The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay  constraining their half lives to be   Another 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized  the most stable of which are 181W with a half life of 121 2 days  185W with a half life of 75 1 days  188W with a half life of 69 4 days  178W with a half life of 21 6 days  and 187W with a half life of 23 72 h  All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than 3 hours  and most of these have half lives below 8 minutes  Tungsten also has 4 meta states  the most stable being 179mW  t1⁄2 6 4 minutes    1 3  Chemical properties  Elemental tungsten resists attack by oxygen  acids  and alkalis   The most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is +6  but it exhibits all oxidation states from −2 to +6  Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide  WO3  which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions     Tungsten carbides  W2C and WC  are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon  W2C is resistant to chemical attack  although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride  WCl6    In aqueous solution  tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions  As tungstate is progressively treated with acid  it first yields the soluble  metastable  paratungstate A  anion    which over time converts to the less soluble  paratungstate B  anion    Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion    after which equilibrium is reached  The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion  Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species  The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids  such as phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40   Tungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals  These are known as bronzes  an example is sodium tungsten bronze   2  History  In 1781  Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid  tungstic acid  could be made from scheelite  at the time named tungsten   Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid  In 1783  José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid  Later that year  in Spain  the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal  and they are credited with the discovery of the element   In World War II  tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings  Portugal  as the main European source of the element  was put under pressure from both sides  because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira  Tungsten s resistance to high temperatures and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry   2 1  Etymology  The name  tungsten   from the Swedish tung sten   heavy stone   is used in English  French  and many other languages as the name of the element  but not in the Nordic countries  Tungsten was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite  The other name  wolfram   or  volfram    is used in most European  especially Germanic and Slavic  languages  and is derived from the mineral wolframite  which is the origin of its chemical symbol  W  The name  wolframite  is derived from German  wolf rahm    wolf soot  or  wolf cream    the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747  This  in turn  derives from  Lupi spuma   the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546  which translates into English as  wolf s froth   and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction   3  Occurrence  Tungsten is found in the minerals wolframite  iron–manganese tungstate   Fe Mn WO4   scheelite  calcium tungstate   CaWO4   ferberite  FeWO4   and hübnerite  MnWO4    In 2010  world production of tungsten was about 61 000 tonnes  The main producers were as follows  data in tonnes    There is additional production in the U S   but the amount is proprietary company information  U S  reserves are 140 000 tonnes   Tungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  There is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of Dartmoor in the United Kingdom  which was exploited during World War I and World War II as the Hemerdon Mine  With recent increases in tungsten prices  this mine may be reactivated   4  Production  About 61 300 tonnes of tungsten concentrates were produced in the year 2009  Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages  The ore is eventually converted to tungsten VI  oxide  WO3   which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten  Because of tungsten s high melting point  it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots  Instead  powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals  and sintered  During the sintering process  the nickel diffuses into the tungsten  producing an alloy   Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF6   or pyrolytic decomposition   Tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange  The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO3  If converted to the metal equivalent  they were about US$19 per kilogram in 2009   5  Applications  Approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials – namely tungsten carbide – with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels  Less than 10% is used in other chemical compounds   5 1  Hard materials  Tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide  one of the hardest carbides  with a melting point of 2770 °C  WC is an efficient electrical conductor  but W2C is less so  WC is used to make wear resistant abrasives  and  carbide  cutting tools such as knives  drills  circular saws  milling and turning tools used by the metalworking  woodworking  mining  petroleum and construction industries  Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic metal composite  where metallic cobalt acts as a binding  matrix  material to hold the WC particles in place  This type of industrial use accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption   The jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide  tungsten carbide metal composites  and also metallic tungsten  WC metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished  Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal  but it is a ceramic  Because of tungsten carbide s hardness  rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant  and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten  Tungsten carbide rings are brittle  however  and may crack under a sharp blow   5 2  Alloys  The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys  A good example is high speed steel  which can contain as much as 18% tungsten  Tungsten s high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles  for example in the UGM 27 Polaris submarine launched ballistic missile  Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of different applications  including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding  Superalloys containing tungsten  such as Hastelloy and Stellite  are used in turbine blades and wear resistant parts and coatings   5 3  Armaments  Tungsten  usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys  is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium  in applications where uranium s radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form  or where uranium s additional pyrophoric properties are not required  for example  in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor   Similarly  tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells  grenades and missiles  to create supersonic shrapnel  Tungsten has also been used in Dense Inert Metal Explosives  which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius   5 4  Chemical applications  Tungsten IV  sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization  MoS2 is more commonly used for such applications   Tungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting  Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine  Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries   Tungsten oxide  WO3  is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction  SCR  catalysts found in coal fired power plants  These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides  NOx  to nitrogen  N2  and water  H2O  using ammonia  NH3   The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life   5 5  Niche uses  Applications requiring its high density include weights  counterweights  ballast keels for yachts  tail ballast for commercial aircraft  and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One  depleted uranium is also used for these purposes  due to similarly high density  75 kg blocks of tungsten were used as  cruise balance mass devices  on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft  It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting  where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar  High density alloys of tungsten with nickel  copper or iron are used in high quality darts  to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings  or for fishing lures  tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly   Some types of strings for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wires   Sodium tungstate is used in Folin Ciocalteu s reagent  a mixture of different chemicals used in the  Lowry Assay  for protein content analysis   5 6  Gold substitution  Its density  similar to that of gold  allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum  Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic  and is harder than gold alloys  though not as hard as tungsten carbide   making it useful for rings that will resist scratching  especially in designs with a brushed finish   Because the density is so similar to that of gold  tungsten is only 0 36% less dense   tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars  such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold  which has been observed since the 1980s  or taking an existing gold bar  drilling holes  and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods  The densities are not exactly the same  and other properties of gold and tungsten differ  but gold plated tungsten will pass superficial tests   Gold plated tungsten is available commercially from China  the main source of tungsten   both in jewelry and as bars   5 7  Electronics  Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point  elemental tungsten is used in many high temperature applications  such as light bulb  cathode ray tube  and vacuum tube filaments  heating elements  and rocket engine nozzles  Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high temperature uses such as electrical  heating  and welding applications  notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process  also called tungsten inert gas  TIG  welding    Because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness  tungsten is also used in electrodes  and in the emitter tips in electron beam instruments that use field emission guns  such as electron microscopes  In electronics  tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits  between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors  It is used in metallic films  which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten  or molybdenum  on silicon   The electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X ray targets  and also for shielding from high energy radiations  such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of FDG   It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made  due to its excellent shielding properties  Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites  which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets  shot  and radiation shields  Since this element s thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass  it is used for making glass to metal seals   6  Biological role  Tungsten  at atomic number 74  is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional  with the next heaviest being iodine  Z   53   It is used by some bacteria  but not in eukaryotes  For example  enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten pterin complex with molybdopterin  molybdopterin  despite its name  does not contain molybdenum  but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms   Tungsten using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes  The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations  The first tungsten requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium  and in this case the tungsten selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum sulfur pairing of some molybdenum cofactor requiring enzymes  One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten  bacterial formate dehydrogenase H  is known to use a selenium molybdenum version of molybdopterin  Although a tungsten containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten molydopterin and also non protein bound selenium  a tungsten selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described   In soil  tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion  It can be selectively or non selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes  Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive  The soil s chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes  alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates  acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates   Sodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms  Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic  but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability   Tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist  in a role similar to the action of molybdenum  It has been found that tetrathiotungstates may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals  similar to the tetrathiomolybdates   7  Precautions  Because tungsten is rare and its compounds are generally inert  the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited  The median lethal dose LD50 depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59 mg kg  intravenous  rabbits  and 5000 mg kg  tungsten metal powder  intraperitoneal  rats    8  Patent claim  Tungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings  In 1928  a US court rejected General Electric s attempt to patent it  overturning granted in 1913 to William D  Coolidge   9  See also  Field
