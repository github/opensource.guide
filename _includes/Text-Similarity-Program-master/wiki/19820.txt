Magick  in the context of Aleister Crowley s Thelema  is a term used to differentiate the occult from stage magic and is defined as  the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will   including both  mundane  acts of will as well as ritual magic  Crowley wrote that  it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature   John Symonds and Kenneth Grant attach a deeper occult significance to this preference   Crowley saw Magick as the essential method for a person to reach true understanding of the self and to act according to one s true will  which he saw as the reconciliation  between freewill and destiny   Crowley describes this process in his Magick  Book 4   1  Definitions and general purpose of Magick  The term itself is an Early Modern English spelling for magic  used in works such as the 1651 translation of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa s De Occulta Philosophia  Three Books of Occult Philosophy  or Of Magick  Aleister Crowley chose the spelling to differentiate his practices and rituals from stage magic and the term has since been re popularised by those who have adopted elements of his teachings   Crowley defined Magick as  the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will   He goes on to elaborate on this  in one postulate  and twenty eight theorems  His first clarification on the matter is that of a postulate  in which he states  ANY required change may be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner  through the proper medium to the proper object   He goes on further to state   2  Paranormal effects  Crowley made many theories for the paranormal effects of Magick  however  as magicians and mystics had done before him and continue to do after him  Crowley dismissed such effects as useless   Even so  Crowley recognized that paranormal effects and magical powers have some level of value for the individual   3  Techniques of Magick  There are several ways to view what Magick is  Again  at its most broad  it can be defined as any willed action leading to intended change  It can also be seen as the general set of methods used to accomplish the Great Work of mystical attainment  At the practical level  Magick most often takes several practices and forms of ritual  including banishing  invocation and evocation  eucharistic ritual  consecration and purification  astral travel  yoga  sex magic  and divination   3 1  Banishing  The professed purpose of banishing rituals is to eliminate forces that might interfere with a magical operation  and they are often performed at the beginning of an important event or ceremony  although they can be performed for their own sake as well   The area of effect can be a magick circle  a room  or the magician himself  The general theory of Magick proposes that there are various forces which are represented by the classical elements  air  earth  fire  and water   the planets  the signs of the Zodiac  and adjacent spaces in the astral world  Magick also proposes that various spirits and non corporeal intelligences can be present  Banishings are performed in order to  clean out  these forces and presences  It is not uncommon to believe that banishings are more psychological than anything else  used to calm and balance the mind  but that the effect is ultimately the same—a sense of cleanliness within the self and the environment  There are many banishing rituals  but most are some variation on two of the most common— The Star Ruby  and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram   Crowley describes banishing in his Magick  Book 4  ch 13    However  he further asserts   3 2  Purification  Purification is similar in theme to banishing  but is a more rigorous process of preparing the self and her temple for serious spiritual work  Crowley mentions that ancient magicians would purify themselves through arduous programs  such as through special diets  fasting  sexual abstinence  keeping the body meticulously tidy  and undergoing a complicated series of prayers  He goes on to say that purification no longer requires such activity  since the magician can purify the self via willed intention  Specifically  the magician labors to purify the mind and body of all influences which may interfere with the Great Work   Crowley recommended symbolically ritual practices  such as bathing and robing before a main ceremony   The bath signifies the removal of all things extraneous or antagonistic to the one thought  The putting on of the robe is the positive side of the same operation  It is the assumption of the frame of mind suitable to that one thought    3 3  Consecration  Consecration is an equally important magical operation  It is essentially the dedication  usually of a ritual instrument or space  to a specific purpose  In Magick  Book 4  ch 13   Crowley writes   3 4  Invocation  Invocation is the bringing in or identifying with a particular deity or spirit  Crowley wrote of two keys to success in this arena  to  inflame thyself in praying  and to  invoke often   For Crowley  the single most important invocation  or any act of Magick for that matter  was the invocation of one s Holy Guardian Angel  or  secret self   which allows the adept to know his or her True Will   Crowley describes the experience of invocation   Crowley  Magick  Book 4  discusses three main categories of invocation  although  in the great essentials these three methods are one  In each case the magician identifies himself with the Deity invoked    Devotion—where  identity with the God is attained by love and by surrender  by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant  and illusionary  parts of yourself    Calling forth—where  identity is attained by paying special attention to the desired part of yourself    Drama—where  identity is attained by sympathy  It is very difficult for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel  but for those who can do so  this method is unquestionably the best   Another invocatory technique that the magician can employ is called the assumption of godforms—where with  concentrated imagination of oneself in the symbolic shape of any God  one should be able to identify oneself with the idea which  the god  represents   A general method involves positioning the body in a position that is typical for a given god  imagining that the image of the god is coinciding with or enveloping the body  accompanied by the practice of  vibration  of the appropriate god name s    3 5  Evocation  There is a distinct difference between invocation and evocation  as Crowley explains   Generally  evocation is used for two main purposes  to gather information and to obtain the services or obedience of a spirit or demon  Crowley believed that the most effective form of evocation was found in the grimoire on Goetia  see below   which instructs the magician in how to safely summon forth and command 72 infernal spirits  However  it is equally possible to evoke angelic beings  gods  and other intelligences related to planets  elements  and the Zodiac   Unlike with invocation  which involves a calling in  evocation involves a calling forth  most commonly into what is called the  triangle of art    3 6  Astral travel  Astral body  Body of light  Rising on the planes  Trances and visions  3 7  Eucharist  The word eucharist originally comes from the Greek word for thanksgiving  However  within Magick  it takes on a special meaning—the transmutation of ordinary things  usually food and drink  into divine sacraments  which are then consumed  The object is to infuse the food and drink with certain properties  usually embodied by various deities  so that the adept takes in those properties upon consumption  Crowley describes the process of the regular practice of eucharistic ritual   There are several eucharistic rituals within the magical canon  Two of the most well known are The Mass of the Phoenix and The Gnostic Mass  The first is a ritual designed for the individual  which involves sacrificing a  Cake of Light   a type of bread that serves as the host  to Ra  i e  the Sun  and infusing a second Cake with the adept s own blood  either real or symbolic  in a gesture reflecting the myth of the Pelican cutting its own breast to feed its young  and then consuming it with the words   There is no grace  there is no guilt  This is the Law  Do what thou wilt   The other ritual  The Gnostic Mass  is a very popular public ritual  although it can be practiced privately  that involves a team of participants  including a Priest and Priestess  This ritual is an enactment of the mystical journey that culminates with the Mystic Marriage and the consumption of a Cake of Light and a goblet of wine  a process termed  communication    Afterwards  each Communicant declares   There is no part of me that is not of the gods    3 8  Yoga  Generally speaking  Yoga is not considered to be Magick per se   by those who are really familiar with it  But in verity  it is the necessary training of the body and the mind to allow for certain types of illumination of the soul and the person himself to take place  Simply put  the goal is the control of the mind—to increase concentration and to be able to enter different states of consciousness  When developing his basic yogic program  Crowley borrowed heavily from many other yogis  such as Patanjali and Yajnavalkya   Yoga  as Crowley interprets it  involves several key components  The first is Asana  which is the assumption  after eventual success  of any easy  steady and comfortable posture so as to maintain a good physique which complements the high level of enlightenment that meditation is accompanied with  Next is Pranayama  which is the control of breath  yogi s believe that the number of breaths a human takes are counted before one is even born and thus  by controlling the intake one may also be able to control the life  Mantram  the use of mantras enables the subject to use the knowledge of the Vedas  Atharva Veda  in this context adequately  Yama and Niyama are the adopted moral or behavioral codes  of the adept s choosing  that will be least likely to excite the mind  Pratyahara is the stilling of the thoughts so that the mind becomes quiet  Dharana is the beginning of concentration  usually on a single shape  like a triangle  which eventually leads to Dhyana  the loss of distinction between object and subject  which can be described as the annihilation of the ego  or sense of a separate self   The final stage is Samādhi—Union with the All  it is considered to be the utmost level of awareness that one could possibly achieve  according to Hindu mythology  one of their main three deities  Shiva  had mastered this and thus was bestowed upon with stupendous power and control   3 9  Divination  The art of divination is generally employed for the purpose of obtaining information that can guide the adept in his Great Work  The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences  either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner  that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols  Normally  divination within Magick is not the same as fortune telling  which is more interested in predicting future events  Rather  divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition of things that can help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions   There are literally hundreds of different divinatory techniques in the world  However  Western occult practice mostly includes the use of astrology  calculating the influence of heavenly bodies   bibliomancy  reading random passages from a book  such as Liber Legis or the I Ching   tarot  a deck of 78 cards  each with symbolic meaning  usually laid out in a meaningful pattern   and geomancy  a method of making random marks on paper or in earth that results in a combination of sixteen patterns    It is an accepted truism within Magick that divination is imperfect  As Crowley writes   In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment  one must allow for more than the numerous sources of error inherent in the process itself  The judgment can do no more than the facts presented to it warrant  It is naturally impossible in most cases to make sure that some important factor has not been omitted       One must not assume that the oracle is omniscient    3 10  Other magical practices  3 10 1  Qabalah and the Tree of Life  The Tree of Life is a tool used to categorize and organize various mystical concepts  At its most simple level  it is composed of ten spheres  or emanations  called sephiroth  sing   sephira   which are connected by twenty two paths  The sephiroth are represented by the planets and the paths by the characters of the Hebrew alphabet  which are subdivided by the four classical elements  the seven classical planets  and the twelve signs of the Zodiac  Within the western magical tradition  the Tree is used as a kind of conceptual filing cabinet  Each sephira and path is assigned various ideas  such as gods  cards of the Tarot  astrological planets and signs  elements  etc   Crowley considered a deep understanding of the Tree of Life to be essential to the magician   Similar to yoga  learning the Tree of Life is not so much Magick as it is a way to map out one s spiritual universe  As such  the adept may use the Tree to determine a destination for astral travel  to choose which gods to invoke for what purposes  et cetera  It also plays an important role in modeling the spiritual journey  where the adept begins in Malkuth  which is the every day material world of phenomena  with the ultimate goal being at Kether  the sphere of Unity with the All   3 10 2  Magical record  A magical record is a journal or other source of documentation containing magical events  experiences  ideas  and any other information that the magician may see fit to add  There can be many purposes for such a record  such as recording evidence to verify the effectiveness of specific procedures  per the scientific method that Aleister Crowley claimed should be applied to the practice of Magick  or to ensure that data may propagate beyond the lifetime of the magician  Benefits of this process vary  but usually include future analysis and further education by the individual and or associates with whom the magician feels comfortable in revealing such intrinsically private information   Crowley was highly insistent upon the importance of this practice  As he writes in Liber E   It is absolutely necessary that all experiments should be recorded in detail during  or immediately after  their performance     The more scientific the record is  the better  Yet the emotions should be noted  as being some of the conditions  Let then the record be written with sincerity and care  thus with practice it will be found more and more to approximate to the ideal   Other items he suggests for inclusion include the physical and mental condition of the experimenter  the time and place  and environmental conditions  including the weather   4  Components of ritual magic  4 1  Magical weapons  As with Magick itself  a magical weapon is any instrument used to bring about intentional change  As Crowley writes   Illustration  It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge  I therefore take  magical weapons   pen  ink  and paper     The composition and distribution of this book is thus an act of Magick by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will   With that said  in practice  magical weapons are usually specific  consecrated items used within ceremonial magic  There is no hard and fast rule for what is or isn t a magical weapon—if a magician considers it such a weapon  then it is  However  there does exist a set of magical weapons that have particular uses and symbolic meanings  Common weapons include the dagger  or athame in neopagan parlance   sword  wand  holy oil  cup  or graal   disk  or pentacle   oil lamp  bell  and thurible  or censer    4 2  Magical formulae  A magical formula is generally a name  word  or series of letters whose meaning illustrates principles and degrees of understanding that are often difficult to relay using other forms of speech or writing  It is a concise means to communicate very abstract information through the medium of a word or phrase  usually regarding a process of spiritual or mystical change  Common formulae include INRI  IAO  ShT  AUMGN  NOX  and LVX   These words often have no intrinsic meaning in and of themselves  However  when deconstructed  each individual letter may refer to some universal concept found in the system that the formula appears  Additionally  in grouping certain letters together one is able to display meaningful sequences that are considered to be of value to the spiritual system that utilizes them  e g  spiritual hierarchies  historiographic data  psychological stages  etc    4 3  Vibration of god names  In magical rituals involving the invocation of deities  a vocal technique called vibration is commonly used  This was a basic aspect of magical training for Crowley  who described it in  Liber O   According to that text  vibration involves a physical set of steps  starting in a standing position  breathing in through the nose while imagining the name of the god entering with the breath  imagining that breath travelling through the entire body  stepping forward with the left foot while throwing the body forward with arms outstretched  visualizing the name rushing out when spoken  ending in an upright stance  with the right forefinger placed upon the lips  According to Crowley in  Liber O   success in this technique is signaled by physical exhaustion and  though only by the student himself is it perceived  when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth  as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders  and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe  and not from himself    In general ritual practice  vibration can also refer to a technique of saying a god name or a magical formula in a long  drawn out fashion  i e  with a full  deep breath  that employs the nasal passages  such that the sound feels and sounds  vibrated   This is known as Galdering   5  See also   General  Folk magic
