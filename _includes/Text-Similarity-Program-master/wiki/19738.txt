In topology and related areas of mathematics  a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space  That is  a topological space is said to be metrizable if there is a metric  such that the topology induced by d is   Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable   1  Properties  Metrizable spaces inherit all topological properties from metric spaces  For example  they are Hausdorff paracompact spaces  and hence normal and Tychonoff  and first countable  However  some properties of the metric  such as completeness  cannot be said to be inherited  This is also true of other structures linked to the metric  A metrizable uniform space  for example  may have a different set of contraction maps than a metric space to which it is homeomorphic   2  Metrization theorems  One of the first widely recognized metrization theorems was Urysohn s metrization theorem  This states that every Hausdorff second countable regular space is metrizable  So  for example  every second countable manifold is metrizable   Historical note  The form of the theorem shown here was in fact proved by Tychonoff in 1926  What Urysohn had shown  in a paper published posthumously in 1925  was that every second countable normal Hausdorff space is metrizable   The converse does not hold  there exist metric spaces that are not second countable  for example  an uncountable set endowed with the discrete metric  The Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem  described below  provides a more specific theorem where the converse does hold   Several other metrization theorems follow as simple corollaries to Urysohn s Theorem  For example  a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second countable   Urysohn s Theorem can be restated as  A topological space is separable and metrizable if and only if it is regular  Hausdorff and second countable  The Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem extends this to the non separable case  It states that a topological space is metrizable if and only if it is regular  Hausdorff and has a σ locally finite base  A σ locally finite base is a base which is a union of countably many locally finite collections of open sets  For a closely related theorem see the Bing metrization theorem   Separable metrizable spaces can also be characterized as those spaces which are homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube   i e  the countably infinite product of the unit interval  with its natural subspace topology from the reals  with itself  endowed with the product topology   A space is said to be locally metrizable if every point has a metrizable neighbourhood  Smirnov proved that a locally metrizable space is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and paracompact  In particular  a manifold is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact   3  Examples  The group of unitary operators on a separable Hilbert space endowed with the strong operator topology is metrizable  see Proposition II 1 in     4  Examples of non metrizable spaces  Non normal spaces cannot be metrizable  important examples include  the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety or on the spectrum of a ring  used in algebraic geometry   the topological vector space of all functions from the real line R to itself  with the topology of pointwise convergence  The real line with the lower limit topology is not metrizable  The usual distance function is not a metric on this space because the topology it determines is the usual topology  not the lower limit topology  This space is Hausdorff  paracompact and first countable   The long line is locally metrizable but not metrizable  in a sense it is  too long    5  See also  Uniformizability  the property of a topological space of being homeomorphic to a uniform space  or equivalently the topology being defined by a family of pseudometrics  Moore space  topology   Apollonian metric  Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem  Bing metrization theorem  6  References
