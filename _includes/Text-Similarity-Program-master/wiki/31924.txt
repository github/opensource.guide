legislature passed the University Farm Bill  which called for the establishment of a farm school for the University of California  at the time  Berkeley was the sole campus of the university   The commission took a year to select a site for the campus  a tiny town then known as Davisville  UC  Davis opened its doors as the  University Farm  to 40 degree students  all male  from UC Berkeley in January 1909   The farm had begun accepting students in non degree farmers  short courses in October 1908  around 115 men attended    The Farm was established largely the result of the vision and perseverance of Peter J  Shields  secretary of the State Agricultural Society  The Peter J  Shields Library at UC Davis was named in his honor  Shields began to champion the cause of a University Farm to teach agriculture after learning that California students were going to out of state universities to pursue such education  Shields later said    There was a College of Agriculture at Berkeley in connection with the University of California  but it was purely academic  It was largely confined to the study of botany and chemistry  it had no farm and little prestige  it was apt to be thought of as a snap curriculum  attracting students who wanted to go to college but wanted to avoid its more difficult work   After two failed bills  a law authorizing the creation of a University Farm was passed on March 18  1905  Yolo County  home to some of California s prime farmland  was chosen as the site  A committee appointed by the Regents purchased land near Davisville  now Davis  in 1906  The Regents officially took control of the property in September 1906 and constructed four buildings in 1907   Short courses were first offered in 1908 and a three year non degree program set up in 1909  In 1911  the first class graduated from the University Farm  The Farm accepted its first female students in 1914 from Berkeley  The three year non degree program continued until 1923   At that time  a two year non degree program began  continuing until 1958  In 1922  a four year undergraduate general academic program was established  with the first class graduating in 1926   Renamed in 1922 as the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture  the institution continued growing at a breakneck pace  in 1916 the Farm s 314 students occupied the original campus  By 1951 it had expanded to a size of   In 1959  the campus was declared by the Regents of the University of California as the seventh general campus in the University of California system   Davis  Graduate Division was established in 1961 followed by the College of Engineering in 1962  The Law School opened for classes in Fall 1966  and the School of Medicine began instruction in Fall 1968   1 1  2011 pepper spray incident  During a protest against tuition hikes on November 18  2011  a campus police officer  Lieutenant John Pike  used pepper spray on seated students because they wouldn t move  The incident drew international attention and led to further demonstrations  a formal investigation  and Pike s departure in July 2012   2  Campus  2 1  Size and location  Though named after the City of Davis  the campus is technically located adjacent to the City of Davis in an unincorporated part of Yolo and Solano counties  The main campus is located west of Sacramento in the Sacramento Valley  part of California s Central Valley  and is adjacent to Interstate Highway 80  The Davis campus is the only school within the UC system with an airport  just west of main campus  and is one of two UC schools with its own fire department  the other being UC Santa Cruz  The campus is also located approximately an hour away from both San Francisco and the Napa Valley and two hours from Lake Tahoe  It is also one of only three schools in the University of California system  the others being UC Berkeley and UC Irvine  with a nuclear lab   The city of Davis is a college town  with the ratio of students to long term residents estimated at 1 4  Also contributing to the college town environment is the close proximity of downtown Davis to the campus  main quad—a matter of a few blocks  and 5 10 minute walk or bike ride  Davis  15 minute distance from Sacramento provides it with both the isolation critical to fostering a college town environment while also providing a lively and large metropolitan area nearby  Though the campus itself is vast  the entire community of Davis is relatively small and is easily traversable on bike utilizing Davis  extensive bicycle trails   2 2  Campus Core Quad  Towards the northeast end of campus is the Quad  a large rectangular field  which was the historic geographic center of campus  Earlier in the campus  history  the few campus buildings surrounded the four sides of the Quad  Today  though the campus has grown significantly and the geographic center of campus has shifted  the Quad remains the center of campus life  anchored to the north by the Memorial Union  student union   to the south by Shields Library and to the West and Southeast by Wellman and Olson Halls respectively   The Memorial Union Complex houses Freeborn Hall and the Memorial Union  which

UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine  the California Raptor Center  and the Center for Health & Environment   2 4  West Campus  For most of UC Davis  history  West Campus has served primarily as agricultural research land  Recently  portions were developed through a $300 million public private partnership to form the largest zero net energy community in the United States  known as UC Davis West Village  West Village will provide housing for 3 000 students  faculty and staff and will help the university recruit and retain top faculty  The project will include 662 apartments  343 single family homes  42 500 square feet of commercial space  a recreation center and study facilities  West Village will also host the first community college on a UC campus   The classes held in this area mainly involve plant sciences  but also include entomology courses as well  Students in the plant sciences maintain gardens as part of the PLS 5 lab while Entomology 156L and 158 students embark on field trips to sample fish for parasites at Putah Creek and conduct projects in forensic entomology at the UC Davis ecosystem  respectively   West Campus is also home to the University Airport  Foundation Plant Services  the California National Primate Research Center  and the Contained Research Facility  a bio safety level 3 facility   2 5  Arboretum  To the south side of the campus core is

NCAA Division I sports in the Big West Conference  For football  the Aggies compete in Division I FCS  formerly known as Division I AA   and are members of the Big Sky Conference  granting UC Davis the distinction of being one of only three UC campuses to field a football team  Cal and UCLA being the other two   The Aggies are also members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in gymnastics and lacrosse  the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association and Davis Men s Crew Club for rowing   The UC Davis Men s Crew Club is one of the more successful clubs both on campus and in the West  In 2008 the JV boat won first in nationals at the ACRA Championships in Tennessee and in 2009 the Varsity boat got second place in nationals at the ACRA Championships  They consistently compete against teams such as Stanford  the University of Washington and UC Berkeley   The Aggies finished first in NCAA Division II six times in 2003 and won the NACDA Directors  Cup 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003  In 1998  the UC Davis men s basketball team won the NCAA Division II national championship despite being one of the few non scholarship institutions in Division II at that time  They have also won NCAA Division II championships in Softball  2003   Men s Tennis  1992   and Women s Tennis  1990  1993   These and other achievements motivated a decision  following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators  faculty  staff  students  alumni and the local community  in 2003 for the athletics program to re classify to Division I   The highlight of UC Davis s 4 year transition to Division I occurred on September 17  2005  when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium by a score of 20 17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game  The Aggies also pulled off an upset against Stanford in basketball just months later  beating the Cardinal 64 58 with a late rally at home on December 4  2005  The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies  win loss record with Stanford to 5 1 for men s sports the 05 06 year   The Aggie football team plays Sacramento State in the annual Causeway Classic for the Causeway Carriage  The team also plays Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the annual Battle for the Golden Horseshoe  UC Davis students gather at sporting events to rally as the Aggie Pack  the largest student run school spirit organization in the United States  The Aggie Pack cheers on the sports team along with the to the music of the Cal Aggie Marching Band uh  and its alumni band  Aggie Stadium is the home of the UC Davis football and lacrosse teams   UC Davis had a wrestling program  which competed in the Pac 10 at the Division I level  In 2007  UC Davis wrestler Derek Moore gained All American status  as well as winning the NCAA Division I Championships for his weight class  Moore also received the  Most Outstanding Wrestler  award of the NCAA tournament  In doing so  Derek Moore became the first UC Davis student athlete to become a NCAA champion at the Division I level  That same year  UC Davis finished within the top 25 for Division I collegiate wrestling programs in the country   Because of budget pressure  Wrestling was cut from the athletic department in April 2010  Other cuts included men s swimming  men s indoor track  and women s rowing  The athletics department had to cut $1 79 million out of the budget  14 women s teams and 9 men s teams were funded for the 2010 2011 school year   The official school colors are blue and gold  The blue is due to the UC s early connection to Yale and as a result is often referred to as  Yale Blue   e g   see   and UCD s official blue  usually called  Aggie Blue   is Pantone 295  which is distinct from Yale Blue  approximately Pantone 289    The official school mascot is the mustang  Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school s origins in agricultural studies  Unlike most colleges  there is a distinction between the name for students and the mascot  Some students supported changing the
