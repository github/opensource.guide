Roy Kelton Orbison  April 23  1936 – December 6  1988   also known by the nickname the Big O  was an American singer songwriter  best known for his trademark sunglasses  distinctive  powerful voice  complex compositions  and dark emotional ballads  Orbison grew up in Texas and began singing in a rockabilly country and western band in high school until he was signed by Sun Records in Memphis  His greatest success came with Monument Records between 1960 and 1964  when 22 of his songs placed on the Billboard Top 40  including  Only the Lonely    Crying   and  Oh  Pretty Woman   His career stagnated through the 1970s  but was revived by several covers of his songs and the use of  In Dreams  in David Lynch s film Blue Velvet  1986    In 1988  he joined the Traveling Wilburys supergroup with George Harrison  Bob Dylan  Tom Petty  and Jeff Lynne and also released a new solo album  He died of a heart attack in December that year  at the zenith of his resurgence  His life was marred by tragedy  including the death of his first wife and his two eldest sons in separate accidents   Orbison s vocal instrument bridged the gap between baritone and tenor  and music scholars have suggested that he had a three  or four octave range  The combination of Orbison s powerful  impassioned voice and complex musical arrangements led many critics to refer to his music as operatic  giving him the sobriquet  the Caruso of Rock   Elvis Presley as well as Petty and Dylan  have stated his voice was  respectively  the greatest and most distinctive they had ever heard  While most male performers in rock and roll in the 1950s and  60s projected a defiant masculinity  many of Orbison s songs instead conveyed a quiet  desperate vulnerability  He was known for performing while standing still and solitary and for wearing black clothes and dark sunglasses  which lent an air of mystery to his persona   Orbison was initiated into the second class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 by longtime admirer Bruce Springsteen  The same year he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame  and the Songwriters Hall of Fame two years later  Rolling Stone placed Orbison at number 37 on their list of The Greatest Artists of All Time  and number 13 on their list of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time  In 2002  Billboard magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists  In 2014  Orbison was elected to America s Pop Music Hall of Fame   1  Early life  Roy Orbison was born in Vernon  Texas  the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison  1913–1984   an oil well driller and car mechanic  and Nadine Shultz  1914–1992   a nurse  Both of Orbison s parents were unemployed during the Great Depression  Searching for work  the family moved to Fort Worth during his childhood  He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School  until a polio scare prompted them to return to Vernon  Later  the family moved to Wink  Texas  Orbison would later describe the major components of life in Wink as  football  oil fields  oil  grease and sand  and in later years expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town  All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight  Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age  Orbison was not particularly confident in his appearance  he began dyeing his nearly white hair black when he was young  He was quiet and self effacing  remarkably polite and obliging—a product  biographer Alan Clayson wrote  of his Southern upbringing  However  Orbison was readily available to sing and often became the focus of attention when he did  He considered his voice memorable if not great   On his sixth birthday  Orbison s father gave him a guitar  Orbison later recalled that  by the age of seven   I was finished  you know  for anything else   music would be his life  Orbison s major musical influences as a youth were in country music  He was particularly moved by the way Lefty Frizzell sang  slurring syllables  He also enjoyed Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers  One of the first musicians he heard in person was Ernest Tubb playing on the back of a flatbed truck in Fort Worth  In west Texas  however  he was exposed to many forms of music   sepia —a euphemism for what became known as rhythm and blues  R&B   Tex Mex  orchestral Mantovani  and zydeco  The zydeco favorite  Joli Blon  was one of the first songs Orbison sang in public  At eight  Orbison began appearing on a local radio show  By the late 1940s  he was the host   In high school  Orbison and some friends formed The Wink Westerners  an informal band that played country standards and Glenn Miller songs at local honky tonks  and had a weekly radio show on KERB in Kermit  When they were offered $400 to play at a dance  Orbison realized that he could make a living in music  After graduating from Wink High School  he enrolled at North Texas State College in Denton  planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay  He formed another band called The Teen Kings and sang at night while working in the oil fields or studying during the day  Orbison saw classmate Pat Boone get signed for a record deal  further strengthening his resolve to become a professional musician  His geology grades dropping  he switched to Odessa Junior College to consider becoming a teacher   While living in Odessa  Orbison drove to Dallas to be shocked at the on stage antics of Elvis Presley  who was only a year older and a rising star in the music scene  Johnny Cash toured the area in 1955  playing on the same local radio show as the Teen Kings and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records  home of rockabilly stars including Presley  Carl Perkins  Jerry Lee Lewis and Cash  In their conversation  Phillips told Orbison curtly   Johnny Cash doesn t run my record company   but he was persuaded to listen to a song composed by Dick Penner and Wade Moore in mere minutes atop a fraternity house at North Texas State named  Ooby Dooby  that the Teen Kings had recorded on the Odessa based Je–Wel record label  Phillips was impressed and offered the Teen Kings a contract in 1956   2  1957–1959  Sun Records and Acuff Rose  The Teen Kings went to Memphis and although Orbison had grown weary of  Ooby Dooby   Phillips wanted to cut the record again in a better studio  Orbison rankled quietly at Phillips  dictating what the band would play and how Orbison was to sing it  However  with Phillips  production  the record broke into the Billboard Hot 100  peaking at number 59 and selling 200 000 copies  The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James  Johnny Horton  and Cash  Much influenced by Elvis Presley  Orbison performed frenetically  doing  everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record   The Teen Kings also began writing more material such as  Go  Go  Go   and  Rockhouse   generally in standard rockabilly style  The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties  but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16 year old girlfriend  Claudette Frady  to join him  They stayed in Phillips s home  where they slept in separate rooms  in the studio Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording  Sam Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison s mastery of the guitar than his voice  a ballad Orbison wrote called  The Clown  was met with lukewarm appreciation at best  Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison after hearing it that he would never make it as a ballad singer   He found a modicum of success at Sun Records and found his way into Elvis Presley s social circle  once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac  Orbison sold  Claudette   a song he wrote about Frady  whom he married in 1957  to The Everly Brothers and it appeared on the B side of their smash hit  All I Have to Do Is Dream   The first and perhaps only royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac  However  frustrated at Sun  Orbison gradually stopped recording  toured music circuits around Texas to make a living  and for seven months in 1958 quit performing completely  His car repossessed and in dire financial straits  he often depended on family and friends for funds   For a brief period in the late 1950s Orbison made his living at Acuff Rose  a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music  After spending an entire day writing a song  he would make several demo tapes at a time and send them to Wesley Rose  who would try to find the musical acts to record them  Orbison attempted to sell to RCA Victor songs he recorded that were written by other writers as well  working with and being completely in awe of Chet Atkins  who had played guitar with Presley  Orbison tried one song penned by Boudleaux Bryant called  Seems to Me   Bryant s impression of Orbison was of  a timid  shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene  I remember the way he sang then—softly  prettily but almost bashfully  as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him    Playing shows late into the night  and living with his wife and young child in his tiny apartment  Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there  Songwriter Joe Melson  an acquaintance of Orbison s  tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958 and the two decided to try to write some songs together  During three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959  Orbison and Melson recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville  with Atkins producing  but only two songs were judged worthy of release by RCA  Wesley Rose maneuvered Orbison into the sights of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records   3  1960–1964  Arrival and Monument Records  Orbison became one of the first recording artists to popularize the  Nashville sound   a trend of country and pop crossover music that used session musicians dubbed the A Team  guitarists Grady Martin  Harold Bradley  Ray Edenton and Bob Moore  pianists Floyd Cramer or Hargus  Pig  Robbins  drummer Buddy Harman  and backup vocals by The Jordanaires or the Anita Kerr Singers  The Nashville Sound was developed by producers Atkins  Owen Bradley—who worked closely with Patsy Cline—Sam Phillips  and Fred Foster  In his first session for Monument in Nashville  Orbison took on a song that RCA had refused   Paper Boy   backed by  With The Bug  as the B side  but neither charted   According to musician and author Albin Zak  the combination of the studio—engineered by Bill Porter  who experimented with close miking the doo wop backup singers—production by Foster  and accompanying musicians  gave Orbison s music a  polished  professional sound     finally allow ing  Orbison s stylistic inclinations free rein   In addition to the Nashville Sound s core components  Orbison requested strings in the studio  With this combination  Orbison recorded three new songs  the most notable of which was  Uptown   penned by him and Melson  Impressed with the results  Melson later recalled   We stood in the studio  listening to the playbacks and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world   The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll states that the music Orbison made in Nashville  brought a new splendor to rock   and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the music production of Phil Spector    Uptown  earned a modest spot at number 72 on the Billboard Top 100 and Orbison set his goal on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere  His initial success came as the careers of many of rock and roll s first generation had stalled or been derailed  Elvis Presley was in the army  Eddie Cochran and fellow Texan Buddy Holly—with both of whom Orbison had previously toured—had died  to Orbison s deep astonishment  Little Richard had found religion and Chuck Berry was in jail  Orbison s former Sun Records colleague Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced when his marriage to his 13 year old cousin was reported widely in the press  In their wake  pop music filled the radio waves  dominated by teen idol crooners who sang cleansed formulas like those about the twist dance craze and  death discs  like  Teen Angel  and  Endless Sleep    3 1  Writing for the voice  Influenced by contemporaneous hits such as  Come Back to Me  My Love   and  Come Softly to Me   Orbison and Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which  using elements from  Uptown  employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo wop backup singers  It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which  according to biographer Clayson   came not from his throat but deeper within   The song was  Only the Lonely   Orbison and Melson had earlier tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers but were turned down  They instead recorded the song at RCA s Nashville studio with Porter trying a completely new strategy  building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up  beginning with the close miked background vocals in the foreground and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background  This combination became Orbison s trademark sound  The single shot to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number 1 in the UK and Australia  According to Orbison  the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind  specifically to showcase its range and power  He told Rolling Stone in 1988   I liked the sound of  my voice   I liked making it sing  making the voice ring  and I just kept doing it  And I think that somewhere between the time of  Ooby Dooby  and  Only the Lonely   it kind of turned into a good voice    Instantly Orbison was in high demand  He appeared on American Bandstand and toured the U S  for three months non stop with Patsy Cline  When Presley heard  Only the Lonely  for the first time  he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends  Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex  Blue Angel  which peaked at U S  number 9 UK number 11   I m Hurtin    with  I Can t Stop Loving You  as B side  rose to number 27 but failed to chart in the UK   Orbison was now able to move his wife and son to Nashville full time  Back in the studio  seeking a change from the doowop styled pop sound of  Only the Lonely  and  I m Hurtin    Orbison worked on a new song   Running Scared   based loosely on the rhythm of Ravel s Boléro  the song was about a man on lookout for his girlfriend s previous boyfriend  who he feared would try to take her away  Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song s highest note without his voice breaking  He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice  Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks in an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice  Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes  but in the third  he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high A naturally  so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing  On that third take   Running Scared  was completed  Fred Foster later recalled   He did it  and everybody looked around in amazement  Nobody had heard anything like it before    3 2  Developing the image  Just weeks later  Running Scared  reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK  The composition of Orbison s following hits reflected  Running Scared   a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief  culminating with a surprise ending in a crescendo that employed Orbison s dynamic voice   Crying  followed in July 1961 and reached number 2  it was coupled with an R&B up tempo song titled  Candy Man  written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross  which reached the Billboard Top 30  staying on the charts for two months  While touring Australia in 1962  an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as  The Big O   partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads and the moniker stuck with him thereafter  Orbison s second son was born in 1962  and Orbison hit number 4 in the U S  and number 2 in the UK with  Dream Baby  How Long Must I Dream     an upbeat song written by country songwriter Cindy Walker  Orbison s producer would later form The Candymen quintet which functioned 1965 1970 as Orbison s backing band  while releasing a few singles and two albums of the their own  The rest of the year he charted with  The Crowd    Leah   and  Workin  For the Man   which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink  His relationship with Joe Melson  however  was deteriorating over Melson s growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground   Lacking the photogenic looks of many of his rock and roll contemporaries  Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality  He had no publicist in the early 1960s  no presence in fan magazines  and his single sleeves did not feature his picture  Life magazine called him an  anonymous celebrity   After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1962 or 1963  Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them  His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose  Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright  wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention  The ever present sunglasses led some people to assume  then and now  that the stationary performer was blind  The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion  Years later Orbison said   I wasn t trying to be weird  you know  I didn t have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything  But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse  although I never was  really    His dark and brooding persona  combined with his tremulous voice in lovelorn ballads marketed to teenagers  helped Orbison corner the pop market in the early 1960s  He had a string of hits in 1963 with  In Dreams   U S  number 7 UK number 6    Falling   U S  number 22 UK number 9    Mean Woman Blues   U S  number 5 UK number 3  coupled with  Blue Bayou   U S  number 29 UK number 3   He finished the year with a Christmas song written by Willie Nelson titled  Pretty Paper   U S  number 15 in 1963 UK number 6 in 1964    As  In Dreams  was released in April 1963  Orbison was asked to replace guitarist Duane Eddy on a tour of the UK in top billing  with the Beatles  whose popularity was on the rise  When he arrived in Britain  however  he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw  He had never heard of them and  annoyed  asked hypothetically   What s a Beatle anyway   to which John Lennon replied after tapping his shoulder   I am   On opening night  Orbison opted to go onstage first although he was the more established act  Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy  Lennon  Paul McCartney  George Harrison and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through fourteen encores  Finally  when the audience began chanting  We want Roy   again  Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back  Starr later said   In Glasgow  we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting  He was just standing there  not moving or anything   Through the tour  however  the two acts quickly learned to get along  a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work  Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon  but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship  The moniker of  The Big O  would eventually follow him back to the States  where it became an unofficial nickname for Orbison   3 3  Riding the success  Touring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison s personal life  His wife Claudette began having an affair with the contractor who built their home in Hendersonville  Tennessee  Their friends and relatives attributed it to her youth and that she was unable to withstand being alone and bored  when Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963  she joined him  He was immensely popular wherever he went  finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada  Almost immediately he toured Australia and New Zealand with the Beach Boys and returned again to Britain and Ireland  where he was so besieged by teenage girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him  He continued to tour  however  and visited Australia again  this time with the Rolling Stones  Mick Jagger later remarked of a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand   A fine figure of a man in the hot springs  he was    Orbison also began collaborating with Bill Dees  whom he had known in Texas  With Dees  he wrote  It s Over   a number 1 in the UK  and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career  When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville  Orbison asked if she had any money  Dees said   Pretty woman never needs any money   Forty minutes later   Oh  Pretty Woman  was completed  A riff laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie  the epithet Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note   Mercy     and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides  it rose to number 1 in the fall of 1964 in the U S  and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks  it hit number 1 in the UK as well  spending 18 weeks total on the charts  The single sold over seven million copies  Orbison s success was greater in Britain  as Billboard magazine noted   In a 68 week period that began on August 8  1963  Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number one single in Britain  He did it twice  with  It s Over  on June 25  1964  and  Oh  Pretty Woman  on October 8  1964  The latter song also went to number one in America  making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic    4  1965–1969  Success  career decline and personal tragedies   Oh  Pretty Woman  proved the pinnacle of Orbison s career in the 1960s  Following its release  he endured some upheavals  He and Claudette divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities  though they remarried in August 1965  Wesley Rose  at this time acting as Orbison s agent  moved him from Monument Records to Metro Goldwyn Mayer  MGM  though in the UK he remained with Decca s London Records  for a million dollars and the understanding that he would expand into television and films as Elvis Presley had done  Orbison was a film enthusiast  and when not touring  writing  or recording  would dedicate time to seeing up to three films a day  Rose also became Orbison s producer  Fred Foster later argued that Rose s takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison s work at MGM  engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison s best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville s A Team  Orbison s first collection at MGM  an album titled There Is Only One Roy Orbison  sold fewer than 200 000 copies  The British Invasion also occurred at the same time  changing the direction of rock music significantly   While on tour again in the UK in 1965  Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track and performed his show that evening in a cast  His reconciliation with Claudette occurred when she went to visit him while he was recuperating from the accident  Orbison was fascinated with machines  He was famous for following a car that he liked on sight and making the driver an offer on the spot  He had a collection worthy of a museum by the late 1960s  He and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles  she had grown up around them  but Orbison claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles  However  tragedy struck on June 6  1966  when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from Bristol  Tennessee  She was struck by a semi trailer truck and died instantly   A grieving Orbison threw himself into his work  collaborating with Bill Dees to write music for The Fastest Guitar Alive  a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well  It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy  Orbison s character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the American Civil War and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle  The prop allowed him to deliver the line  I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time   with—according to biographer Colin Escott— zero conviction   Orbison was pleased with the film  although it proved to be a critical and box office flop  While MGM had included five films in his contract  no more were made   He recorded an album dedicated to the songs of Don Gibson and another of Hank Williams covers  but both sold poorly  As the psychedelic rock movement took hold in the late 1960s  Orbison felt lost  later saying   I  didn t hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change  and you re still there and you bloom again   He continued to tour  and had previously made some smart real estate investments  so money was never an issue for him again  During a tour of the Midlands in England on September 16  1968  he received the news that his home in Hendersonville  Tennessee  had burned down and his two eldest sons had died  The property was sold to Johnny Cash  who planted an orchard on it  On March 25  1969  Orbison married German teenager Barbara Jakobs  whom he had met several days before his sons  deaths  His youngest son with Claudette  Wesley  born 1965  was raised by Orbison s parents  Orbison and Barbara had a son  Roy Kelton  in 1970 and another  Alexander  in 1974   5  Rediscovery  5 1  1970s–1980s  Singles  BBC broadcasting  live at the BBC  touring Britain  albums  duet with Emmylou Harris  covers and returning to Monument Records  Orbison recorded in the 1970s  but his albums performed so poorly that he began to doubt his talents  Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona   Since it was never clear where he had come from  no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone  he was just gone   His influence was apparent  however  as several artists released covers of his songs  which proved popular  Orbison s version of  Love Hurts   a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers  was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris  and again by heavy metal band Nazareth  Sonny James sent  Only the Lonely  to number 1 on the country music charts  Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of  Dream Baby   A compilation LP of Orbison s greatest hits went to number 1 in the UK in 1977  The same year he began to open concerts for the Eagles  who started as Linda Ronstadt s backup band  Ronstadt herself covered  Blue Bayou  in 1977  her version reaching number 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks  Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind  if not his career   In late 1977 Orbison started feeling unwell and decided to take a holiday to Hawaii to rest  however while there he was admitted to hospital and tests revealed three of his coronary arteries were severely clogged  On January 18  1978 Orbison underwent a triple coronary bypass  He had suffered from duodenal ulcers as early as 1960  and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence  Although he felt revitalized following the triple bypass  he continued to smoke and his weight fluctuated for the rest of his life  When Orbison felt strong enough to perform again  Scott Mathews took him into the recording studio and produced a version of  Oh  Pretty Woman  on a national radio and television advertising campaign for Tone Soap  a woman s beauty bar  This proved to be a much needed financial windfall for Orbison as Mathews saw to it that the company paid top dollar to license the use of Orbison s original composition and another large fee for Orbison s services   In 1980  Don McLean covered  Crying  in a version which hit number 5 in the U S  and stayed on the charts for 15 weeks  it was number 1 in the UK for three weeks  Although he was all but forgotten in the U S   Orbison took a chance and embarked on a tour of Bulgaria  He was astonished to find he was as popular there as he had been in 1964  he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of Sofia  Later that year  he and Emmylou Harris won a Grammy Award for their duet  That Lovin  You Feelin  Again   from the comedy film Roadie  in which Orbison also cameoed   It was his first such award  and he felt more than ever that the time was ripe for his full return to popular music  However  it would be several more years until this came to fruition   Van Halen released a hard rock cover of  Oh  Pretty Woman   titled   Oh  Pretty Woman   on their 1982 album Diver Down  again exposing a younger generation to Orbison s legacy   5 2  1987–1992  Singles  revival  a Black and White Night  the last concert  Mystery Girl  King of Hearts and duet with k d  lang  Orbison s career was fully revived in 1987  He released an album of his re recorded hits titled In Dreams  The Greatest Hits  A song he recorded named  Life Fades Away   written with friend Glenn Danzig  was featured in the film Less Than Zero  He and k d  lang performed a duet of  Crying  and released it on the soundtrack to Hiding Out  winning a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals   However  one film in which Orbison refused to allow his music was Blue Velvet  Director David Lynch asked to use  In Dreams  and Orbison turned him down  Lynch used it anyway  The song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth  Dennis Hopper   It was lip synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell  after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over  once beating the protagonist while the song played  During filming  Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere  Orbison was initially shocked at its use  he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said   I was mortified because they were talking about the  candy colored clown  in relation to a dope deal     I thought   What in the world       But later  when I was touring  we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song  and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to  In Dreams     The same year  Orbison was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen  who concluded his speech with a reference to his own song  Thunder Road    I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but  most of all  I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison  Now everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison   In response  Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech  and said of his induction that he felt  validated  by the honor  A few months later  Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom in Los Angeles  They were joined by Jackson Browne  T Bone Burnett  Elvis Costello  Tom Waits  Bonnie Raitt  Jennifer Warnes  James Burton and k d  lang  Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the show of support from so many talented and busy musicians   Roy looked at all of us and said   If there is anything I can ever do for you  please call on me   He was very serious  It was his way of thanking us  It was very emotional   The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title Roy Orbison and Friends  A Black and White Night  it was released on video by Virgin Records  selling 50 000 copies   5 3  1988  Traveling Wilburys and Mystery Girl  In 1987  Orbison had begun collaborating with Electric Light Orchestra frontman Jeff Lynne on a new album  At the same time Lynne was completing production work on George Harrison s Cloud Nine  and all three had lunch one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison s  They contacted Bob Dylan  who allowed them to use a recording studio in his home  Along the way  Harrison had to stop by Tom Petty s house to pick up his guitar  Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour  By that evening  the group had written  Handle with Care   which led to the concept of recording an entire album  They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys  representing themselves as half brothers from the same father  They gave themselves stage names  Orbison chose his from his musical hero  calling himself  Lefty Wilbury  after Lefty Frizzell  Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians  Orbison offered a quote about the group s foundation in honor   Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder  I remember him as a Baptist minister    Lynne later spoke of the recording sessions   Everybody just sat there going   Wow  it s Roy Orbison       E ven though he s become your pal and you re hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner  as soon as he gets behind that mike and he s doing his business  suddenly it s shudder time   Orbison was given one solo track on the album titled  Not Alone Anymore   His contributions were highly praised by the press  Traveling Wilburys Vol  1 spent 53 weeks on the U S  charts  peaking at number 3  It hit number 1 in Australia and topped out at number 16 in the UK  The LP won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group  Rolling Stone included it in the top 100 albums of the decade   Orbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again  and was thrilled about it  He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans to develop a solo album titled Mystery Girl   Mystery Girl was produced by Jeff Lynne  whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever worked with  while Elvis Costello  Orbison s son Wesley and others offered their songs to him  The biggest hit from the album was  You Got It   written by Lynne and Tom Petty  It posthumously rose to number 9 in the U S  and number 3 in the UK   Although the video for the Wilburys   Handle With Care  was filmed with Orbison  the video for  End of the Line  was filmed and released posthumously  During Orbison s vocal parts in  End of the Line   the video shows a guitar in a rocking chair  next to Orbison s framed photo   6  Death  While Orbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom  he reacted to his success in constant surprise  confessing  It s very nice to be wanted again  but I still can t quite believe it   He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring  as well as the newer demands of making videos  In November 1988  Mystery Girl was completed and Traveling Wilburys Vol  1 was rising up the charts  Around this time Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains and said he d have to have something done  but he never did  Orbison went to Europe where he was presented with an award and played a show in Antwerp where footage for the video for  You Got It  was filmed  He gave multiple interviews a day in a hectic schedule  A few days later a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill  but Orbison played the show to another standing ovation  Roy played at The Front Row Theater in Highland Heights  Ohio on December 4  which would be his last performance  Finally  exhausted  he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for a few days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys  On December 6  1988  he spent the day flying model airplanes with his sons  then  after having dinner at his mother s home in Hendersonville  Tennessee  he died of a heart attack at the age of 52   The tabloid National Enquirer suggested on its cover that Orbison had worked himself to death  A memorial was held in Nashville  and another in Los Angeles  he was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery  In January 1989  Orbison became the first musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the Top Five at the same time   7  Style and influence  Although Orbison is counted as a rock and roll pioneer  and has been cited by numerous critics as one of the genre s most influential musicians  his style was noted for how it departed from the norm  Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat  heavy guitars  and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion  However  very little of what Orbison recorded met these characteristics  The structure and themes of his songs defied convention  and his much praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll  Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians  although Orbison never mentioned any classical music influences  Author Peter Lehman summarized it  writing   He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth    Bassist Jerry Scheff  who backed Orbison in his A Black and White Night concert  wrote about him   Roy Orbison was like an opera singer  His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back  He never seemed like he was trying to sing  he just did it    7 1  Song structures  Music critic Dave Marsh also wrote that these compositions  define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music   Orbison s music  like the man himself  has been described as timeless  diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric  within a hair s breadth of being weird  New York Times writer Peter Watrous declared in a concert review   He has perfected an odd vision of popular music  one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity    In the 1960s  Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together  and insisted in recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together  The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs  Otherwise  each seems to follow a separate structure  Using the standard thirty two bar form for verses and choruses  normal pop songs followed the verse chorus verse chorus bridge verse chorus structure  Where A represents the first verse and B represents the chorus  most pop songs can be represented by A B A B C A B  like  Ooby Dooby  and  Claudette   Orbison s  In Dreams  was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro A B C D E F  no sections are repeated  In  Running Scared   however  the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax  to be represented as A A A A B   Crying  is more complex  changing parts toward the end to be represented as A B C D E F A B  C  D  E  F   Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before  Only the Lonely   he claimed never to have learned how to write them    I m sure we had to study composition or something like that at school  and they d say  This is the way you do it   and that s the way I would have done it  so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right  I went on my own way    So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song  and sometimes there is no chorus  it just goes   But that s always after the fact—as I m writing  it all sounds natural and in sequence to me   Elton John s songwriting partner Bernie Taupin wrote that Orbison s songs always made  radical left turns   and k d  lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised  such as how the entirety of  Running Scared  eventually depends on the final note  one word  Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do  Nashville session guitarist Jerry Kennedy stated   Roy went against the grain  The first time you d hear something  it wouldn t sound right  But after a few playbacks  it would start to grow on you    7 2  Themes of songs  Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison s ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss  and dreaming  A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as  Go  Go  Go   and  Mean Woman Blues  that are more thematically simple  addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio  In concert  Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim   In 1990  Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison s biography published in a CD box set   Orbison was the master of compression  Working the singles era  he could relate a short story  or establish a mood in under three minutes  If you think that s easy—try it  His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect  not a word or note surplus to intention   After attending a show in 1988  Peter Watrous of The New York Times wrote that Orbison s songs are  dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces   Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the  apocalyptic romanticism  in Orbison s music was well crafted for the films his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was  so over the top that dreams become delusions  and self pity paranoia   striking  a postmodern nerve   Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant favored American R&B music as a youth  but beyond the black musicians  he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience   The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning   Orbison  used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically    The loneliness in Orbison s songs that he became most famous for  he both explained and downplayed   I don t think I ve been any more lonely than anyone else     Although if you grow up in West Texas  there are a lot of ways to be lonely   His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture  Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated   He made emotion fashionable  that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things  For men to sing about very emotional things    Before that no one would do it   Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular   When   Crying   came out I don t think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry   Peter Lehman  on the other hand  considered Orbison s theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism   7 3  Voice quality  Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until  Only the Lonely  in 1960  when it was able  in his words  to allow its  flowering   Carl Perkins  however  toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard  Indian Love Call   and had the audience completely silenced  in awe  When compared to the Everly Brothers  who often used the same session musicians  Orbison is credited with  a passionate intensity  that  according to The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll  made  his love  his life  and  indeed  the whole world  seem  to be coming to an end—not with a whimper  but an agonized  beautiful bang    Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison s voice  Dwight Yoakam stated that Orbison s voice sounded like  the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window   Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees went further to say that when he heard  Crying  for the first time   That was it  To me that was the voice of God   Elvis Presley stated his voice was  respectively  the greatest and most distinctive they had ever heard   Bob Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence  remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s   With Roy  you didn t know if you were listening to mariachi or opera  He kept you on your toes  With him  it was all about fat and blood  He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop   After  Ooby Dooby    h e was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that made you want to drive your car over a cliff  He sang like a professional criminal      H is voice could jar a corpse  always leave you muttering to yourself something like   Man  I don t believe it   Likewise  Tim Goodwin  who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria  had been told that Orbison s voice would be a singular experience to hear  When Orbison started with  Crying  and hit the high notes  Goodwin stated   The strings were playing and the band had built up  and sure enough  the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up  It was an incredible physical sensation    Orbison s severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s  During the first few songs in a concert  the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable  but afterwards  it became stronger and more dependable  This also happened with age  Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings  and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible   7 4  Performance  Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage  although songs like  Mean Woman Blues  did offer that  He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented   I m not a super personality—on stage or off  I mean  you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second rate shows and they d still shine through  but not me  I d have to be prepared  People come to hear my music  my songs  That s what I have to give them    Lang compared Orbison to a tree  with passive but solid beauty  This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live  as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing  Oh  Pretty Woman   and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again  However  Lang quantified this style by saying   It s so hard to explain what Roy s energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word  Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet  He was just there    Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the U S  was mobilizing for World War II  His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather  and drink and sing heartily  Orbison later reflected   I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me  because it s still there  That sense of  do it for all it s worth and do it now and do it good   Not to analyze it too much  but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time    8  Discography  9  Honors  Grammys  Rock and
