World War II  WWII or WW2   also known as the Second World War  after the recent Great War   was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945  though related conflicts began earlier  It involved the vast majority of the world s nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances  the Allies and the Axis  It was the most widespread war in history  and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries  In a state of  total war   the major participants threw their entire economic  industrial and scientific capabilities behind the war effort  erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources  Marked by mass deaths of civilians  including the Holocaust  during which approximately 11 million people were killed  and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres  during which approximately one million people were killed  including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat   it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities  These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937  but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom  From late 1939 to early 1941  in a series of campaigns and treaties  Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe  and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan  Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact  Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours  including Poland  Finland and the Baltic states  The United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth were the only Allied forces continuing the fight against the Axis  with campaigns in North Africa and the Horn of Africa as well as the long running Battle of the Atlantic  In June 1941  the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union  opening the largest land theatre of war in history  which trapped the major part of the Axis  military forces into a War of Attrition  In December 1941  Japan attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean  and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific   The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway  near Hawaii  and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then  decisively  at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union  In 1943  with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front  the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender  and Allied victories in the Pacific  the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts  In 1944  the Western Allies invaded France  while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies  During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma  while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands   The war in Europe ended with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945  Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945  the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively  With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent  the possibility of additional atomic bombings  and the Soviet Union s declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria  Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945  Thus ended the war in Asia  and the final destruction of the Axis bloc   World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world  The United Nations  UN  was established to foster international co operation and prevent future conflicts  The victorious great powers—the United States  the Soviet Union  China  the United Kingdom  and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers  setting the stage for the Cold War  which lasted for the next 46 years  Meanwhile  the influence of European great powers waned  while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began  Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery  Political integration  especially in Europe  emerged as an effort to end pre war enmities and to create a common identity   1  Chronology  The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939  beginning with the German invasion of Poland  Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later  The dates for the beginning of war in the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino Japanese War on 7 July 1937  or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September 1931   Others follow the British historian A  J  P  Taylor  who held that the Sino Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941  This article uses the conventional dating  Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935  The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of the Second World War as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939   The exact date of the war s end is also not universally agreed upon  It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945  V J Day   rather than the formal surrender of Japan  2 September 1945   it is even claimed in some European histories that it ended on V E Day  8 May 1945   A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951 to formally tie up any loose ends such as compensation to be paid to Allied prisoners of war who had been victims of atrocities  A treaty regarding Germany s future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post World War II issues   2  Background  World War I had radically altered the political European map  with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria Hungary  Germany and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia  Meanwhile  existing victorious Allies such as France  Belgium  Italy  Greece and Romania gained territories  and new Nation states were created out of the collapse of Austria Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires   To prevent a future world war  the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference  The organisation s primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security  military and naval disarmament  and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration   Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I  its aftermath still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial  colonial  and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles  Under the treaty  Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas colonies  while German annexation of other states was prohibited  reparations were imposed  and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country s armed forces  In addition  the Russian Civil War had led to the creation of the Soviet Union   The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919  and a democratic government  later known as the Weimar Republic  was created  The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left  Italy  as an Entente ally  had made some post war territorial gains  however Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled with the peace settlement  From 1922 to 1925  the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist  totalitarian  and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy  repressed socialist  left wing and liberal forces  and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at forging Italy as a world power  promising the creation of a  New Roman Empire    In Germany  the Weimar Republic was attacked by right wing elements such as the Freikorps and the Nazi party  resulting in events such as the Kapp Putsch and the Beer Hall Putsch  With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929  domestic support for Nazism and its leader Adolf Hitler rose and  in 1933  he was appointed Chancellor of Germany  In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire  Hitler created a totalitarian single party state led by the Nazis   The Kuomintang  KMT  party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid 1920s  but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese communist allies  In 1931  an increasingly militaristic Japanese Empire  which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country s right to rule Asia  used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo   Too weak to resist Japan  China appealed to the League of Nations for help  Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria  The two nations then fought several battles  in Shanghai  Rehe and Hebei  until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933  Thereafter  Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria  and Chahar and Suiyuan   Adolf Hitler  after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923  eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933  He abolished democracy  espousing a radical  racially motivated revision of the world order  and soon began a massive rearmament campaign  It was at this time that multiple political scientists began to predict that a second Great War might take place  Meanwhile  France  to secure its alliance  allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia  which Italy desired as a colonial possession  The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles  accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription   Hoping to contain Germany  the United Kingdom  France and Italy formed the Stresa Front  however  in June 1935  the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany  easing prior restrictions  The Soviet Union  concerned due to Germany s goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe  wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France  Before taking effect though  the Franco Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations  which rendered it essentially toothless  The United States  concerned with events in Europe and Asia  passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year  Two months later  Italy invaded Ethiopia through Italian Somaliland and Eritrea  Germany was the only major European nation to support the invasion  Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany s goal of absorbing Austria   Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936  He received little response from other European powers  When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July  Hitler and Mussolini supported the fascist and authoritarian Nationalist forces in their civil war against the Soviet supported Spanish Republic  Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare  with the Nationalists winning the war in early 1939  In October 1936  Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis  A month later  Germany and Japan signed the Anti Comintern Pact  which Italy would join in the following year  In China  after the Xi an Incident  the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan   3  Pre war events  3 1  Italian invasion of Ethiopia  1935   The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936  The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire  also known as Abyssinia  by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy  Regno d Italia   which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea  The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa  Africa Orientale Italiana  or AOI   in addition  it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace  Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations  but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League s own Article X   3 2  Spanish Civil War  1936–39   During the Spanish Civil War  Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels  led by General Francisco Franco  The Soviet Union supported the existing government  the Spanish Republic  Over 30 000 foreign volunteers  known as the International Brigades  also fought against the Nationalists  Both Germany and the USSR used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics  The bombing of Guernica by the German Condor Legion in April 1937 heightened widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing attacks on civilians  The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939  Franco  now dictator  bargained with both sides during the Second World War  but never concluded any major agreements  He did send volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front under German command but Spain remained neutral and did not allow either side to use its territory   3 3  Japanese invasion of China  1937   In July 1937  Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Beijing after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident  which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China  The Soviets quickly signed a non aggression pact with China to lend materiel support  effectively ending China s prior co operation with Germany  Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai  but  after three months of fighting  Shanghai fell  The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back  capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937  After the fall of Nanking  tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese   In March 1938  Nationalist Chinese forces got their first major victory at Taierzhuang but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May  In June 1938  Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River  this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan  but the city was taken by October  Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve  instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war   3 4  Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union and Mongolia  1938   Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union  culminating in the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol  After this  Japan and the Soviet Union signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941  and Japan turned its focus to the South Pacific   3 5  European occupations and agreements  In Europe  Germany and Italy were becoming more bold  In March 1938  Germany annexed Austria  again provoking little response from other European powers  Encouraged  Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland  an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population  and soon Britain and France followed the counsel of prime minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement  which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government  in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands  Soon afterwards  Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland   Although all of Germany s stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement  privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation  In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish  war mongers  and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy  In March 1939  Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro German client state  the Slovak Republic  Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania  forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region   Alarmed  and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig  France and Britain guaranteed their support for Polish independence  when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939  the same guarantee was extended to Romania and Greece  Shortly after the Franco British pledge to Poland  Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel  Hitler accused Britain and Poland of trying to  encircle  Germany and renounced the Anglo German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non Aggression Pact   In August 1939  Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact  a non aggression treaty with a secret protocol  The parties gave each other rights to  spheres of influence   western Poland and Lithuania for Germany  eastern Poland  Finland  Estonia  Latvia and Bessarabia for the USSR   It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence  The agreement was crucial to Hitler because it assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two front war  as it had in World War I  after it defeated Poland   The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border  In a private meeting with the Italian foreign minister  Count Ciano  Hitler asserted that Poland was a  doubtful neutral  that needed to either yield to his demands or be  liquidated  to prevent it from drawing off German troops in the future  unavoidable  war with the Western democracies  He did not believe Britain or France would intervene in the conflict  On 23 August Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August  but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality  he decided to delay it  In response to British pleas for direct negotiations  Germany demanded on 29 August that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig and the Polish Corridor to Germany as well as to agree to safeguard the German minority in Poland  The Poles refused to comply with this request and on the evening of 31 August Germany declared that it considered its proposals rejected   4  Course of the war  4 1  War breaks out in Europe  1939–40   On 1 September 1939  Germany invaded Poland under the false pretext that the Poles had carried out a series of sabotage operations against German targets  Two days later  on 3 September  France and United Kingdom  followed by the fully independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth—Australia  3 September   Canada  10 September   New Zealand  3 September   and South Africa  6 September —declared war on Germany  However  initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland  consisting of a small French attack into the Saarland  The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany  which aimed to damage the country s economy and war effort  Germany responded by ordering U boat warfare against Allied merchant and war ships  which was to later escalate in the Battle of the Atlantic   On 17 September 1939  after signing a cease fire with Japan  the Soviets also invaded Poland from the east  The Polish army was defeated and Warsaw surrendered to the Germans on 27 September  with final pockets of resistance surrendering on 6 October  Poland s territory was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union  with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares  After the surrender of Poland s armed forces  Polish resistance established an Underground State  a partisan Home Army  and continued to fight alongside the Allies on all fronts in Europe and North Africa  throughout the entire course of the war   About 100 000 Polish military personnel were evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries  many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theatres of the war  Poland s Enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to France   On 6 October Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France  but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union  Chamberlain rejected this on 12 October  saying  Past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present German Government   After this rejection Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France  but bad weather forced repeated postponements until the spring of 1940   After signing the German Soviet treaty governing Lithuania  the Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries under pacts of  mutual assistance   Finland rejected territorial demands  prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939  The resulting Winter War ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions  The United Kingdom and France treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans  responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR s expulsion from the League of Nations   4 2  Western Europe  1940–41   In April 1940  Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden  which the Allies were attempting to cut off by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters  Denmark capitulated after a few hours  and despite Allied support  during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured by the British  Norway was conquered within two months  British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the replacement of the British Prime Minister  Neville Chamberlain  with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940   Germany launched an offensive against France and  for reasons of military strategy  also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium  the Netherlands  and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940  That same day the United Kingdom occupied the Danish possessions of Iceland  Greenland and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands  The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks  respectively  The French fortified Maginot Line and the main body the Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region  mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles  As a result  the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten  The majority were taken prisoner  whilst over 300 000  mostly British and French  were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early June  although abandoning almost all of their equipment   On 10 June  Italy invaded France  declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom  Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June and eight days later France surrendered and was soon divided into German and Italian occupation zones  and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime  which  though officially neutral  was generally aligned with Germany  France kept its fleet but the British feared the Germans would seize it  so on 3 July  the British attacked it   In June 1940  the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania  and then annexed the disputed Romanian region of Bessarabia  Meanwhile  Nazi Soviet political rapprochement and economic co operation gradually stalled  and both states began preparations for war   On 19 July  Hitler again publicly offered to end the war  saying he had no desire to destroy the British Empire  The United Kingdom rejected this  with Lord Halifax responding  there was in his speech no suggestion that peace must be based on justice  no word of recognition that the other nations of Europe had any right to self‑determination       Following this  Germany began an air superiority campaign over the United Kingdom  the Battle of Britain  to prepare for an invasion  The campaign failed  and the invasion plans were cancelled by September  Frustrated  and in part in response to repeated British air raids against Berlin  Germany began a strategic bombing offensive against British cities known as the Blitz  However  the air attacks largely failed to disrupt the British war effort   Using newly captured French ports  the German Navy enjoyed success against an over extended Royal Navy  using U boats against British shipping in the Atlantic  The British scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck  Perhaps most importantly  during the Battle of Britain the Royal Air Force had successfully resisted the Luftwaffe s assault  and the German bombing campaign largely ended in May 1941   Throughout this period  the neutral United States took measures to assist China and the Western Allies  In November 1939  the American Neutrality Act was amended to allow  cash and carry  purchases by the Allies  In 1940  following the German capture of Paris  the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased  In September  the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases  Still  a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941   Although Roosevelt had promised to keep the United States out of the war  he nevertheless took concrete steps to prepare for that eventuality  In December 1940 he accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out negotiations as useless  calling for the US to become an  arsenal for democracy  and promoted the passage of Lend Lease aid to support the British war effort  In January 1941 secret high level staff talks with the British began for the purposes of determining how to defeat Germany should the US enter the war  They decided on a number of offensive policies  including an air offensive  the  early elimination  of Italy  raids  support of resistance groups  and the capture of positions to launch an offensive against Germany   At the end of September 1940  the Tripartite Pact united Japan  Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers  The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country  with the exception of the Soviet Union  not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three  The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary  Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact  Romania would make a major contribution  as did Hungary  to the Axis war against the USSR  partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR  partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu s desire to combat communism   4 3  Mediterranean  1940–41   Italy began operations in the Mediterranean  initiating a siege of Malta in June  conquering British Somaliland in August  and making an incursion into British held Egypt in September 1940  In October 1940  Italy started the Greco Italian War due to Mussolini s jealousy of Hitler s success but within days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania  where a stalemate soon occurred  The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece  Hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a foothold in the Balkans  to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean  and to secure his hold on Romanian oil   In December 1940  British Commonwealth forces began counter offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa  The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner  The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats  with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto  and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan   The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy  Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February  and by the end of March they had launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece  In under a month  Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk  The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June  but failed on both occasions   By late March 1941  following Bulgaria s signing of the Tripartite Pact  the Germans were in position to intervene in Greece  Plans were changed  however  due to developments in neighbouring Yugoslavia  The Yugoslav government had signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March  only to be overthrown two days later by a British encouraged coup  Hitler viewed the new regime as hostile and immediately decided to eliminate it  On 6 April Germany simultaneously invaded both Yugoslavia and Greece  making rapid progress and forcing both nations to surrender within the month  The British were driven from the Balkans after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of May  Although the Axis victory was swift  bitter partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia  which continued until the end of the war   The Allies did have some successes during this time  In the Middle East  Commonwealth forces first quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy controlled Syria  then  with the assistance of the Free French  invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent further such occurrences   4 4  Axis attack on the USSR  1941   With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable  Germany  Japan  and the Soviet Union made preparations  With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource rich European possessions in Southeast Asia  the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941  By contrast  the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union  massing forces on the Soviet border   Hitler believed that Britain s refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later  He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany s relations with the Soviets  or failing that  to attack and eliminate them as a factor  In November 1940  negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact  The Soviets showed some interest  but asked for concessions from Finland  Bulgaria  Turkey  and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable  On 18 December 1940  Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union   On 22 June 1941  Germany  supported by Italy and Romania  invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa  with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them  They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary  The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region  Moscow and Ukraine  with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk Astrakhan line  from the Caspian to the White Seas  Hitler s objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power  exterminate Communism  generate Lebensraum   living space   by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany s remaining rivals   Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter offensives before the war  Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence  During the summer  the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory  inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel  By the middle of August  however  the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre  and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad  The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful  resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies  and made further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine  the First Battle of Kharkov  possible   The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy  In July  the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany The British and Soviets invaded Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran s oil fields  In August  the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter   By October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved  with only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing  A major offensive against Moscow was renewed  after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow  where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive  Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces  but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives  two key cities remained in Soviet hands  the Soviet capability to resist was not broken  and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential  The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended   By early December  freshly mobilised reserves allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops  This  as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army  allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops west   4 5  War breaks out in the Pacific  1941   In 1939 the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan and beginning with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940 Japan had become subject to increasing economic pressure  During this time  Japan launched its first attack against Changsha  a strategically important Chinese city  but was repulsed by late September  Despite several offensives by both sides  the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940  To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes  and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers  Japan had occupied northern Indochina  Afterwards  the United States embargoed iron  steel and mechanical parts against Japan  Other sanctions soon followed   In August of that year  Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China  in retaliation  Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists  Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941  effectively ending their co operation  In March  the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao  In September  Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces   German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia  The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies  but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941  In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina  thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East  The United States  United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo   Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China  During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate  At the same time the US  Britain  and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories  in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them  Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines  an American possession since 1898  and warned Japan that the US would react to Japanese attacks against any  neighboring countries    Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American British Dutch sanctions  Japan prepared for war  On 20 November it presented an interim proposal as its final offer  It called for the end of American aid to China and the supply of oil and other resources to Japan  In exchange they promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw their forces from their threatening positions in southern Indochina  The American counter proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non aggression pacts with all Pacific powers  That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China  or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force  the Japanese military did not consider the former an option  and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war   Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific  the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war  To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset  On 7 December  8 December in Asian time zones   1941  Japan attacked British and American holdings with near simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific  These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor  landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong   These attacks led the United States  Britain  China  Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan  whereas the Soviet Union  being heavily involved in large scale hostilities with European Axis countries  preferred to maintain its neutrality agreement with Japan  Germany  followed by the other Axis states  declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan  citing as justification the American attacks on German submarines and merchant ships that had been ordered by Roosevelt   4 6  Axis advance stalls  1942–43   In January 1942  the United States  Britain  Soviet Union  China  and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations  thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter  and agreeing to not to sign separate peace with the Axis powers   During 1942  Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue  All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective  The Americans favoured a straightforward  large scale attack on Germany through France  The Soviets were also demanding a second front  The British  on the other hand  argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to throw a  ring  around Germany which would wear out German strength  lead to increasing demoralisation  and bolster resistance forces  Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign  An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large scale armies  Eventually  the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa   At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943  the Allies issued a declaration declaring that they would not negotiate with their enemies and demanded their unconditional surrender  The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes  Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war  in May 1943  the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944   4 6 1  Pacific  1942–43   By the end of April 1942  Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma  Malaya  the Dutch East Indies  Singapore  and Rabaul  inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners  Despite stubborn resistance at Corregidor  the US possession of the Philippines was eventually captured in May 1942  forcing its government into exile  On 16 April  in Burma  7 000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division  Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea  Java Sea and Indian Ocean  and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin  Australia  The only real Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha in early January 1942  These easy victories over unprepared opponents left Japan overconfident  as well as overextended   In early May 1942  Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia  The Allies  however  prevented the invasion by intercepting and defeating the Japanese naval forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea  Japan s next plan  motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid  was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated  as a diversion  Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska  In early June  Japan put its operations into action but the Americans  having broken Japanese naval codes in late May  were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy   With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle  Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua  The Americans planned a counter attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands  primarily Guadalcanal  as a first step towards capturing Rabaul  the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia   Both plans started in July  but by mid September  the Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese  and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island  where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna Gona  Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal  By the start of 1943  the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops  In Burma  Commonwealth forces mounted two operations  The first  an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942  went disastrously  forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943  The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front lines in February which  by the end of April  had achieved mixed results   4 6 2  Eastern Front  1942–43   Despite considerable losses  in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia  keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year  In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkiv  and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942  to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe  while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front  The Germans split Army Group South into two groups  Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south east to the Caucasus  while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River  The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga   By mid November  the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting when the Soviets began their second winter counter offensive  starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow  though the latter failed disastrously  By early February 1943  the German Army had taken tremendous losses  German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender  and the front line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive  In mid February  after the Soviet push had tapered off  the Germans launched another attack on Kharkiv  creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk   4 6 3  Western Europe Atlantic & Mediterranean  1942–43   Exploiting poor American naval command decisions  the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast  By November 1941  Commonwealth forces had launched a counter offensive  Operation Crusader  in North Africa  and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made  In North Africa  the Germans launched an offensive in January  pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early February  followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives  Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942  An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein  On the Continent  raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets  culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid  demonstrated the Western Allies  inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation  equipment  and operational security   In August 1942  the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein and  at a high cost  managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta  A few months later  the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt  dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya  This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo American landings in French North Africa  which resulted in the region joining the Allies  Hitler responded to the French colony s defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France  although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice  they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces  The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia  which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943   In early 1943 the British and Americans began the  Combined Bomber Offensive   a strategic bombing campaign against Germany  The goals were to disrupt the German war economy  reduce German morale  and  de house  the German civilian population   4 7  Allies gain momentum  1943–44   Following the Guadalcanal Campaign  the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific  In May 1943  Allied forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians  and soon after began major operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands  and to breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands  By the end of March 1944  the Allies had completed both of these objectives  and additionally neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands  In April  the Allies then launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea   In the Soviet Union  both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 making preparations for large offensives in central Russia  On 4 July 1943  Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge  Within a week  German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets  deeply echeloned and well constructed defences and  for the first time in the war  Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success  This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies  invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which  combined with previous Italian failures  resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month  Also  in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40 000 people   On 12 July 1943  the Soviets launched their own counter offensives  thereby dispelling any hopes of the German Army for victory or even stalemate in the east  The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority  giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front  The Germans attempted to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther Wotan line  however  the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensives   On 3 September 1943  the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland  following an Italian armistice with the Allies  Germany responded by disarming Italian forces  seizing military control of Italian areas  and creating a series of defensive lines  German special forces then rescued Mussolini  who then soon established a new client state in German occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic  causing an Italian civil war  The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid November   German operations in the Atlantic also suffered  By May 1943  as Allied counter measures became increasingly effective  the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign  In November 1943  Franklin D  Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran  The former conference determined the post war return of Japanese territory  while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany s defeat   From November 1943  during the seven week Battle of Changde  the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition  while awaiting Allied relief  In January 1944  the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and attempted to outflank it with landings at Anzio  By the end of January  a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region  ending the longest and most lethal siege in history   The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re establish national independence  This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region  By late May 1944  the Soviets had liberated Crimea  largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine  and made incursions into Romania  which were repulsed by the Axis troops  The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and  at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat  on 4 June  Rome was captured   The Allies experienced mixed fortunes in mainland Asia  In March 1944  the Japanese launched the first of two invasions  an operation against British positions in Assam  India  and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima  In May 1944  British forces mounted a counter offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma  and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina  The second Japanese invasion of China attempted to destroy China s main fighting forces  secure railways between Japanese held territory and capture Allied airfields  By June  the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a renewed attack against Changsha in the Hunan province   4 8  Allies close in  1944   On 6 June 1944  known as D Day   after three years of Soviet pressure  the Western Allies invaded northern France  After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy  they also attacked southern France  These landings were successful  and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France  Paris was liberated by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces  both led by General Charles de Gaulle  on 25 August and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year  An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands ended with a failure  After that  the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany  unsuccessfully trying to cross the Rur river in a large offensive  In Italy the Allied advance also slowed down  when they ran into the last major German defensive line   On 22 June  the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus  known as  Operation Bagration   that resulted in the almost complete destruction of the German Army Group Centre  Soon after that  another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland  The successful advance of Soviet troops prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings  Though  the largest of these in Warsaw  where German soldiers massacred 200 000 civilians  as well as a national Slovak Uprising in the south did not receive Soviet support  and were put down by German forces  The Red Army s strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d état in Romania and in Bulgaria  followed by those countries  shift to the Allied side   In September 1944  Soviet Red Army troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of the German Army Groups E and F in Greece  Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off  By this point  the Communist led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito  who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941  controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and were engaged in delaying efforts against the German forces further south  In northern Serbia  the Red Army  with limited support from Bulgarian forces  assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October  A few days later  the Soviets launched a massive assault against German occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945  In contrast with impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans  the bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to the signing of Soviet Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions  with a subsequent shift to the Allied side by Finland   By the start of July  Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam  pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina  In China  the Japanese were having greater successes  having finally captured Changsha in mid June and the city of Hengyang by early August  Soon after  they further invaded the province of Guangxi  winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by the middle of December   In the Pacific  American forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter  In mid June 1944 they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands  and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea  These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister  Hideki Tojo  and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands  In late October  American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte  soon after  Allied naval forces scored another large victory during the Battle of Leyte Gulf  one of the largest naval battles in history   4 9  Axis collapse  Allied victory  1944–45   On 16 December 1944  Germany attempted its last desperate measure for success on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter offensive in the Ardennes to attempt to split the Western Allies  encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement  By January  the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled  In Italy  the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line  In mid January 1945  the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland  pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany  and overran East Prussia  On 4 February  US  British  and Soviet leaders met for the Yalta Conference  They agreed on the occupation of post war Germany  and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan   In February  the Soviets invaded Silesia and Pomerania  while Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river  By March  the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr  encircling the German Army Group B  while the Soviets advanced to Vienna  In early April  the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany  while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April  The American and Soviet forces linked up on Elbe river on 25 April  On 30 April 1945  the Reichstag was captured  signalling the military defeat of the Third Reich   Several changes in leadership occurred during this period  On 12 April  President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry Truman  Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April  Two days later  Hitler committed suicide  and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz   German forces surrendered in Italy on 29 April  Total and unconditional surrender was signed on 7 May  to be effective by the end of 8 May  German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May   In the Pacific theatre  American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines  clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945  They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and captured Manila in March following a battle which reduced the city to ruins  Fighting continued on Luzon  Mindanao  and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war  On the night of 9–10 March  B 29 bombers of the US Army Air Forces struck Tokyo with incendiary bombs  which killed 100 000 people within a few hours  Over the next five months  American bombers firebombed 66 other Japanese cities  causing the destruction of untold numbers of buildings and the deaths of between 350 000–500 000 Japanese civilians   In May 1945  Australian troops landed in Borneo  over running the oilfields there  British  American  and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March  and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May  Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945  American forces also moved towards Japan  taking Iwo Jima by March  and Okinawa by the end of June  At the same time American bombers were destroying Japanese cities  American submarines cut off Japanese imports  drastically reducing Japan s ability to supply its overseas forces   On 11 July  Allied leaders met in Potsdam  Germany  They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany  and reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of all Japanese forces by Japan  specifically stating that  the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction   During this conference  the United Kingdom held its general election  and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister   As Japan continued to ignore the Potsdam terms issued to them on 27 July  the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August  Like the Japanese cities previously bombed by American airmen  the US and its allies justified the atomic bombings as military necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250 000–500 000 Allied troops and millions of Japanese troops and civilians  Between the two bombings  the Soviets  pursuant to the Yalta agreement  invaded Japanese held Manchuria  and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army  which was the largest Japanese fighting force  The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands  On 15 August 1945  Japan surrendered  with the surrender documents finally signed aboard the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945  ending the war   5  Aftermath  The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany  The former became a neutral state  non aligned with any political bloc  The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR  accordingly  A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the removal of ex Nazis from power  although this policy moved towards amnesty and re integration of ex Nazis into West German society   Germany lost a quarter of its pre war  1937  territory  Among the eastern territories  Silesia  Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland  East Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR  followed by the expulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces  as well as the expulsion of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to Germany  By the 1950s  every fifth West German was a refugee from the east  The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line  from which 2 million Poles were expelled  north east Romania  parts of eastern Finland  and the three Baltic states were also incorporated into the USSR   In an effort to maintain peace  the Allies formed the United Nations  which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945  and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948  as a common standard for all member nations  The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States  Soviet Union  China  Britain  and France—formed the permanent members of the UN s Security Council  The five permanent members remain so to the present  although there have been two seat changes  between the Republic of China and the People s Republic of China in 1971  and between the Soviet Union and its successor state  the Russian Federation  following the dissolution of the Soviet Union  The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over   Germany had been de facto divided  and two independent states  the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones  accordingly  The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence  Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere  which led to establishment of Communist led regimes  with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities  As a result  Poland  Hungary  East Germany  Czechoslovakia  Romania  and Albania became Soviet satellite states  Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy  causing tension with the USSR   Post war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances  the United States led NATO and the Soviet led Warsaw Pact  the long period of political tensions and military competition between them  the Cold War  would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars   In Asia  the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated Japan s former islands in the Western Pacific  while the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands  Korea  formerly under Japanese rule  was divided and occupied by the US in the South and the Soviet Union in the North between 1945 and 1948  Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948  each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea  which led ultimately to the Korean War   In China  nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946  Communist forces were victorious and established the People s Republic of China on the mainland  while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949  In the Middle East  the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab Israeli conflict  While European colonial powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires  their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful  leading to decolonisation   The global economy suffered heavily from the war  although participating nations were affected differently  The US emerged much richer than any other nation  it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy  The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945–1948  Due to international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years   Recovery began with the mid 1948 currency reform in Western Germany  and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan  1948–1951  both directly and indirectly caused  The post 1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle  Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded  By contrast  the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin  and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance  more than any other European country  continued relative economic decline for decades   The Soviet Union  despite enormous human and material losses  also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post war era  Japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth  becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s  China returned to its pre war industrial production by 1952   6  Impact  6 1  Casualties and war crimes  Estimates for the total casualties of the war vary  because many deaths went unrecorded  Most suggest that some 75 million people died in the war  including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians  Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide  massacres  mass bombing  disease  and starvation   The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war  including 8 7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths  The largest portion of military dead were 5 7 million ethnic Russians  followed by 1 3 million ethnic Ukrainians  A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed  Germany sustained 5 3 million military losses  mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany   Of the total deaths in World War II  approximately 85 percent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the Allied side and 15 percent on the Axis side  Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and Japanese forces in occupied territories  An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died as a direct or indirect result of Nazi ideological policies  including the systematic genocide of around 6 million Jews during the Holocaust  along with a further 5 to 6 million ethnic Poles and other Slavs  including Ukrainians and Belarusians —Roma  homosexuals  and other ethnic and minority groups   Roughly 7 5 million civilians died in China under Japanese occupation  Hundreds of thousands  varying estimates  of ethnic Serbs  along with gypsies and Jews  were murdered by the Axis aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia  with retribution related killings of Croatian civilians just after the war ended   The best known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre  in which several hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered  Between 3 million to more than 10 million civilians  mostly Chinese  were killed by the Japanese occupation forces  Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported 2 7 million casualties occurred during the Sankō Sakusen  General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung   Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons  The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during their invasion and occupation of China  see Unit 731  and in early conflicts against the Soviets  Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against civilians and  sometimes on prisoners of war   The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22 000 Polish officers  and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD  in the Baltic states  and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army   The mass bombing of civilian areas  notably the cities of Warsaw  Rotterdam and London  including the aerial targeting of hospitals and fleeing refugees by the German Luftwaffe  along with the bombing of Tokyo  and German cities of Dresden  Hamburg and Cologne by the Western Allies may be considered as war crimes  The latter resulted in the destruction of more than 160 cities and the deaths of more than 600 000 German civilians  However  no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II   6 2  Concentration camps  slave labour  and genocide  The German Government led by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was responsible for the Holocaust  the killing of approximately 6 million Jews  overwhelmingly Ashkenazim   as well as 2 7 million ethnic Poles  and 4 million others who were deemed  unworthy of life   including the disabled and mentally ill  Soviet prisoners of war  homosexuals  Freemasons  Jehovah s Witnesses  and Romani  as part of a programme of deliberate extermination  About 12 million  most of whom were Eastern Europeans  were employed in the German war economy as forced labourers   In addition to Nazi concentration camps  the Soviet gulags  labour camps  led to the death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland  Lithuania  Latvia  and Estonia  as well as German prisoners of war  POWs  and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis  Sixty percent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war  Richard Overy gives the number of 5 7 million Soviet POWs  Of those  57 percent died or were killed  a total of 3 6 million  Soviet ex POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators  and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD   Japanese prisoner of war camps  many of which were used as labour camps  also had high death rates  The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 1 percent  for American POWs  37 percent   seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians  While 37 583 prisoners from the UK  28 500 from the Netherlands  and 14 473 from United States were released after the surrender of Japan  the number for the Chinese was only 56   According to historian Zhifen Ju  at least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board  or Kōain  for work in mines and war industries  After 1942  the number reached 10 million  The US Library of Congress estimates that in Java  between 4 and 10 million romusha  Japanese   manual laborers    were forced to work by the Japanese military  About 270 000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese held areas in South East Asia  and only 52 000 were repatriated to Java   On 19 February 1942  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066  interning about 100 000 Japanese living on the West Coast  Canada had a similar program  In addition  14 000 German and Italian citizens who had been assessed as being security risks were also interned   In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the Yalta Conference millions of POWs and civilians were used as forced labour by the Soviet Union  In Hungary s case  Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until 1955   6 3  Occupation  In Europe  occupation came under two forms  In Western  Northern and Central Europe  France  Norway  Denmark  the Low Countries  and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia  Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69 5 billion reichmarks  27 8 billion US Dollars  by the end of the war  this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products  military equipment  raw materials and other goods  Thus  the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation  a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on   In the East  the much hoped for bounties of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders  Unlike in the West  the Nazi racial policy encouraged excessive brutality against what it considered to be the  inferior people  of Slavic descent  most German advances were thus followed by mass executions  Although resistance groups did form in most occupied territories  they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943   In Asia  Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere  essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples  Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories  their excessive brutality turned local public opinions against them within weeks  During Japan s initial conquest it captured of oil  ~5 5×105 tonnes  left behind by retreating Allied forces  and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to   76 percent of its 1940 output rate   6 4  Home fronts and production  In Europe  before the outbreak of the war  the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics  In 1938  the Western Allies  United Kingdom  France  Poland and British Dominions  had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis  Germany and Italy   if colonies are included  it then gives the Allies more than a 5 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 1 advantage in GDP  In Asia at the same time  China had roughly six times the population of Japan  but only an 89 percent higher GDP  this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included   Though the Allies  economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan  they became the decisive factor by 1942  after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies  as the war largely settled into one of attrition  While the Allies  ability to out produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources  other factors  such as Germany and Japan s reluctance to employ women in the labour force  Allied strategic bombing  and Germany s late shift to a war economy contributed significantly  Additionally  neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war  and were not equipped to do so  To improve their production  Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers  Germany used about 12 million people  mostly from Eastern Europe  while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia   6 5  Advances in technology and warfare  Aircraft were used for reconnaissance  as fighters  bombers  and ground support  and each role was advanced considerably  Innovation included airlift  the capability to quickly move limited high priority supplies  equipment  and personnel   and of strategic bombing  the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy s ability to wage war   Anti aircraft weaponry also advanced  including defences such as radar and surface to air artillery  such as the German 88 mm gun  The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and  though late introduction meant it had little impact  it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide   Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare  most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines  Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war  actions at Taranto  Pearl Harbor  and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship   In the Atlantic  escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys  increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid Atlantic gap  Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured  Submarines  which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War  were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second  The British focused development on anti submarine weaponry and tactics  such as sonar and convoys  while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability  with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics  Gradually  improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light  hedgehog  squid  and homing torpedoes proved victorious   Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War I to increased mobility and combined arms  The tank  which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War  had evolved into the primary weapon  In the late 1930s  tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I  and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed  armour and firepower   At the start of the war  most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications  This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour  and German doctrine of avoiding tank versus tank combat  This  along with Germany s use of combined arms  were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France  Many means of destroying tanks  including indirect artillery  anti tank guns  both towed and self propelled   mines  short ranged infantry antitank weapons  and other tanks were utilised  Even with large scale mechanisation  infantry remained the backbone of all forces  and throughout the war  most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I   The portable machine gun spread  a notable example being the German MG34  and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings  The assault rifle  a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun  became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces   Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines  the most well known being the German Enigma machine  Development of SIGINT  signals intelligence  and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption  Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra  a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau  which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war  Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception  which the Allies used to great effect  such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard  Other technological and engineering feats achieved during  or as a result of  the war include the world s first programmable computers  Z3  Colossus  and ENIAC   guided missiles and modern rockets  the Manhattan Project s development of nuclear weapons  operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines
