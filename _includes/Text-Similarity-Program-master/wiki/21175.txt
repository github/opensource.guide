Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7  It is the lightest pnictogen and at room temperature  it is a colorless and odorless diatomic gas  Nitrogen is a common element in the universe  estimated at about seventh in total abundance in our galaxy and the Solar System  On Earth  the element forms about 78% of Earth s atmosphere and as such is the most abundant pure element  The element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air  by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford  in 1772   Many industrially important compounds  such as ammonia  nitric acid  organic nitrates  propellants and explosives   and cyanides  contain nitrogen  The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen  N≡N  dominates nitrogen chemistry  causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting the N2 into useful compounds  but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn  explode  or decay back into nitrogen gas  Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilizers and fertilizer nitrates are key pollutants in causing the eutrophication of water systems   Outside their major uses as fertilizers and energy stores  nitrogen compounds are versatile organics  Nitrogen is part of materials as diverse as Kevlar fabric and cyanoacrylate  super  glue  Nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major pharmacological drug class  including antibiotics  Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen containing signal molecules  for example  the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by being metabolized to natural nitric oxide  Plant alkaloids  often defense chemicals  contain nitrogen by definition  and thus many notable nitrogen containing drugs  such as caffeine and morphine are either alkaloids or synthetic mimics that act  as many plant alkaloids do  upon receptors of animal neurotransmitters  for example  synthetic amphetamines    Nitrogen occurs in all organisms  primarily in amino acids  and thus proteins  and also in the nucleic acids  DNA and RNA   The human body contains about 3% by mass of nitrogen  the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen  carbon  and hydrogen  The nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air  into the biosphere and organic compounds  then back into the atmosphere   1  History and etymology  Nitrogen is formally considered to have been discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772  who called it noxious air  Though he did not recognize it as an entirely different chemical substance  he clearly distinguished it from  fixed air   The fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to Rutherford  Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele  Henry Cavendish  and Joseph Priestley  who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air  Nitrogen gas was inert enough that Antoine Lavoisier referred to it as  mephitic air  or azote  from the Greek word azotos   lifeless   In it  animals died and flames were extinguished  This  mephitic air  consisted mostly of N2  but might also have included more than 1% argon   Lavoisier s name for nitrogen is used in many languages  French  Italian  Polish  Russian  Albanian  Turkish  etc   and still remains in English in the common names of many compounds  such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion  The English word nitrogen  1794  entered the language from the French nitrogène  coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean Antoine Chaptal  1756–1832   from the Greek νίτρον nitron   sodium carbonate  and the French  gène   producing  from Greek  γενής  genes   producer  begetter   The gas had been found in nitric acid  Chaptal s meaning was that nitrogen gas is the essential part of nitric acid  in turn formed from saltpetre  potassium nitrate   then known as nitre  This word in the more ancient world originally described sodium salts that did not contain nitrate  and is a cognate of natron   Nitrogen compounds were well known by the Middle Ages  Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis  strong water   The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia  royal water   celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold  the king of metals   The earliest military  industrial  and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpetre  sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate   most notably in gunpowder  and later as fertilizer  In 1910  Lord Rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced  active nitrogen   a monoatomic allotrope of nitrogen  The  whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light  produced by his apparatus reacted with quicksilver to produce explosive mercury nitride   For a long time sources of nitrogen compounds were limited  Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions  Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process  1895–1899  and Haber–Bosch process  1908–1913  eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds  to the extent that half of global food production  see applications  now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers  At the same time  use of the Ostwald process  1902  to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large scale industrial production of nitrates which fueled explosives in the world wars of the 20th century   2  Production  Nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air  or by mechanical means using gaseous air  i e   pressurized reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption   Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes  When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN  oxygen free nitrogen    In a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite   Small amounts of impurities NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction  The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate  Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide   3  Properties  Nitrogen is a nonmetal  with an electronegativity of 3 04  It has five electrons in its outer shell and is  therefore  trivalent in most compounds  The triple bond in molecular nitrogen    is one of the strongest  The resulting difficulty of converting into other compounds  and the ease  and associated high energy release  of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental   have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities   At atmospheric pressure  molecular nitrogen condenses  liquefies  at 77 K  −195 79 °C  and freezes at 63 K  −210 01 °C  into the beta hexagonal close packed crystal allotropic form  Below 35 4 K  −237 6 °C  nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form  called the alpha phase   Liquid nitrogen  a fluid resembling water in appearance  but with 80 8% of the density  the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0 808 g mL   is a common cryogen   Unstable allotropes of nitrogen consisting of more than two nitrogen atoms have been produced in the laboratory  like and   Under extremely high pressures  1 1 million atm  and high temperatures  2000 K   as produced using a diamond anvil cell  nitrogen polymerizes into the single bonded cubic gauche crystal structure  This structure is similar to that of diamond  and both have extremely strong covalent bonds  is nicknamed  nitrogen diamond    Other  as yet unsynthesized  allotropes include hexazine    a benzene analog  and octaazacubane    a cubane analog   The former is predicted to be highly unstable  while the latter is predicted to be kinetically stable  for reasons of orbital symmetry   3 1  Isotopes  There are two stable isotopes of nitrogen  14N and 15N  By far the most common is 14N  99 634%   which is produced in the CNO cycle in stars  Of the ten isotopes produced synthetically  13N has a half life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half lives on the order of seconds or less   Biologically mediated reactions  e g   assimilation  nitrification  and denitrification  strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil  These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product   A small part  0 73%  of the molecular nitrogen in Earth s atmosphere is the isotopologue 14N15N  and almost all the rest is 14N2   The radioisotope 16N is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurized water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation  It is produced from 16O  in water  via  n p  reaction  It has a short half life of about 7 1 s  but during its decay back to 16O produces high energy gamma radiation  5 to 7 MeV    Because of this  the access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurized water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation  16N is one of the main means used to immediately detect even small leaks from the primary coolant to the secondary steam cycle   In similar fashion  access to any of the steam cycle components in a boiling water reactor nuclear power plant must be restricted during operation  Condensate from the condenser is typically retained for 10 minutes to allow for decay of the 16N  This eliminates the need to shield and restrict access to any of the feed water piping or pumps   3 2  Electromagnetic spectrum  Molecular nitrogen  14N2  is largely transparent to infrared and visible radiation because it is a homonuclear molecule and  thus  has no dipole moment to couple to electromagnetic radiation at these wavelengths  Significant absorption occurs at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths  beginning around 100 nanometers  This is associated with electronic transitions in the molecule to states in which charge is not distributed evenly between nitrogen atoms  Nitrogen absorption leads to significant absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the Earth s upper atmosphere and the atmospheres of other planetary bodies  For similar reasons  pure molecular nitrogen lasers typically emit light in the ultraviolet range   Nitrogen also makes a contribution to visible air glow from the Earth s upper atmosphere  through electron impact excitation followed by emission  This visible blue air glow  seen in the polar aurora and in the re entry glow of returning spacecraft  typically results not from molecular nitrogen but rather from free nitrogen atoms combining with oxygen to form nitric oxide  NO    Nitrogen gas also exhibits scintillation   3 3  Reactions  In general  nitrogen is unreactive at standard temperature and pressure  N2 reacts spontaneously with few reagents  being resilient to acids and bases as well as oxidants and most reductants  When nitrogen reacts spontaneously with a reagent  the net transformation is often called nitrogen fixation   Nitrogen reacts with elemental lithium  Lithium burns in an atmosphere of N2 to give lithium nitride   Magnesium also burns in nitrogen  forming magnesium nitride   N2 forms a variety of adducts with transition metals  The first example of a dinitrogen complex is  Ru NH3 5 N2  2+  see figure at right   However  it is interesting to note that the N2 ligand was obtained by the decomposition of hydrazine  and not coordination of free dinitrogen  Such compounds are now numerous  other examples include IrCl N2  PPh3 2  W N2 2 Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2 2  and   η5 C5Me4H 2Zr 2 μ2  η2 η2 N2   These complexes illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal s  in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process  A catalytic process to reduce N2 to ammonia with the use of a molybdenum complex in the presence of a proton source was published in 2005   The beginning point for industrial production of nitrogen compounds is the Haber process  in which nitrogen is fixed by reacting and over an iron II  III  oxide    catalyst at about 500 °C and 200 atmospheres pressure  Biological nitrogen fixation in free living cyanobacteria and in the root nodules of plants also produces ammonia from molecular nitrogen  The reaction  which is the source of the bulk of nitrogen in the biosphere  is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme complex that contains Fe and Mo atoms  using energy derived from hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate  ATP  into adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate  −20 5 kJ mol    4  Occurrence  Nitrogen gas  N2  is the largest constituent of the Earth s atmosphere  78 082% by volume of dry air  75 3% by weight in dry air   However  this high concentration does not reflect nitrogen s overall low abundance in the makeup of the Earth  from which most of the element escaped by solar evaporation  early in the planet s formation   Nitrogen is a common element in the universe  and is estimated to be approximately the seventh most abundant chemical element by mass in the universe  our galaxy and the Solar System  In these places it was originally created by fusion processes from carbon and hydrogen in supernovas  Molecular nitrogen and nitrogen compounds have been detected in interstellar space by astronomers using the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer   Due to the volatility of elemental nitrogen and also its common compounds with hydrogen and oxygen  nitrogen and its compounds were driven out of the planetesimals in the early Solar System by the heat of the Sun  and in the form of gases  were lost to the rocky planets of the inner Solar System  Nitrogen is therefore a relatively rare element on these inner planets  including Earth  as a whole  In this  nitrogen resembles neon  which has a similar high abundance in the universe  but is also rare in the inner Solar System  Nitrogen is estimated at 30th of the elements in crustal abundance  There exist some relatively uncommon nitrogen minerals  such as saltpetre  potassium nitrate   Chile saltpetre  sodium nitrate  and sal ammoniac  ammonium chloride   Even these are known mainly as concentrated from evaporative ocean beds  due to their ready solubility of most naturally occurring nitrogen compounds in water  A similar pattern occurs with the water solubility of the uncommon light element boron   However  nitrogen and its compounds occur far more commonly as gases in the atmospheres of planets and moons that are large enough to have atmospheres  For example  molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of not only Earth s atmosphere  but also the Saturnian moon Titan s thick atmosphere  Also  due to retention by gravity at colder temperatures  nitrogen and its compounds occur in trace to appreciable amounts in planetary atmospheres of the gas giant planets   Nitrogen is present in all known living organisms  in proteins  nucleic acids  and other molecules  It typically makes up around 4% of the dry weight of plant matter  and around 3% of the weight of the human body  It is a large component of animal waste  for example  guano   usually in the form of urea  uric acid  ammonium compounds  and derivatives of these nitrogenous products  which are essential nutrients for all plants that cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen   5  Compounds  The main neutral hydride of nitrogen is ammonia     although hydrazine    is also commonly used  Ammonia is more basic than water by 6 orders of magnitude  In solution ammonia forms the ammonium ion     Liquid ammonia  boiling point 240 K  is amphiprotic  displaying either Brønsted–Lowry acidic or basic character  and forms ammonium and the less common amide ions     both amides and nitride    salts are known  but decompose in water  Singly  doubly  triply and quadruply substituted alkyl compounds of ammonia are called amines  four substitutions  to form commercially and biologically important quaternary amines  results in a positively charged nitrogen  and thus a water soluble  or at least amphiphilic  compound   Larger chains  rings and structures of nitrogen hydrides are also known  but are generally unstable   Other classes of nitrogen anions  negatively charged ions  are the poisonous azides     which are linear and isoelectronic to carbon dioxide  but which bind to important iron containing enzymes in the body in a manner more resembling cyanide  Another molecule of the same structure is the colorless and relatively inert anesthetic gas Nitrous oxide  dinitrogen monoxide     also known as laughing gas  This is one of a variety of nitrogen oxides that form a family often abbreviated as NOx  Nitric oxide  nitrogen monoxide  NO   is a natural free radical used in signal transduction in both plants and animals  for example  in vasodilation by causing the smooth muscle of blood vessels to relax  The reddish and poisonous nitrogen dioxide contains an unpaired electron and is an important component of smog  Nitrogen molecules containing unpaired electrons show a tendency to dimerize  thus pairing the electrons   and are  in general  highly reactive  The corresponding acids are nitrous and nitric acid   with the corresponding salts called nitrites and nitrates   The higher oxides dinitrogen trioxide   dinitrogen tetroxide and dinitrogen pentoxide   are unstable and explosive  a consequence of the chemical stability of   Nearly every hypergolic rocket engine uses as the oxidizer  their fuels  various forms of hydrazine  are also nitrogen compounds  These engines are extensively used on spacecraft such as the space shuttle and those of the Apollo Program because their propellants are liquids at room temperature and ignition occurs on contact without an ignition system  allowing many precisely controlled burns  Some launch vehicles such as the Titan II and Ariane 1 through 4 also use hypergolic fuels  although the trend is away from such engines for cost and safety reasons  is an intermediate in the manufacture of nitric acid   a strong acid and a fairly strong oxidizing agent   Nitrogen is notable for the range of explosively unstable compounds that it can produce  Nitrogen triiodide is an extremely sensitive contact explosive  Nitrocellulose  produced by nitration of cellulose with nitric acid  is also known as guncotton  Nitroglycerin  made by nitration of glycerin  is the dangerously unstable explosive ingredient of dynamite  The comparatively stable  but less powerful explosive trinitrotoluene  TNT  is the standard explosive against which the power of nuclear explosions are measured   Nitrogen can also be found in organic compounds  Common nitrogen functional groups include  amines  amides  nitro groups  imines  and enamines  The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method   6  Applications  6 1  Nitrogen gas  Nitrogen gas has a variety of applications  including serving as an inert replacement for air where oxidation is undesirable   As a modified atmosphere  pure or mixed with carbon dioxide  to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods  by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage   Pure nitrogen as food additive is labelled in the European Union with the E number E941   In incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon   In photolithography in deep ultraviolet  nitrogenation is used to avoid the strong oxygen absorption of UV at these wavelengths   Dried and pressurized  as a dielectric gas for high voltage equipment   The manufacturing of stainless steel   Used in some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard   see inerting system    On top of liquid explosives as a safety measure   Filling automotive and aircraft tires due to its inertness and lack of moisture or oxidative qualities  as opposed to air  Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation procedures for chemical analysis  It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples  Directing a pressurized stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid allows the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute s  and un evaporated solvent behind   Nitrogen can be used as a replacement  or in combination with  carbon dioxide to pressurize kegs of some beers  particularly stouts and British ales  due to the smaller bubbles it produces  which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier  A pressure sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a  widget  allows nitrogen charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles   Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns  Nitrogen must be kept at higher pressure than CO2  making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive   6 2  Liquid nitrogen  Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid  At atmospheric pressure  it boils at −195 8 °C  When insulated in proper containers such as Dewar flasks  it can be transported without much evaporative loss   Like dry ice  the main use of liquid nitrogen is as a refrigerant  Among other things  it is used in the cryopreservation of blood  reproductive cells  sperm and egg   and other biological samples and materials  It is used in the clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin  It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X ray detectors  It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked  and that produce more heat than during normal operation   6 3  Nitrogen compounds  Molecular nitrogen  N2  in the atmosphere is relatively non reactive due to its strong triple bond  N≡N  and molecular nitrogen plays an inert role in the human body  being neither produced nor destroyed  In nature  nitrogen is converted into biologically  and industrially  useful compounds by lightning  and by some living organisms  notably certain bacteria  i e   nitrogen fixing bacteria—see Biological role below   Molecular nitrogen is released into the atmosphere in the process of decay  in dead plant and animal tissues   The ability to combine  or fix  molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry  Previously to the 20th century  access to nitrogen compounds for fertilizers and gunpowder had been through deposits of natural nitrates  such as Chilean saltpeter  However  first the Frank–Caro process for producing cyanamide  and then the Haber–Bosch process for producing ammonia from air and natural gas  developed just before the first world war  eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds  to the extent that half of global food production now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers   The Ostwald process  developed a few years before the Haber process  allowed large scale production of nitric acid and nitrate from ammonia  thus freeing large scale industrial production of nitrate explosives and weapons propellants from the need to mine nitrate salt deposits  The organic and inorganic salts of nitric acid have been important historically as convenient stores of chemical energy for warfare and rocket fuels  Historically  such compounds included important compounds such as potassium nitrate  used in gunpowder which was often produced by biological means  bacterial fermentation  before natural mineral sources were discovered  Later  all such sources were displaced by industrial production  in the early 1900s   Ammonium nitrate has been used as both fertilizer and explosive  see ANFO   Various other nitrated organic compounds  such as nitroglycerin  trinitrotoluene  and nitrocellulose  are used as explosives and propellants for modern firearms  Nitric acid is used as an oxidizing agent in liquid fueled rockets  Hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives find use as rocket fuels and monopropellants  In most of these compounds  the basic instability and tendency to burn or explode is derived from the fact that nitrogen is present as an oxide  and not as the far more stable nitrogen molecule  N2   which is a product of the compounds  thermal decomposition  When nitrates burn or explode  the formation of the powerful triple bond in the N2 produces most of the energy of the reaction   Nitrogen is a constituent of molecules in every major drug class in pharmacology and medicine  Nitrous oxide  N2O  was discovered early in the 19th century to be a partial anesthetic  though it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until later  Called  laughing gas   it was found capable of inducing a state of social disinhibition resembling drunkenness  Other notable nitrogen containing drugs are drugs derived from plant alkaloids  such as morphine  there exist many alkaloids known to have pharmacological effects  in some cases  they appear as natural chemical defenses of plants against predation   Drugs that contain nitrogen include all major classes of antibiotics and organic nitrate drugs like nitroglycerin and nitroprusside that regulate blood pressure and heart action by mimicking the action of nitric oxide   7  Biological role  Nitrogen is an essential building block of amino and nucleic acids  essential to life on Earth   Elemental nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals  and must be converted to a reduced  or  fixed   state to be useful for higher plants and animals  Precipitation often contains substantial quantities of ammonium and nitrate  thought to result from nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena  This was first proposed by Liebig in 1827 and later confirmed  However  because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate  most fixed nitrogen reaches the soil surface under trees as nitrate  Soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium   Specific bacteria  e g   Rhizobium trifolium  possess nitrogenase enzymes that can fix atmospheric nitrogen  see nitrogen fixation  into a form  ammonium ion  that is chemically useful to higher organisms  This process requires a large amount of energy and anoxic conditions  Such bacteria may live freely in soil  e g   Azotobacter  but normally exist in a symbiotic relationship in the root nodules of leguminous plants  e g  clover  Trifolium  or soybean plant  Glycine max  and fertilizer trees  Nitrogen fixing bacteria are also symbiotic with a number of unrelated plant species such as alders  Alnus  spp   lichens  Casuarina  Myrica  liverworts  and Gunnera   As part of the symbiotic relationship  the plant converts the  fixed  ammonium ion to nitrogen oxides and amino acids to form proteins and other molecules   e g   alkaloids   In return for the  fixed  nitrogen  the plant secretes sugars to the symbiotic bacteria  Legumes maintain an anaerobic  oxygen free  environment for their nitrogen fixing bacteria   Plants are able to assimilate nitrogen directly in the form of nitrates that may be present in soil from natural mineral deposits  artificial fertilizers  animal waste  or organic decay  as the product of bacteria  but not bacteria specifically associated with the plant   Nitrates absorbed in this fashion are converted to nitrites by the enzyme nitrate reductase  and then converted to ammonia by another enzyme called nitrite reductase   Nitrogen compounds are basic building blocks in animal biology as well  Animals use nitrogen containing amino acids from plant sources as starting materials for all nitrogen compound animal biochemistry  including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids  Plant feeding insects are dependent on nitrogen in their diet  such that varying the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to a plant can affect the reproduction rate of insects feeding on fertilized plants   Soluble nitrate is an important limiting factor in the growth of certain bacteria in ocean waters  In many places in the world  artificial fertilizers applied to crop lands to increase yields result in run off delivery of soluble nitrogen to oceans at river mouths  This process can result in eutrophication of the water  as nitrogen driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die  Well known  dead zone  areas in the U S  Gulf Coast and the Black Sea are due to this important polluting process   Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment  conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odor in unfresh saltwater fish  In animals  free radical nitric oxide  NO   derived from an amino acid   serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation   Nitric oxide s rapid reaction with water in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite  Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins  in general  results in excretion of urea  while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid  The characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long chain  nitrogen containing amines  such as putrescine and cadaverine  which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine  respectively  in decaying proteins   Decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate  but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere  as molecular nitrogen  The circulation of nitrogen from atmosphere  to organic compounds  then back to the atmosphere  is referred to as the nitrogen cycle   8  Safety  Rapid release of nitrogen gas into an enclosed space can displace oxygen  and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard  This may happen with few warning symptoms  since the human carotid body is a relatively slow and a poor low oxygen  hypoxia  sensing system  An example occurred shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission in 1981  when two technicians lost consciousness  and one of them died  after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle s Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurized with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire  The technicians would have been able to exit the room if they had experienced early symptoms from nitrogen breathing   When inhaled at high partial pressures  more than about 4 bar  encountered at depths below about 30 m in scuba diving   nitrogen begins to act as an anesthetic agent  It can cause nitrogen narcosis  a temporary semi anesthetized state of mental impairment similar to that caused by nitrous oxide   Nitrogen also dissolves in the bloodstream and body fats  Rapid decompression  in particular  in the case of divers ascending too quickly  or astronauts decompressing too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure  can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness  formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends   when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream  nerves  joints  and other sensitive or vital areas  Bubbles from other  inert  gases  those gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen  cause the same effects  so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis  but does not prevent decompression sickness   Direct skin contact with liquid nitrogen will cause severe frostbite  cryogenic  burns    This may happen almost instantly on contact  or after a second or more  depending on the form of liquid nitrogen  Bulk liquid nitrogen causes less rapid freezing than a spray of nitrogen mist  such as is used to freeze certain skin growths in the practice of dermatology   The extra surface area provided by nitrogen soaked materials is also important  with soaked clothing or cotton causing far more rapid damage than a spill of direct liquid to skin  Full  contact  between naked skin and large collected droplets or pools of liquid nitrogen may be prevented for a second or two  by a layer of insulating gas from the Leidenfrost effect  This may give the skin a second of protection from nitrogen bulk liquid  However  liquid nitrogen applied to skin in mists  and on fabrics  bypasses this effect  and causes local frostbite immediately   Oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space   9
