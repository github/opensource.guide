Scientific misconduct is the violation of the standard codes of scholarly conduct and ethical behavior in professional scientific research  A Lancet review on Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries provides the following sample definitions   reproduced in The COPE report 1999    Danish definition   Intention or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist   Swedish definition   Intention al  distortion of the research process by fabrication of data  text  hypothesis  or methods from another researcher s manuscript form or publication  or distortion of the research process in other ways   The consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for both perpetrators and any individual who exposes it  In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on dubious research findings   1  Motivation to commit scientific misconduct  According to David Goodstein of Caltech  there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct  which are briefly summarised here    Career pressure  2  Forms of scientific misconduct  The U S  National Science Foundation defines three types of research misconduct  fabrication  falsification  and plagiarism   Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting them  This is sometimes referred to as  drylabbing   A more minor form of fabrication is where references are included to give arguments the appearance of widespread acceptance  but are actually fake  and or do not support the argument   Falsification is manipulating research materials  equipment  or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record   Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person s ideas  processes  results  or words without giving appropriate credit  One form is the appropriation of the ideas and results of others  and publishing as to make it appear the author had performed all the work under which the data was obtained  A subset is citation plagiarism – willful or negligent failure to appropriately credit other or prior discoverers  so as to give an improper impression of priority  This is also known as   citation amnesia   the  disregard syndrome  and  bibliographic negligence   Arguably  this is the most common type of scientific misconduct  Sometimes it is difficult to guess whether authors intentionally ignored a highly relevant cite or lacked knowledge of the prior work  Discovery credit can also be inadvertently reassigned from the original discoverer to a better known researcher  This is a special case of the Matthew effect   Plagiarism Fabrication   the act of taking an unrelated figure from an unrelated publication and reproducing it exactly in a new publication  claiming that it represents new data   Recent papers from the University of Cordoba have come to light showing how this can go undetected and unchallenged for years   Self plagiarism – or multiple publication of the same content with different titles and or in different journals is sometimes also considered misconduct  scientific journals explicitly ask authors not to do this  It is referred to as  salami   i e  many identical slices  in the jargon of medical journal editors  MJE   According to some MJE this includes publishing the same article in a different language  Other types of research misconduct are also recognized   The violation of ethical standards regarding human and animal experiments – such as the standard that a human subject of the experiment must give informed consent to the experiment  Failure to obtain ethical approval for clinical studies characterised the case of Joachim Boldt   Ghostwriting – the phenomenon where someone other than the named author s  makes a major contribution  Typically  this is done to mask contributions from drug companies  It incorporates plagiarism and has an additional element of financial fraud   Conversely  research misconduct is not limited to NOT listing authorship  but also includes the conferring authorship on those that have not made substantial contributions to the research  This is done by senior researchers who muscle their way onto the papers of inexperienced junior researchers as well as others that stack authorship in an effort to guarantee publication  This is much harder to prove due to a lack of consistency in defining  authorship  or  substantial contribution   In addition  some academics consider suppression—the failure to publish significant findings due to the results being adverse to the interests of the researcher or his her sponsor s —to be a form of misconduct as well   Bare assertions – making entirely unsubstantiated claims   may also be considered a form of research misconduct although there is no evidence that cases of this form have ever led to a finding of misconduct  In some cases  scientific misconduct may also constitute violations of the law  but not always  Being accused of the activities described in this article is a serious matter for a practicing scientist  with severe consequences should it be determined that a researcher intentionally or carelessly engaged in misconduct  However in most countries  committing research misconduct  even on a large scale  is not a legal offence   Three percent of the 3 475 research institutions that report to the US Department of Health and Human Services  Office of Research Integrity  indicate some form of scientific misconduct  However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants  They routinely monitor such research publication for red flags  Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors  COJE  can only police their own members   The validity of the methods and results of scientific papers are often scrutinized in journal clubs  In this venue  members can decide amongst themselves with the help of peers if a scientific paper s ethical standards are met   3  Responsibility of authors and of coauthors  Authors and coauthors of scientific publications have a variety of responsibilities  Contravention of the rules of scientific authorship may lead to a charge of scientific misconduct  All authors  including coauthors  are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication  Simultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct  under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule  named after the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine 1967 1977  Franz Ingelfinger   Guest authorship  where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement  also known as gift authorship  and ghost authorship  where the real author is not listed as an author  are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct  In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor  Examples include the case of Gerald Schatten who co authored with Hwang Woo Suk  the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce   Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce s deception    and the coauthors with Jan Hendrik Schön at Bell Laboratories  More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff  then the editor in chief of Neuropsychopharmacology  and a well documented case involving the drug Actonel   Authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication  The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct  Some scientific journals require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors might have commercial or non commercial conflicts of interest  Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research  particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material  Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct  Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct  The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies  Nemeroff  Blumsohn    4  Responsibilities of research institutions  In general  defining whether an individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual s employing academic institution  Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly  Furthermore  the more senior the individual under suspicion  the more likely it is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation  In many countries  with the notable exception of the United States  acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct  Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner  or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation   Well publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct  A King s College  London  internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be  at best unreliable  and in many cases spurious  but the college took no action  such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring  It was only 10 years later  when an entirely separate form of misconduct by the same individual was being investigated by the General Medical Council  that the internal report came to light   In a more recent case an internal investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science  NCCS   Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Dr  Gopal Kundu  but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation  and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct  Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration  the relevant journal  Journal of Biological Chemistry  withdrew the paper based on its own analysis   5  Responsibilities of scientific colleagues who are  bystanders   Some academics believe that scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves  or reporting their concerns  This question is of great importance since much research suggests that it is very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior  unless they have help from their organizations  A  User friendly Guide   and the existence of a confidential organizational ombudsman may help people who are uncertain about what to do  or afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up   6  Responsibility of journals  Journals are responsible for safeguarding the research record and hence have a critical role in dealing with suspected misconduct  This is recognised by the Committee on Publication Ethics  COPE  which has issued clear guidelines on the form  e g  retraction  that concerns over the research record should take   The COPE guidelines state that journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable  either as a result of misconduct  e g  data fabrication  or honest error  e g  miscalculation or experimental error   Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication  plagiarism and unethical research   Journal editors should consider issuing an expression of concern if they receive inconclusive evidence of research or publication misconduct by the authors  there is evidence that the findings are unreliable but the authors  institution will not investigate the case  they believe that an investigation into alleged misconduct related to the publication either has not been  or would not be  fair and impartial or conclusive  or an investigation is underway but a judgement will not be available for a considerable time   Journal editors should consider issuing a correction if a small portion of an otherwise reliable publication proves to be misleading  especially because of honest error   or the author   contributor list is incorrect  i e  a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included   Recent evidence has emerged that journals learning of cases where there is strong evidence of possible misconduct  with issues potentially affecting a large portion of the findings  frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken  In one case the Journal of Clinical Oncology issued a Correction despite strong evidence that the original paper was invalid  In another case  Nature allowed a Corrigendum to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud  Subsequent Retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower   The recent cases of Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii in anaesthesiology have focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it  In the Boldt case  the Editors in Chief of 18 specialist journals  generally anaesthesia and intensive care  made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval  In the Fujii case  involving nearly 200 papers  the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia  which published 24 of Fujii s papers  has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate  Following publication of a Letter to the Editor from Kranke and colleagues in April 2000  along with a non specific response from Dr  Fujii  there was no follow up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr  Fujii s research  Anesthesia & Analgesia went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr  Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud  with Editor Steven Shafer stating in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the Journal by Dr  Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud  In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement  in the form of an ultimatum made available to the public  to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed  offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers   7  Photo manipulation  Compared to other forms of scientific misconduct  image fraud  manipulation of images to distort their meaning  is of particular interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties  In 2006  the Journal of Cell Biology gained publicity for instituting tests to detect photo manipulation in papers that were being considered for publication  This was in response to the increased usage of programs by scientists such as Adobe Photoshop  which facilitate photo manipulation  Since then more publishers  including the Nature Publishing Group  have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication  However there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously  One Nature paper published in 2009 has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances of image fraud   Although the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another  in general the following manipulations are not allowed   splicing together different images to represent a single experiment  changing brightness and contrast of only a part of the image  any change that conceals information  even when it is considered to be aspecific  which includes   changing brightness and contrast to leave only the most intense signal  using clone tools to hide information  showing only a very small part of the photograph so that additional information is not visible  8  Suppression non publication of data  A related issue concerns the deliberate suppression  failure to publish  or selective release of the findings of scientific studies  Such cases may not be strictly definable as scientific misconduct as the deliberate falsification of results is not present  However  in such cases the intent may nevertheless be to deliberately deceive  Studies may be suppressed or remain unpublished because the findings are perceived to undermine the commercial  political or other interests of the sponsoring agent or because they fail to support the ideological goals of the researcher  Examples include the failure to publish studies if they demonstrate the harm of a new drug  or truthfully publishing the benefits of a treatment while omitting harmful side effects   This is distinguishable from other concepts such as bad science  junk science or pseudoscience where the criticism centres on the methodology or underlying assumptions  It may be possible in some cases to use statistical methods to show that the datasets offered in relation to a given field are incomplete  However this may simply reflect the existence of real world restrictions on researchers without justifying more sinister conclusions   Some cases go beyond the failure to publish complete reports of all findings with researchers knowingly making false claims based on falsified data  This falls clearly under the definition of scientific misconduct  even if the result was achieved by suppressing data   9  Consequences for science  The consequences of scientific fraud vary based on the severity of the fraud  the level of notice it receives  and how long it goes undetected  For cases of fabricated evidence  the consequences can be wide ranging  with others working to confirm  or refute  the false finding  or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence  The Piltdown Man fraud is a case in point  The significance of the bona fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported  In addition  the prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward spent time at Piltdown each year until he died  trying to find more Piltdown Man remains  The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution   The Taung Child  which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first  was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence    In the case of Prof Don Poldermans  the misconduct occurred in reports of trials of treatment to prevent death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing operations  The trial reports were relied upon to issue guidelines that applied for many years across North America and Europe   In the case of Dr Alfred Steinschneider  two decades and tens of millions of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea  which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory  and sudden infant death syndrome  SIDS   of which he stated it was a precursor  The cover was blown in 1994  22 years after Steinschneider s 1972 Pediatrics paper claiming such an association  when Waneta Hoyt  the mother of the patients in the paper  was arrested  indicted and convicted on 5 counts of second degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children  While that in itself was bad enough  the paper  presumably written as an attempt to save infants  lives  ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of Münchausen syndrome by proxy  The 1972 Pediatrics paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on Pubmed without comment   10  Consequences for those who expose misconduct  The potentially severe consequences for individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research  This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct  Persons who expose such cases  commonly called whistleblowers  can find themselves open to retaliation by a number of different means  These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters   designed to protect those who raise concerns  A whistleblower is almost always alone in their fight   their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct  If the accusations prove false  their career is completely destroyed  but even in case of positive decision the career of the whistleblower can be under question  their reputation of  troublemaker  will prevent many employers from hiring them  There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns  If a university fails to investigate suspected fraud or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal   11  Exposure of fraudulent data  With the advancement of the internet  there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature  One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr  Harold Garner s laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is Déjà vu  an open access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication  All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm eTBLAST  also created in Dr  Garner s laboratory  The creation of Déjà vu and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as ethical behavior  journal standards  and intellectual copyright  Studies on this database have been published in journals such as Nature and Science  among others   Other tools which may be used to detect fraudulent data include error analysis  Measurements generally have a small amount of error  and repeated measurements of the same item will generally result in slight differences in readings  These differences can be analyzed  and follow certain known mathematical and statistical properties  Should a set of data appear to be too faithful to the hypothesis  i e   the amount of error that would normally be in such measurements does not appear  a conclusion can be drawn that the data may have been forged  Error analysis alone is typically not sufficient to prove that data have been falsified or fabricated  but it may provide the supporting evidence necessary to confirm suspicions of misconduct   12  Data sharing  Kirby Lee and Lisa Bero suggest   Although reviewing raw data can be difficult  time consuming and expensive  having such a policy would hold authors more accountable for the accuracy of their data and potentially reduce scientific fraud or misconduct    13  Individual cases  13 1  Research conducted during employment by an institution or a corporation  13 1 1  China  H  Zhong  T  Liu  and their co workers at Jinggangshan University have retracted numerous papers published in Acta Crystallographica following systematic checking which revealed that the organic structures claimed in these papers were impossible or implausible  The supporting data appeared to have been taken from valid cases which had then been altered by substituting different atoms

copied and pasted and published  as two separate articles  in the seven years later  After the plagiarism was discovered in 2014  both papers were retracted by the Managing Editor  The HIT administration s handling of the plagiarism affair received some public criticism as the academic dishonesty of Dr  Spivak has not been openly denounced by the HIT officials and the plagiator was even awarded a sabbatical leave  which is not a vested right of the faculty in Israeli colleges    13 1 6  Japan  Teruji Cho  Plasma Physics   Cho and three coworkers falsified raw data reported in a
