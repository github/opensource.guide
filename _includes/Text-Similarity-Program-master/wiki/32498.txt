Volume is the quantity of three dimensional space enclosed by some closed boundary  for example  the space that a substance  solid  liquid  gas  or plasma  or shape occupies or contains  Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit  the cubic metre  The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container  i  e  the amount of fluid  gas or liquid  that the container could hold  rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces   Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes  Volumes of some simple shapes  such as regular  straight edged  and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas  Volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape s boundary  Where a variance in shape and volume occurs  such as those that exist between different human beings  these can be calculated using three dimensional techniques such as the Body Volume Index  One dimensional figures  such as lines  and two dimensional shapes  such as squares  are assigned zero volume in the three dimensional space   The volume of a solid  whether regularly or irregularly shaped  can be determined by fluid displacement  Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas  The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances  However  sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive   In differential geometry  volume is expressed by means of the volume form  and is an important global Riemannian invariant  In thermodynamics  volume is a fundamental parameter  and is a conjugate variable to pressure   1  Units  Any unit of length gives a corresponding unit of volume  namely the volume of a cube whose side has the given length  For example  a cubic centimetre  cm3  would be the volume of a cube whose sides are one centimetre  1 cm  in length   In the International System of Units  SI   the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre  m3   The metric system also includes the litre  L  as a unit of volume  where one litre is the volume of a 10 centimetre cube  Thus  so  Small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres  where  Various other traditional units of volume are also in use  including the cubic inch  the cubic foot  the cubic mile  the teaspoon  the tablespoon  the fluid ounce  the fluid dram  the gill  the pint  the quart  the gallon  the minim  the barrel  the cord  the peck  the bushel  and the hogshead   2  Related terms  Volume and capacity are sometimes distinguished  with capacity being used for how much a container can hold  with contents measured commonly in litres or its derived units   and volume being how much space an object displaces  commonly measured in cubic metres or its derived units    Volume and capacity are also distinguished in capacity management  where capacity is defined as volume over a specified time period  However in this context the term volume may be more loosely interpreted to mean quantity   The density of an object is defined as mass per unit volume  The inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass  Specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied   The volumetric flow rate in fluid dynamics is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time  for example cubic meters per second  m3 s−1     3  Volume in Calculus  In calculus  a branch of mathematics  the volume of a region D in R3 is given by a triple integral of the constant function and is usually written as   The volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is  and the volume integral in spherical coordinates  using the convention for angles with as the azimuth and measured from the polar axis  see more on conventions   has the form  4  Volume formulae  4 1  Volume ratios for a cone  sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height  The above formulas can be used to show that the volumes of a cone  sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height are in the ratio 1   2   3  as follows   Let the radius be r and the height be h  which is 2r for the sphere   then the volume of cone is  the volume of the sphere is  while the volume of the cylinder is  The discovery of the 2   3 ratio of the volumes of the sphere and cylinder is credited to Archimedes   5  Volume formula derivations  5 1  Sphere  The volume of a sphere is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx  The calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as follows   The surface area of the circular disk is    The radius of the circular disks  defined such that the x axis cuts perpendicularly through them  is   or  where y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value   Using y as the disk radius  the volume of the sphere can be calculated as  Now  Combining yields  This formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the sphere s surface area  which is   The volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells  and the sphere volume is equal to     5 2  Cone  The cone is a type of pyramidal shape  The fundamental equation for pyramids  one third times base times altitude  applies to cones as well   However  using calculus  the volume of a cone is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular disks of thickness dx  The calculation for the volume of a cone of height h  whose base is centered at  0 0 0  with radius r  is as follows   The radius of each circular disk is r if x   0 and 0 if x   h  and varying linearly in between—that is   The surface area of the circular disk is then  The volume of the cone can then be calculated as  and after extraction of the constants   Integrating gives us  6  Volume in differential geometry  In differential geometry  a branch of mathematics  a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree  i e  whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold  that is nowhere equal to zero  A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable  An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms  since multiplying a volume form by a non vanishing function yields another volume form  On non orientable manifolds  one may instead define the weaker notion of a density  Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form   Any oriented Riemannian  or pseudo Riemannian  manifold has a natural volume  or pseudo volume  form  In local coordinates  it can be expressed as  where the are the 1 forms providing an oriented basis for the cotangent bundle of the n dimensional manifold  Here  is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix representation of the metric tensor on the manifold   7  Volume in thermodynamics  In thermodynamics  the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state  The specific volume  an intensive property  is the system s volume per unit of mass  Volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature  For example  volume is related to the pressure and temperature of an ideal gas by the ideal gas law   8  See also  9  References  10  External links  – Javascript automatic calculator
