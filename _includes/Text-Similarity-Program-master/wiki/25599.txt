Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37  Rubidium is a soft  silvery white metallic element of the alkali metal group  with an atomic mass of 85 4678  Elemental rubidium is highly reactive  with properties similar to those of other alkali metals  such as very rapid oxidation in air  Natural rubidium is a mix of two isotopes  85Rb  the only stable one  constitutes 72% of it  The remaining 28% is the slightly radioactive 87Rb with a half life of 49 billion years—more than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe   German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy   Rubidium s compounds have various chemical and electronic applications  Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range  making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms   Rubidium is not known to be necessary for any living organisms  However  rubidium ions are handled by living organisms in a manner similar to potassium ions  being actively taken up by plants and by animal cells   1  Characteristics  Rubidium is a very soft  ductile  silvery white metal  It is the second most electropositive of the non radioactive alkali metals and melts at a temperature of   Similar to other alkali metals  rubidium metal reacts violently with water  forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold  iron  caesium  sodium  and potassium  but not lithium  even though rubidium and lithium are in the same group   As with potassium  which is slightly less reactive  and caesium  which is slightly more reactive   rubidium s reaction with water is usually vigorous enough to ignite the hydrogen gas it liberates  Rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air  Rubidium has a very low ionization energy of only 406 kJ mol  Rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test  which makes spectroscopy methods necessary to distinguish the two elements   1 1  Compounds  Rubidium chloride  RbCl  is probably the most used rubidium compound  it is used in biochemistry to induce cells to take up DNA  and as a biomarker since it is readily taken up to replace potassium  and occurs in only small quantities in living organisms  Other common rubidium compounds are the corrosive rubidium hydroxide  RbOH   the starting material for most rubidium based chemical processes  rubidium carbonate  Rb2CO3   which is used in some optical glasses  and rubidium copper sulfate  Rb2SO4·CuSO4·6H2O  Rubidium silver iodide  RbAg4I5  has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal  a property that is being exploited in thin film batteries and other applications   Rubidium has a number of oxides  including rubidium monoxide  Rb2O   Rb6O and Rb9O2  which form if rubidium metal is exposed to air  rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2  Rubidium forms salts with halides  making rubidium fluoride  rubidium chloride  rubidium bromide  and rubidium iodide   1 2  Isotopes  Although rubidium is monoisotopic  naturally occurring rubidium is composed of two isotopes  the stable 85Rb  72 2%  and the radioactive 87Rb  27 8%   Natural rubidium is radioactive with specific activity of about 670 Bq g  enough to significantly expose a photographic film in 110 days  Aside from 85Rb and 87Rb  another 24 synthetically produced isotopes of rubidium are known  with half lives of under 3 months  most of these are highly radioactive and have few uses   Rubidium 87 has a half life of  years  which is more than three times the age of the universe of  years  making it a primordial nuclide  It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals  and is therefore fairly widespread  Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks  87Rb decays to stable 87Sr by emission of a negative beta particle  During fractional crystallization  Sr tends to become concentrated in plagioclase  leaving Rb in the liquid phase  Hence  the Rb Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time  resulting in rocks with elevated Rb Sr ratios due to progressing differentiation  The highest ratios  10 or more  occur in pegmatites  If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated  then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr 86Sr ratio  The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered  see rubidium strontium dating    Rubidium 82  one of the element s non natural isotopes  is produced by electron capture decay of strontium 82 with a half life of 25 36 days  The subsequent decay of rubidium 82 with a half life of 76 seconds to stable krypton 82 happens by positron emission   1 3  Occurrence  Rubidium is the twenty third most abundant element in the Earth s crust  roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper  It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite  pollucite  carnallite  and zinnwaldite  which contain up to 1% of its oxide  Lepidolite contains between 0 3% and 3 5% rubidium  and is the commercial source of the element  Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant amounts   Seawater contains an average of 125 µg L of rubidium compared to the much higher value for potassium of 408 mg L and the much lower value of 0 3 µg L for caesium   Because of its large ionic radius  rubidium is one of the  incompatible elements   During magma crystallization  rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in the liquid phase and crystallizes last  Therefore the largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process  Because rubidium substitutes for potassium in the crystallization of magma  the enrichment is far less effective than in the case of caesium  Zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or the lithium minerals lepidolite are also a source for rubidium as a by product   Two notable sources of rubidium are the rich deposits of pollucite at Bernic Lake  Manitoba  Canada  and the rubicline   Rb K AlSi3O8  found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of Elba  with a rubidium content of 17 5%  Both of these deposits are also sources of caesium   2  Production  Although rubidium is more abundant in Earth s crust than caesium  the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year  Several methods are available for separating potassium  rubidium  and caesium  The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum  Cs Rb Al SO4 2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum  Two other methods are reported  the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process   For several years in the 1950s and 1960s  a by product of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium  Alkarb contained 21% rubidium  with the rest being potassium and a small fraction of caesium  Today the largest producers of caesium  such as the Tanco Mine  Manitoba  Canada  produce rubidium as by product from pollucite   3  History  Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff  in Heidelberg  Germany  in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope  Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum  they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus  meaning  dark red    Rubidium is present as a minor component in lepidolite  Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150 kg of a lepidolite containing only 0 24% rubidium oxide  Rb2O   Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid  but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water  Therefore  the less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate  Rb2PtCl6  could be obtained by fractional crystallization  After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen  this process yielded 0 51 grams of rubidium chloride for further studies  The first large scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds  performed from 44 000 liters of mineral water by Bunsen and Kirchhoff  yielded  besides 7 3 grams of caesium chloride  also 9 2 grams of rubidium chloride  Rubidium was the second element  shortly after caesium  to be discovered spectroscopically  only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff   The two scientists used the rubidium chloride thus obtained to estimate the atomic weight of the new element as 85 36  the currently accepted value is 85 47   They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride  but instead of a metal  they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which  neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance   They assigned it as a subchloride     however  the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride  In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium  Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate  Although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric  it was possible to determine the density and the melting point of rubidium  The quality of the research done in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs less than 0 1 g cm3 and the melting point by less than 1 °C from the presently accepted values   The slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908 but before the theory of isotopes was established in the 1910s and the low activity due to the long half life of above 1010 years made interpretation complicated  The now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s   Rubidium had minimal industrial value before the 1920s  Since then  the most important use of rubidium has been in research and development  primarily in chemical and electronic applications  In 1995  rubidium 87 was used to produce a Bose–Einstein condensate  for which the discoverers  Eric Allin Cornell  Carl Edwin Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle  won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics   4  Applications  Rubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color  Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle  where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field  These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current  Rubidium  particularly vaporized 87Rb  is one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation  Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength  and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures   Rubidium has been used for polarizing 3He  producing volumes of magnetized 3He gas  with the nuclear spins aligned toward a particular direction in space  rather than randomly   Rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser and the polarized Rb polarizes 3He through the hyperfine interaction   Such spin polarized 3He cells are becoming popular for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes   The resonant element in atomic clocks utilizes the hyperfine structure of rubidium s energy levels  making rubidium useful for high precision timing  and is used as the main component of secondary frequency references  rubidium oscillators  to maintain frequency accuracy in cell site transmitters and other electronic transmitting  networking  and test equipment  These rubidium standards are often used with GPS to produce a  primary frequency standard  that has greater accuracy and is less expensive than caesium standards  Such rubidium standards are often mass produced for the telecommunication industry   Other potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines  as a getter in vacuum tubes  and as a photocell component  Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass  in the production of superoxide by burning in oxygen  in the study of potassium ion channels in biology  and as the vapor to make atomic magnetometers  In particular  87Rb is currently being used  with other alkali metals  in the development of spin exchange relaxation free  SERF  magnetometers   Rubidium 82 is used for positron emission tomography  Rubidium is very similar to potassium and therefore tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate the radioactive rubidium  One of the main uses is in myocardial perfusion imaging  The very short half life of 76 seconds makes it necessary to produce the rubidium 82 from decay of strontium 82 close to the patient  As a result of changes in the blood brain barrier in brain tumors  rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue  allowing the use of radioisotope rubidium 82 in nuclear medicine to locate and image brain tumors   Rubidium was tested for the influence on manic depression and depression  Dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium and therefore a supplementation may help during depression  In some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720 mg per day for 60 days   5  Precautions and biological effects  Rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires  To ensure safety and purity  this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere  Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffusing into oil  and is thus subject to similar peroxide precautions as storage of metallic potassium   Rubidium  like sodium and potassium  almost always has +1 oxidation state when dissolved in water  including its presence in all biological systems  The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions as if they were potassium ions  and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body s intracellular fluid  i e   inside cells   The ions are not particularly toxic  a 70 kg person contains on average 0 36 g of rubidium  and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons  The biological half life of rubidium in humans was measured as 31–46 days  Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible  rats with more than 50% of their potassium substituted in the muscle tissue died   6  See also  7  References  8  Further reading  Meites
