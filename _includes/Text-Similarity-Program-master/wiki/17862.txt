Lafayette Ronald Hubbard  March 13  1911 – January 24  1986   better known as L  Ron Hubbard      and often referred to by his initials  LRH  was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology  After establishing a career as a writer  becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories  he developed a self help system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950  He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide ranging set of doctrines and rituals as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology  His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration  literacy and drug rehabilitation   Although many aspects of Hubbard s life story are disputed  there is general agreement about its basic outline  Born in Tilden  Nebraska  he spent much of his childhood in Helena  Montana  He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father  an officer in the United States Navy  was posted to the U S  naval base on Guam  He attended George Washington University in Washington  D C  at the start of the 1930s  before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories  He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II  briefly commanding two ships  the USS YP 422 and USS PC 815  He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command  The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital  being treated for a duodenal ulcer   Later he developed Dianetics  something that he called  the modern science of mental health   He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization  During the late 1960s and early 1970s  he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as  Commodore  of the Sea Organization  an elite inner group of Scientologists  His expedition came to an end when Britain  Greece  Spain  Portugal  and Venezuela all closed their ports to his fleet  At one point  a court in Australia revoked the church s status as a religion  Similarly  a high court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud in absentia  He returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert  In 1983 L  Ron Hubbard was named as an unindicted co conspirator in an international information infiltration and theft project called  Operation Snow White   He spent the remaining years of his life on his ranch near Creston  California  where he died in 1986   The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms  and he portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer  world traveler  and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines  including photography  art  poetry  and philosophy  His critics including his own son have characterized him as a liar  a charlatan  and mentally unstable  Though many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious  the Church rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard s life is not historical fact   1  Early life  Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born in 1911  in Tilden  Nebraska  He was the only child of Ledora May   Waterbury   who had trained as a teacher  and Harry Ross Hubbard  a former United States Navy officer  After moving to Kalispell  Montana  they settled in Helena in 1913  Hubbard s father rejoined in the Navy in April 1917  during World War I  while his mother May worked as a clerk for the state government   Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology describe Hubbard as  a child prodigy of sorts  who rode a horse before he could walk and was able to read and write by the age of four  A Scientology profile says that he was brought up on his grandfather s  large cattle ranch in Montana  where he spent his days  riding  breaking broncos  hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer   His grandfather is described as a  wealthy Western cattleman  from whom Hubbard  inherited his fortune and family interests in America  Southern Africa  etc   Scientology claims that Hubbard became a  blood brother  of the Native American Blackfeet tribe at the age of six through his friendship with a Blackfeet medicine man   However  contemporary records show that his grandfather  Lafayette Waterbury  was a veterinarian  not a rancher  and was not wealthy  Hubbard was actually raised in a townhouse in the center of Helena  According to his aunt  his family did not own a ranch but did own one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside the city  Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation  The tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he had ever been a Blackfeet blood brother   During the 1920s the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas  After Hubbard s father Harry rejoined the Navy  his posting aboard the USS Oklahoma in 1921 required the family to relocate to the ship s home ports  first San Diego  then Seattle  During a journey to Washington  D C  in 1923 Hubbard learned of Freudian psychology from Commander Joseph  Snake  Thompson  a U S  Navy psychoanalyst and medic  Scientology biographies describe this encounter as giving Hubbard training in a particular scientific approach to the mind  which he found unsatisfying  Hubbard was active in the Boy Scouts in Washington  D C  and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 1924  two weeks after his 13th birthday  In his diary  Hubbard claimed he was the youngest Eagle Scout in the U S   The following year  Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton  Washington  His son was enrolled at Union High School  Bremerton  and later studied at Queen Anne High School in Seattle  In 1927 Hubbard s father was sent to the U S  Naval Station on Guam in the Mariana Islands of the South Pacific  Although Hubbard s mother also went to Guam  Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents  care in Helena  Montana to complete his schooling   Between 1927 and 1929 Hubbard traveled to Japan  China  the Philippines and Guam  Scientology texts present this period in his life as a time when he was intensely curious for answers to human suffering and explored ancient Eastern philosophies for answers  but found them lacking  He is described as traveling to China  at a time when few Westerners could enter  and according to Scientology  spent his time questioning Buddhist lamas and meeting old Chinese magicians  According to church materials  his travels were funded by his  wealthy grandfather    Hubbard s unofficial biographers present a very different account of his travels in Asia  Hubbard s diaries recorded two trips to the east coast of China  The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927  It consisted of a brief stop over in a couple of Chinese ports before traveling on to Guam  where he stayed for six weeks before returning home  He recorded his impressions of the places he visited and disdained the poverty of the inhabitants of Japan and China  whom he described as  gooks  and  lazy  and  ignorant   His second visit was a family holiday which took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928   After his return to the United States in September 1927  Hubbard enrolled at Helena High School but earned only poor grades  He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle  He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928  His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis  Maryland   Between October and December 1928 a number of naval families  including Hubbard s  traveled from Guam to China aboard the cargo ship   The ship stopped at Manila in the Philippines before traveling on to Qingdao  Tsingtao  in China  Hubbard and his parents made a side trip to Beijing before sailing on to Shanghai and Hong Kong  from where they returned to Guam  Scientology accounts present a different version of events  saying that Hubbard  made his way deep into Manchuria s Western Hills and beyond — to break bread with Mongolian bandits  share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of Kublai Khan    However  Hubbard did not record these events in his diary  He remained unimpressed with China and the Chinese  writing   A Chinaman can not live up to a thing  he always drags it down   He characterized the sights of Beijing as  rubberneck stations  for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as  very trashy looking  and  not worth mentioning   He was impressed by the Great Wall of China near Beijing  but concluded of the Chinese   They smell of all the baths they didn t take  The trouble with China is  there are too many chinks here    Back on Guam  Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays and failed the Naval Academy entrance examination  In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas  Virginia  to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination  However  he was ruled out of consideration due to his near sightedness  He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington  D C  to qualify for admission to George Washington University  He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September   2  University and explorations  Hubbard studied civil engineering during his two years at George Washington University at the behest of his father  who  decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics   While he did not graduate from George Washington  his time there subsequently became important because  as George Malko puts it   many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a graduate engineer  but  a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics    However  a Church of Scientology biography describes him as  never noted for being in class  and says that he  thoroughly detest ed  his subjects   He earned poor grades  was placed on probation in September 1931 and dropped out altogether in the fall of 1932   Scientology accounts say that he  studied nuclear physics at George Washington University in Washington  D C   before he started his studies about the mind  spirit and life  and Hubbard himself stated that he  set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe  something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy   His university records indicate that his exposure to  nuclear physics  consisted of one class in  atomic and molecular phenomena  for which he earned an  F  grade   Scientologists claim he was more interested in extracurricular activities  particularly writing and flying  According to church materials   he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation  and was  recognized as one of the country s most outstanding pilots  With virtually no training time  he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest   His airman certificate  however  records that he qualified to fly only gliders rather than powered aircraft and gave up his certificate when he could not afford the renewal fee   During Hubbard s final semester he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for  fifty young gentleman rovers  aboard the schooner Doris Hamlin commencing in June 1932  The aims of the  Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition  were stated as being to explore and film the pirate  strongholds and bivouacs of the Spanish Main  and to  collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums   It ran into trouble even before it left the port of Baltimore  Ten participants quit and storms blew the ship far off course to Bermuda  Eleven more members of the expedition quit there and more left when the ship arrived at Martinique  With the expedition running critically short of money  the ship s owners ordered it to return to Baltimore   Hubbard blamed the expedition s problems on the captain   the ship s dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous  requiring Ron Hubbard s hand at both the helm and the charts   Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the University of Michigan  the U S  Hydrographic Office  an unspecified national museum and the New York Times  though none of those institutions have any record of this  Hubbard later wrote that the expedition  was a crazy idea at best  and I knew it  but I went ahead anyway  chartered a four masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven t stopped their cursings yet   He called it  a two bit expedition and financial bust   which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds   After leaving university Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico on what the Church of Scientology calls the  Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition   Scientologists claim he  made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico  as a means of  augmenting his  father s  pay with a mining venture   during which he  sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold  as well as carrying out  much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native hillsmen   Hubbard s unofficial biographer Russell Miller writes that neither the United States Geological Survey nor the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources have any record of any such expedition   According to Miller  Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico in November 1932 after his father volunteered him for the Red Cross relief effort following the devastating 1932 San Ciprian hurricane  In a 1957 lecture Hubbard said that he had been  a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster   According to his own account  Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold  Towards the end of his stay on Puerto Rico he appears to have done some work for a Washington  D C  firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated  accompanying a surveyor in an investigation of a small property near the town of Luquillo  Puerto Rico  The survey was unsuccessful  A few years later  Hubbard wrote   3  Early literary career and Alaskan expedition  Hubbard became a well known and prolific writer for pulp fiction magazines during the 1930s  Scientology texts describe him as becoming  well established as an essayist  even before he had concluded college  Scientology claims he  solved his finances  and his desire to travel by writing anything that came to hand  and to have earned an  astronomical  rate of pay for the times   His literary career began with contributions to the George Washington University student newspaper  The University Hatchet  as a reporter for a few months in 1931  Six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933  The going rate for freelance writers at the time was only a cent a word  so Hubbard s total earnings from these articles would have been less than $100  The pulp magazine Thrilling Adventure became the first to publish one of his short stories  in February 1934  Over the next six years  pulp magazines published around 140 of his short stories under a variety of pen names  including Winchester Remington Colt  Kurt von Rachen  René Lafayette  Joe Blitz and Legionnaire 148   Although he was best known for his fantasy and science fiction stories  Hubbard wrote in a wide variety of genres  including adventure fiction  aviation  travel  mysteries  westerns and even romance  Hubbard knew and associated with writers such as Isaac Asimov  Robert A  Heinlein  L  Sprague de Camp and A  E  van Vogt  His first full length novel  Buckskin Brigades  was published in 1937  He became a  highly idiosyncratic  writer of science fiction after being taken under the wing of editor John W  Campbell  who published many of Hubbard s short stories and also serialized a number of well received novelettes that Hubbard wrote for Campbell s magazines Unknown and Astounding  These included Fear  Final Blackout and Typewriter in the Sky   According to the Church of Scientology  Hubbard was  called to Hollywood  to work on film scripts in the mid 1930s  although Scientology accounts differ as to exactly when this was  whether 1935  1936 or 1937   He wrote the script for The Secret of Treasure Island  a 1938 Columbia Pictures movie serial  The Church of Scientology claims he also worked on the Columbia serials The Mysterious Pilot  1937   The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok  1938  and The Spider Returns  1941   though his name does not appear on the credits  Hubbard also claimed to have written Dive Bomber  1941   Cecil B  DeMille s The Plainsman  1936  and John Ford s Stagecoach  1939    Hubbard s literary earnings helped him to support his new wife  Margaret  Polly  Grubb  She was already pregnant when they married on April 13  1933  but she had a spontaneous abortion shortly afterwards  a few months later  she became pregnant again  On May 7  1934  she gave birth prematurely to a son who was named Lafayette Ronald Hubbard  Jr  and the nickname  His Nibs   invariably shortened to  Nibs   Their second child  Katherine May  was born on January 15  1936  The Hubbards lived for a while in Laytonsville  Maryland  but were chronically short of money   In the spring of 1936 they moved to Bremerton  Washington  They lived there for a time with Hubbard s aunts and grandmother before finding a place of their own at nearby South Colby  According to one of his friends at the time  Robert MacDonald Ford  the Hubbards were  in fairly dire straits for money  but sustained themselves on the income from Hubbard s writing  Hubbard spent an increasing amount of time in New York City  working out of a hotel room where his wife suspected him of carrying on affairs with other women   Hubbard s authorship in mid 1938 of a still unpublished manuscript called Excalibur is highlighted by the Church of Scientology as a key step in developing the principles of Scientology and Dianetics  The manuscript is said by Scientologists to have outlined  the basic principles of human existence  and to have been the culmination of twenty years of research into  twenty one races and cultures including Pacific Northwest Indian tribes  Philippine Tagalogs and  as he was wont to joke  the people of the Bronx    According to Arthur J  Cox  a contributor to John W  Campbell s Astounding magazine  Hubbard told a 1948 convention of science fiction fans that Excalibur inspiration came during an operation in which he  died  for eight minutes   Gerry Armstrong  Hubbard s archivist  explains this as a dental extraction performed under nitrous oxide  a chemical known for its hallucinogenic effects    Arthur J  Burks  the President of the American Fiction Guild  wrote that an excited Hubbard called him and said   I want to see you right away  I have written THE book   Hubbard believed that Excalibur would  revolutionize everything  and that  it was somewhat more important  and would have a greater impact upon people  than the Bible   It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life  As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes   the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology    According to Burks  Hubbard  was so sure he had something  away out and beyond  anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers  telling them that he had written  THE book  and that they were to meet him at Penn Station  and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer   However  nobody bought the manuscript  Forrest J Ackerman  later Hubbard s literary agent  recalled that Hubbard told him  whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide  And he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in New York  he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was  the publisher called for the reader  the reader came in with the manuscript  threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window   Hubbard s failure to sell Excalibur depressed him  he told his wife in an October 1938 letter   Writing action pulp doesn t have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and  further  actually weakens my name  So you see I ve got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position   He went on   The manuscript later became part of Scientology mythology  An early 1950s Scientology publication offered signed  gold bound and locked  copies for the sum of $1 500 apiece  equivalent to about $29 000 now   It warned that  four of the first fifteen people who read it went insane  and that it would be   r eleased only on sworn statement not to permit other readers to read it  Contains data not to be released during Mr  Hubbard s stay on earth    Hubbard joined The Explorers Club in February 1940 on the strength of his claimed explorations in the Caribbean and survey flights in the United States  He persuaded the club to let him carry its flag on an  Alaskan Radio Experimental Expedition  to update the U S  Coast Pilot guide to the coastlines of Alaska and British Columbia and investigate new methods of radio position finding  The expedition consisted of Hubbard and his wife—the children were left at South Colby—aboard his ketch Magician   Scientology accounts of the expedition describe  Hubbard s recharting of an especially treacherous Inside Passage  and his ethnological study of indigenous Aleuts and Haidas  and tell of how  along the way  he not only roped a Kodiak Bear  but braved seventy mile an hour winds and commensurate seas off the Aleutian Islands   They are divided about how far Hubbard s expedition actually traveled  whether or    Hubbard told The Seattle Star in a November 1940 letter that the expedition was plagued by problems and did not get any further than Ketchikan near the southern end of the Alaska Panhandle  far from the Aleutian Islands  Magician s engine broke down only two days after setting off in July 1940  The Hubbards reached Ketchikan on August 30  1940  after many delays following repeated engine breakdowns  The Ketchikan Chronicle reported—making no mention of the expedition—that Hubbard s purpose in coming to Alaska  was two fold  one to win a bet and another to gather material for a novel of Alaskan salmon fishing   Having underestimated the cost of the trip  he did not have enough money to repair the broken engine  He raised money by writing stories and contributing to the local radio station and eventually earned enough to fix the engine  making it back to Puget Sound on December 27  1940   4  Military career  After returning from Alaska  Hubbard applied to join the United States Navy  His Congressman  Warren G  Magnuson  wrote to President Roosevelt to recommend Hubbard as  a gentleman of reputation  who was  a respected explorer  and had  marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States   Hubbard was described as  a key figure  in writing organizations   making him politically potent nationally   The Congressman concluded   Anything you can do for Mr Hubbard will be appreciated   His friend Robert MacDonald Ford  by now a State Representative for Washington  sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as  one of the most brilliant men I have ever known   It called Hubbard  a powerful influence  in the Northwest and said that he was  well known in many parts of the world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska   The letter declared that  for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him   Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself   I don t know why Ron wanted a letter  I just gave him a letter head and said   Hell  you re the writer  you write it     Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant  junior grade  in the U S  Naval Reserve on July 19  1941  His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists  The Church of Scientology presents him as a  much decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded   Scientology publications say he served as a  Commodore of Corvette squadrons  in  all five theaters of World War II  and was awarded  twenty one medals and palms  for his service  He was  severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded  to a military hospital  where he  worked his way back to fitness  strength and full perception in less than two years  using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe   He said that he had seen combat repeatedly  telling A  E  van Vogt that he had once sailed his ship  right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the Dutch East Indies  His attitude was that if you took your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another  so he tied up at the dock  went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days    Hubbard s official Navy service records indicate that  his military performance was  at times  substandard  and he received only four campaign medals rather than twenty one  He was never recorded as being injured or wounded in combat and so never received a Purple Heart  Most of his military service was spent ashore in the continental United States on administrative or training duties  He served for a short time in Australia but was sent home after quarreling with his superiors  He briefly commanded two anti submarine vessels  the USS YP 422 and USS PC 815  in coastal waters off Massachusetts  Oregon and California in 1942 and 1943 respectively   After Hubbard reported that the PC 815 had attacked and crippled or sunk two Japanese submarines off Oregon in May 1943  his claim was rejected by the commander of the Northwest Sea Frontier  Hubbard and Thomas Moulton  his second in command on the PC 815  later said the Navy wanted to avoid panic on the mainland  A month later Hubbard unwittingly sailed the PC 815 into Mexican territorial waters and conducted gunnery practice off the Coronado Islands  in the belief that they were uninhabited and belonged to the United States  The Mexican government complained and Hubbard was relieved of command  A fitness report written after the incident rated Hubbard as unsuitable for independent duties and  lacking in the essential qualities of judgment  leadership and cooperation   He served for a while as the Navigation and Training Officer for the USS Algol while it was based at Portland  A fitness report from this period recommended promotion  describing him as  a capable and energetic officer   but  very temperamental   and an  above average navigator   However  he never held another such position and did not serve aboard another ship after the Algol   Hubbard s war service has great significance in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology  as he is said to have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics  According to Moulton  Hubbard told him that he had been machine gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies  Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well  either  by the flash of a large caliber gun  or when he had  a bomb go off in my face   Scientology texts say that he returned from the war   b linded with injured optic nerves  and lame with physical injuries to hip and back  and was twice pronounced dead   His medical records state that he was hospitalized with an acute duodenal ulcer rather than a war injury  He told his doctors that he was suffering from lameness caused by a hip infection and he told Look magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from  ulcers  conjunctivitis  deteriorating eyesight  bursitis and something wrong with my feet   He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains  which had given him  continuous trouble  for eight years  especially when  under nervous stress   This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide  a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life  including allergies  arthritis  ulcers and heart problems    The Church of Scientology says that Hubbard s key breakthrough in the development of Dianetics was made at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland  California  According to the Church   An October 1945 Naval Board found that Hubbard was  considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore  preferably within the continental United States   He was discharged from hospital on December 4  1945  and transferred to inactive duty on February 17  1946  He resigned his commission with effect from October 30  1950  The Church of Scientology says he quit because the U S  Navy  attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project  to make man more suggestible  and when he was unwilling  tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function  Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap   The Navy said in a statement in 1980   There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty    The Church disputes the official record of Hubbard s naval career  It asserts that the records are incomplete and perhaps falsified  to conceal Hubbard s secret activities as an intelligence officer   In 1990 the Church provided the Los Angeles Times with a document that was said to be a copy of Hubbard s official record of service  The U S  Navy told the Times that  its contents are not supported by Hubbard s personnel record   The New Yorker reported in February 2011 that the Scientology document was considered by federal archivists to be a forgery   5  Occult involvement in Pasadena  Hubbard s life underwent a turbulent period immediately after the war  According to his own account  he  was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless cripple and a probable burden upon them for the rest of my days   His daughter Katherine presented a rather different version  his wife had refused to uproot their children from their home in Bremerton  Washington  to join him in California  Their marriage was by now in terminal difficulties and he chose to stay in California   In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John  Jack  Whiteside Parsons  A leading rocket propulsion researcher at the California Institute of Technology and a founder of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Parsons led a double life as an avid occultist and Thelemite  follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley s magical order  Ordo Templi Orientis  OTO   He let rooms in the house only to tenants who he specified should be  atheists and those of a Bohemian disposition    Hubbard befriended Parsons and soon became sexually involved with Parsons s 21 year old girlfriend  Sara  Betty  Northrup  Despite this Parsons was very impressed with Hubbard and reported to Crowley   Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the  Babalon Working   a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon  the supreme Thelemite Goddess  It was undertaken over several nights in February and March 1946 in order to summon an  elemental  who would participate in further sex magic  As Richard Metzger describes it   The  elemental  arrived a few days later in the form of Marjorie Cameron  who agreed to participate in Parsons  rites  Soon afterwards  Parsons  Hubbard and Sara agreed to set up a business partnership   Allied Enterprises   in which they invested nearly their entire savings—the vast majority contributed by Parsons  The plan was for Hubbard and Sara to buy yachts in Miami and sail them to the West Coast to sell for a profit  Hubbard had a different idea  he wrote to the U S  Navy requesting permission to leave the country  to visit Central & South America & China  for the purposes of  collecting writing material —in other words  undertaking a world cruise  Aleister Crowley strongly criticized Parsons s actions  writing   Suspect Ron playing confidence trick—Jack Parsons weak fool—obvious victim prowling swindlers   Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets  They attempted to sail anyway but were forced back to port by a storm  A week later  Allied Enterprises was dissolved  Parsons received only a $2 900 promissory note from Hubbard and returned home  shattered   He had to sell his mansion to developers soon afterwards to recoup his losses   Hubbard s fellow writers were well aware of what had happened between him and Parsons  L  Sprague de Camp wrote to Isaac Asimov on August 27  1946  to tell him   Scientology accounts do not mention Hubbard s involvement in occultism  He is instead described as  continu ing  to write to help support his research  during this period into  the development of a means to better the condition of man   The Church of Scientology has nonetheless acknowledged Hubbard s involvement with the OTO  a 1969 statement  written by Hubbard himself  said   The Church of Scientology says Hubbard was  sent in  by his fellow science fiction author Robert Heinlein   who was running off book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time   However  Heinlein s authorized biographer has said that he looked into the matter at the suggestion of Scientologists but found nothing to corroborate claims that Heinlein had been involved  and his biography of Heinlein makes no mention of the matter   On August 10  1946  Hubbard bigamously married Sara  while still married to Polly  It was not until 1947 that his first wife learned that he had remarried  Hubbard agreed to divorce Polly in June that year and the marriage was dissolved shortly afterwards  with Polly given custody of the children   6  Origins of Dianetics  After Hubbard s wedding to Sara  the couple settled at Laguna Beach  California  where Hubbard took a short term job looking after a friend s yacht before resuming his fiction writing to supplement the small disability allowance that he was receiving as a war veteran  Working from a trailer in a run down area of North Hollywood  Hubbard sold a number of science fiction stories that included his Ole Doc Methuselah series and the serialized novels The End Is Not Yet and To the Stars  However  he remained short of money and his son  L  Ron Hubbard Jr  testified later that Hubbard was dependent on his own father and Margaret s parents for money and his writings  which he was paid at a penny per word  never garnered him any more than $10 000 prior to the founding of Scientology  He repeatedly wrote to the Veterans Administration  VA  asking for an increase in his war pension  In October 1947 he wrote   The VA eventually did increase his pension  but his money problems continued  On August 31  1948  he was arrested in San Luis Obispo  California  and subsequently pled guilty to a charge of petty theft  for which he was ordered to pay a $25 fine  According to the Church of Scientology  around this time he  accept ed  an appointment as a Special Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and us ed  the position to study society s criminal elements  and also  worked with neurotics from the Hollywood film community    Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948   Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous  If a man really wants to make a million dollars  the best way would be to start his own religion    In late 1948 Hubbard and Sara moved to Savannah  Georgia  Here  Scientology sources say  he  volunteer ed  his time in hospitals and mental wards  saving the lives of patients with his counseling techniques   Hubbard began to make the first public mentions of what was to become Dianetics  He wrote in January 1949 that he was working on a  book of psychology  about  the cause and cure of nervous tension   which he was going to call The Dark Sword  Excalibur or Science of the Mind  In April 1949  Hubbard wrote to several professional organizations to offer his research  None were interested  so he turned to his editor John W  Campbell  who was more receptive due to a long standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers   psionics   that  permeated both his fiction and non fiction    Campbell invited Hubbard and Sara to move into a cottage at Bay Head  New Jersey  not far from his own home at Plainfield  In July 1949  Campbell recruited an acquaintance  Dr  Joseph Winter  to help develop Hubbard s new therapy of  Dianetics   Campbell told Winter   Hubbard collaborated with Campbell and Winter to refine his techniques  testing them on science fiction fans recruited by Campbell  The basic principle of Dianetics was that the brain recorded every experience and event in a person s life  even when unconscious  Bad or painful experiences were stored as what he called  engrams  in a  reactive mind   These could be triggered later in life  causing emotional and physical problems  By carrying out a process he called  auditing   a person could be regressed through his engrams to re experiencing past experiences  This enabled engrams to be  cleared   The subject  who would now be in a state of  Clear   would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved IQ and photographic memory  The  Clear  would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold  which Hubbard asserted were purely psychosomatic   Winter submitted a paper on Dianetics to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Psychiatry but both journals rejected it  Hubbard and his collaborators decided to announce Dianetics in Campbell s Astounding Science Fiction instead  In an editorial  Campbell said   Its power is almost unbelievable  it proves the mind not only can but does rule the body completely  following the sharply defined basic laws set forth  physical ills such as ulcers  asthma and arthritis can be cured  as can all other psychosomatic ills   The birth of Hubbard s second daughter Alexis Valerie  delivered by Winter on March 8  1950  came in the middle of the preparations to launch Dianetics  A  Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation  was established in April 1950 in Elizabeth  New Jersey  with Hubbard  Sara  Winter and Campbell on the board of directors  Dianetics was duly launched in Astounding s May 1950 issue and on May 9  Hubbard s companion book Dianetics  The Modern Science of Mental Health was published   7  From Dianetics to Scientology  Hubbard called Dianetics  a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and the arch   It was an immediate commercial success and sparked what Martin Gardner calls  a nation wide cult of incredible proportions   By August 1950  Hubbard s book had sold 55 000 copies  was selling at the rate of 4 000 a week and was being translated into French  German and Japanese  Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups had been set up across the United States   Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions  The American Psychological Association criticized Hubbard s claims as  not supported by empirical evidence   Scientific American said that Hubbard s book contained  more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing   while The New Republic called it a  bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense  taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy  newly invented terminology   Some of Hubbard s fellow science fiction writers also criticized it  Isaac Asimov considered it  gibberish  while Jack Williamson called it  a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology    Several famous individuals became involved with Dianetics  Aldous Huxley received auditing from Hubbard himself  the poet Jean Toomer and the science fiction writers Theodore Sturgeon and A  E  van Vogt became trained Dianetics auditors  Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became the head of the newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation  Other branches were established in New York  Washington  D C   Chicago  and Honolulu   Although Dianetics was not cheap  a great many people were nonetheless willing to pay  van Vogt later recalled  doing little but tear open envelopes and pull out $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor s course   Financial controls were lax  Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it  On one occasion  van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56 000  equivalent to $0 5 million at 2010 prices  out of the Los Angeles Foundation s proceeds  One of Hubbard s employees  Helen O Brien  commented that at the Elizabeth  N J  branch of the Foundation  the books showed that  a month s income of $90 000 is listed  with only $20 000 accounted for    Hubbard played a very active role in the Dianetics boom  writing  lecturing and training auditors  Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma  Jack Horner  who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950  later said   He was very impressive  dedicated and amusing  The man had tremendous charisma  you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom   Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how  at a dinner party  he  Robert Heinlein  L  Sprague de Camp and their wives  all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard  He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs   As Atack comments  he was  a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him   Christopher Evans described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology   Hubbard s supporters soon began to have doubts about Dianetics  Winter became disillusioned and wrote that he had never seen a single convincing Clear   I have seen some individuals who are supposed to have been  clear   but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state  Moreover  an individual supposed to have been  clear  has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis   He also deplored the Foundation s omission of any serious scientific research  Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6 000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles failed disastrously  He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall  However  Gardner writes   in the demonstration that followed  she failed to remember a single formula in physics  the subject in which she was majoring  or the color of Hubbard s tie when his back was turned  At this point  a large part of the audience got up and left    Hubbard also faced other practitioners moving into leadership positions within the Dianetics community  It was structured as an open  public practice in which others were free to pursue their own lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard s  The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard s ideas with a wide variety of esoteric and even occult practices  By late 1950  the Elizabeth  N J  Foundation was in financial crisis and the Los Angeles Foundation was more than $200 000 in debt  Winter and Art Ceppos  the publisher of Hubbard s book  resigned under acrimonious circumstances  Campbell also resigned  criticizing Hubbard for being impossible to work with  and blamed him for the disorganization and financial ruin of the Foundations  By the summer of 1951  the Elizabeth  N J  Foundation and all of its branches had closed   The collapse of Hubbard s marriage to Sara created yet more problems  He had begun an affair with his 20 year old public relations assistant in late 1950  while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister  Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the FBI in March 1951  portraying them in a letter as communist infiltrators  According to Hubbard  Sara was  currently intimate with  communists  but evidently under coercion  Drug addiction set in fall 1950  Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago   Hollister was described as having a  sharp chin  broad forehead  rather Slavic   He was said to be the  center of most turbulence in our organization  and  active and dangerous   The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously  an agent annotated his correspondence with the comment   Appears mental    Three weeks later  Hubbard and two Foundation staff seized Sara and his year old daughter Alexis and forcibly took them to San Bernardino  California  where he attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane  He let Sara go but took Alexis to Havana  Cuba  Sara filed a divorce suit on April 23  1951  that accused him of marrying her bigamously and subjecting her to sleep deprivation  beatings  strangulation  kidnapping and exhortations to commit suicide  The case led to newspaper headlines such as  Ron Hubbard Insane  Says His Wife   Sara finally secured the return of her daughter in June 1951 by agreeing to a settlement with her husband in which she signed a statement  written by him  declaring   Dianetics appeared to be on the edge of total collapse  However  it was saved by Don Purcell  a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in Wichita  Kansas  Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics  The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth  N J  The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952  Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the American Medical Association to destroy Dianetics  Hubbard established a  Hubbard College  on the other side of town where he continued to promote Dianetics while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation s intellectual property   Only six weeks after setting up the Hubbard College and marrying a staff member  18 year old Mary Sue Whipp  Hubbard closed it down and moved with his new bride to Phoenix  Arizona  He established a Hubbard Association of Scientologists International to promote his new  Science of Certainty —Scientology   8  Rise of Scientology  The Church of Scientology attributes its genesis to Hubbard s discovery of  a new line of research   first set out in his book Science of Survival— that man is most fundamentally a spiritual being   Non Scientologist writers have suggested alternative motives  that he aimed  to reassert control over his creation   that he believed  he was about to lose control of Dianetics   or that he wanted to ensure  he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to     the hated Don Purcell    Hubbard expanded upon the basics of Dianetics to construct a spiritually oriented  though at this stage not religious  doctrine based on the concept that the true self of a person was a thetan—an immortal  omniscient and potentially omnipotent entity  Hubbard taught that the thetans  having created the material universe  had forgotten their god like powers and become trapped in physical bodies  Scientology aimed to  rehabilitate  each person s thetan to restore its original capacities and become once again an  Operating Thetan   Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by the forces of  aberration   which were the result of engrams carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years   Hubbard introduced a device called an E meter that he presented as having  as Miller puts it   an almost mystical power to reveal an individual s innermost thoughts   He promulgated Scientology through a series of lectures  bulletins and books such as A History of Man   a cold blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years   and Scientology  8 8008   With this book  the ability to make one s body old or young at will  the ability to heal the ill without physical contact  the ability to cure the insane and the incapacitated  is set forth for the physician  the layman  the mathematician and the physicist     Scientology was organized in a very different way from the decentralized Dianetics movement  The Hubbard Association of Scientologists  HAS  was the only official Scientology organization  Training procedures and doctrines were standardized and promoted through HAS publications  and administrators and auditors were not permitted to deviate from Hubbard s approach  Branches or  orgs  were organized as franchises  rather like a fast food restaurant chain  Each franchise holder was required to pay ten percent of income to Hubbard s central organization  They were expected to find new recruits  known as  raw meat   but were restricted to providing only basic services  Costlier higher level auditing was only provided by Hubbard s central organization   Although this model would eventually be extremely successful  Scientology was a very small scale movement at first  Hubbard started off with only a few dozen followers  generally dedicated Dianeticists  a seventy hour series of lectures in Philadelphia in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people  Hubbard was joined in Phoenix by his 18 year old son Nibs  who had been unable to settle down in high school  Nibs had decided to become a Scientologist  moved into his father s home and went on to become a Scientology staff member and  professor   Hubbard also traveled to the United Kingdom to establish his control over a Dianetics group in London  It was very much a shoestring operation  as Helen O Brien later recalled   there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all  At 163 Holland Park Avenue was an ill lit lecture room and a bare boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet—mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women   On September 24  1952  only a few weeks after arriving in London  Hubbard s wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child  a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard   In February 1953  Hubbard acquired a doctorate from the unaccredited Sequoia University  According to a Scientology biography  this was  given in recognition of his outstanding work on Dianetics  and  as an inspiration to the many people     who had been inspired by him to take up advanced studies in this field      The British government concluded in the 1970s that Sequoia University was a  degree mill  operated by Joseph Hough  a Los Angeles chiropractor  Miller cites a telegram sent by Hubbard on February 27  1953  in which he instructed Scientologist Richard de Mille to procure him a Ph D  from Hough urgently— FOR GOSH SAKES EXPEDITE  WORK HERE UTTERLY DEPENDANT ON IT   Hough s  university  was closed down by the Californian authorities in 1971  British government officials noted in a report written in 1977   It has not and never had any authority whatsoever to issue diplomas or degrees and the dean is sought by the authorities  for questioning     A few weeks after becoming  Dr   Hubbard  he wrote to Helen O Brien—who had taken over the day to day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion  As membership declined and finances grew tighter  Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics  His letter to O Brien discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status  The idea may not have been new  Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948   Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous  If a man really wants to make a million dollars  the best way would be to start his own religion   The Church of Scientology has denied that Hubbard said this and insists that it is a misattributed quote that was said instead by George Orwell  although they offer no proof of this claim  Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of  Spiritual Guidance Centers  charging customers $500 for twenty four hours of auditing   That is real money     Charge enough and we d be swamped     He wrote   O Brien was not enthusiastic and resigned the following September  worn out by work  She criticized Hubbard for creating  a temperate zone voodoo  in its inelasticity  unexplainable procedures  and mindless group euphoria   He nonetheless pressed ahead and on December 18  1953  he incorporated the Church of Scientology  Church of American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering in Camden  New Jersey  Hubbard  his wife Mary Sue and his secretary John Galusha became the trustees of all three corporations  Hubbard later denied founding the Church of Scientology  and to this day  Scientologists maintain that the  founding church  was actually the Church of Scientology of California  established on February 18  1954  by Scientologist Burton Farber  The reason for Scientology s religious transformation was explained by officials of the HAS   Scientology franchises became Churches of Scientology and some auditors began dressing as clergymen  complete with clerical collars  If they were arrested in the course of their activities  Hubbard advised  they should sue for massive damages for molesting  a Man of God going about his business   A few years later he told Scientologists   If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization  always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace     Don t ever defend  always attack   Any individual breaking away from Scientology and setting up his own group was to be shut down   The 1950s saw Scientology growing steadily  Hubbard finally achieved victory over Don Purcell in 1954 when the latter  worn out by constant litigation  handed the copyrights of Dianetics back to Hubbard  Most of the formerly independent Scientology and Dianetics groups were either driven out of business or were absorbed into Hubbard s organizations  Hubbard marketed Scientology through medical claims  such as attracting polio sufferers by presenting the Church of Scientology as a scientific research foundation investigating polio cases  One advertisement during this period stated   Scientology became a highly profitable enterprise for Hubbard  He implemented a scheme under which he was paid a percentage of the Church of Scientology s gross income and by 1957 he was being paid about $250 000 annually—equivalent to $1 9 million at 2010 prices  His family grew  too  with Mary Sue giving birth to three more children—Geoffrey Quentin McCaully on January 6  1954  Mary Suzette Rochelle on February 13  1955  and Arthur Ronald Conway on June 6  1958  In the spring of 1959  he used his new found wealth to purchase Saint Hill Manor  an 18th century country house in Sussex  formerly owned by Sawai Man Singh II  the Maharaja of Jaipur  The house became Hubbard s permanent residence and an international training center for Scientologists   9  Controversies and crises  By the start of the 1960s  Hubbard was the leader of a worldwide movement with thousands of followers  A decade later  however  he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy   The Church of Scientology says that the problems of this period were due to  vicious  covert international attacks  by the United States government   all of which were proven false and baseless  which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750 million dollars for conspiracy   Behind the attacks  stated Hubbard  lay a vast conspiracy of  psychiatric front groups  secretly controlling governments   Every single lie  false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group s members  They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind  They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field    Hubbard believed that Scientology was being infiltrated by saboteurs and spies and introduced  security checking  to identify those he termed  potential trouble sources  and  suppressive persons   Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E meters and were asked questions such as  Have you ever practiced homosexuality   and  Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L  Ron Hubbard   For a time  Scientologists were even interrogated about crimes committed in past lives   Have you ever destroyed a culture    Did you come to Earth for evil purposes    Have you ever zapped anyone    He also sought to exert political influence  advising Scientologists to vote against Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election and establishing a Department of Government Affairs  to bring government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology   This  he said   is done by high level ability to control and in its absence by a low level ability to overwhelm  Introvert such agencies  Control such agencies    The U S  Government was already well aware of Hubbard s activities  The FBI had a lengthy file on him  including a 1951 interview with an agent who considered him a  mental case   Police forces in a number of jurisdictions began exchanging information about Scientology through the auspices of Interpol  which eventually led to prosecutions  In 1958  the U S  Internal Revenue Service withdrew the Washington  D C  Church of Scientology s tax exemption after it found that Hubbard and his family were profiting unreasonably from Scientology s ostensibly non profit income  The Food and Drug Administration took action against Scientology s medical claims  seizing thousands of pills being marketed as  radiation cures  as well as publications and E meters  The Church of Scientology was required to label them as being  ineffective in the diagnosis or treatment of disease    Following the FDA s actions  Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English speaking world  It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in Victoria  Australia  where it was accused of brainwashing  blackmail  extortion and damaging the mental health of its members  The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963  Its report  published in October 1965  condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself  He was described as being of doubtful sanity  having a persecution complex and displaying strong indications of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur  His writings were characterized as nonsensical  abounding in  self glorification and grandiosity  replete with histrionics and hysterical  incontinent outbursts   Sociologist Roy Wallis comments that the report drastically changed public perceptions of Scientology   The report led to Scientology being banned in Victoria  Western Australia and South Australia  and led to more negative publicity around the world  Newspapers and politicians in the UK pressed the British government for action against Scientology  In April 1966  hoping to form a remote  safe haven  for Scientology  Hubbard traveled to the southern African country Rhodesia  today Zimbabwe  and looked into setting up a base there at a hotel on Lake Kariba  Despite his attempts to curry favour with the local government—he personally delivered champagne to Prime Minister Ian Smith s house  but Smith refused to see him—Rhodesia promptly refused to renew Hubbard s visa  compelling him to leave the country  In July 1968  the British Minister of Health  Kenneth Robinson  announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the UK and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an  undesirable alien   Further inquiries were launched in Canada  New Zealand and South Africa   Hubbard took three major new initiatives in the face of these challenges   Ethics Technology  was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology  It required Scientologists to  disconnect  from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or  suppressive   Scientologists were also required to write  Knowledge Reports  on each other  reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods  Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable  Misdemeanors    Crimes   and  High Crimes   The  Fair Game  policy was introduced  which was applicable to anyone deemed an  enemy  of Scientology   May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist  May be tricked  sued or lied to or destroyed    At the start of March 1966  Hubbard created the Guardian s Office  GO   a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue  It dealt with Scientology s external affairs  including public relations  legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats  As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention  the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander  it issued more than forty on a single day  Hubbard ordered his staff to find  lurid  blood sex crime actual evidence on  Scientology s  attackers    Finally  at the end of 1966  Hubbard acquired his own fleet of ships  He established the  Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd  which purchased three ships—the Enchanter  a forty ton schooner  the Avon River  an old trawler  and the Royal Scotman   a former Irish Sea cattle ferry that he made his home and flagship  The ships were crewed by the Sea Organization or  Sea Org   a group of Scientologist volunteers  with the support of a couple of professional seamen   10  Commodore of the Sea Org  After Hubbard created the Sea Org  fleet  in early 1967 it began an eight year voyage  sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic  The fleet traveled as far as Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean and Dakar and the Azores in the Atlantic  but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks  Ken Urquhart  Hubbard s personal assistant at the time  later recalled   When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities  According to Miller  this was not true  He received daily telex messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income  The Church of Scientology sent him $15 000 a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein  Couriers arrived regularly  conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions   Along the way  Hubbard sought to establish a safe haven in  a friendly little country where Scientology would be allowed to prosper   as Miller puts it  The fleet stayed at Corfu for several months in 1968–1969  Hubbard renamed the ships after Greek gods—the Royal Scotman was rechristened Apollo—and he praised the recently established military dictatorship  The Sea Org was represented as  Professor Hubbard s Philosophy School  in a telegram to the Greek government  In March 1969  however  Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave  In mid 1972  Hubbard tried again in Morocco  establishing contacts with the country s secret police and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives  The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics  and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972   At the same time  Hubbard was still developing Scientology s doctrines  A Scientology biography states that  free of organizational duties and aided by the first Sea Org members  L  Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the physical universe some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time   In 1965  he designated several existing Scientology courses as confidential  repackaging them as the first of the esoteric  OT levels   Two years later he announced the release of OT3  the  Wall of Fire   revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred  on this planet  and on the other seventy five planets which form this Confederacy  seventy five million years ago   Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how Xenu  the leader of the Galactic Confederacy  had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with hydrogen bombs  following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at  implant stations   brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings  The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard  who announced that he had broken a knee  an arm  and his back during the course of his research  A year later  in 1968  he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the Royal Scotman   Scientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet  What they found was rather different from the image  Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all  Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near disasters  Following one incident in which the rudder of the Royal Scotman was damaged during a storm  Hubbard ordered the ship s entire crew to be reduced to a  condition of liability  and wear gray rags tied to their arms  The ship itself was treated the same way  with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status  According to those aboard  conditions were appalling  the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion  given meagre rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks  Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet  punishing mistakes by confining people in the Royal Scotman bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets  At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and  occasionally  filming  David Mayo  a Sea Org member at the time  later recalled   From about 1970  Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members  organized as the Commodore s Messenger Organization  CMO   They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops  who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes  dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew  In addition to his wife Mary Sue  he was accompanied by all four of his children by her  though not his first son Nibs  who had defected from Scientology in late 1959  The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors  though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid 1974   11  Life in hiding  During the 1970s  Hubbard faced an increasing number of legal threats  French prosecutors charged him and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations in 1972  He was advised that he was at risk of being extradited to France  Hubbard left the Sea Org fleet temporarily at the end of 1972  living incognito in Queens  New York  until he returned to his flagship in September 1973 when the threat of extradition had abated  Scientology sources say that he carried out  a sociological study in and around New York City    Hubbard s health deteriorated significantly during this period  A chain smoker  he also suffered from bursitis and excessive weight  and had a prominent growth on his forehead  He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and had a heart attack in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant drugs for the next year  In September 1978  Hubbard had a pulmonary embolism  falling into a coma  but recovered   He remained active in managing and developing Scientology  establishing the controversial Rehabilitation Project Force in 1974 and issuing policy and doctrinal bulletins  However  the Sea Org s voyages were coming to an end  The Apollo was banned from several Spanish ports and was expelled from Curaçao in October 1975  The Sea Org came to be suspected of being a CIA operation  leading to a riot in Funchal  Madeira  when the Apollo docked there  At the time  The Apollo Stars  a musical group founded by Hubbard and made up entirely of shipbound members of the Sea Org  was offering free on pier concerts in an attempt to promote Scientology  and the riot occurred at one of these events  Hubbard decided to relocate back to the United States to establish a  land base  for the Sea Org in Florida  The Church of Scientology attributes this decision to the activities on the Apollo having  outgrow n  the ship s capacity    In October 1975  Hubbard moved into a hotel suite in Daytona Beach  The Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater  Florida  was secretly acquired as the location for the  land base   On December 5  1975  Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue moved into a condominium complex in nearby Dunedin  Their presence was meant to be a closely guarded secret but was accidentally compromised the following month  Hubbard immediately left Dunedin and moved to Georgetown  Washington  D C   accompanied by a handful of aides and messengers  but not his wife  Six months later  following another security alert in July 1976  Hubbard moved to another safe house in Culver City  California  He lived there for only about three months  relocating in October to the more private confines of the Olive Tree Ranch near La Quinta  His second son Quentin committed suicide a few weeks later in Las Vegas   Throughout this period  Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian s Office  GO   the legal bureau intelligence agency that he had established in 1966  He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international Nazi conspiracy  which he termed the  Tenyaka Memorial   through a network of drug companies  banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world  In 1973  he instigated the  Snow White Program  and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources  The GO was ordered to  get all false and secret files on Scientology  LRH      that cannot be obtained legally  by all possible lines of approach     i e   job penetration  janitor penetration  suitable guises utilizing covers   His involvement in the GO s operations was concealed through the use of codenames  The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as Operation Bulldozer Leak  intended  to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government  media  and individual Suppressive Persons to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity   He was kept informed of GO operations  such as the theft of medical records from a hospital  harassment of psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various times  such as the Better Business Bureau  the American Medical Association  and American Psychiatric Association   Members of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations  including the U S  Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service  After two GO agents were caught in the Washington  D C  headquarters of the IRS  the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on GO offices in Los Angeles and Washington  D C  on July 7  1977  They retrieved wiretap equipment  burglary tools and some 90 000 pages of incriminating documents  Hubbard was not prosecuted  though he was labeled an  unindicted co conspirator  by government prosecutors  His wife Mary Sue was indicted and subsequently convicted of conspiracy  She was sent to a federal prison along with ten other Scientologists   Hubbard s troubles increased in February 1978 when a French court convicted him in absentia for obtaining money under false pretenses  He was sentenced to four years in prison and a 35 000FF  $7 000  fine  He went into hiding in April 1979  moving to an apartment in Hemet  California  where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers  He cut contact with everyone else  even his wife  whom he saw for the last time in August 1979  Hubbard faced a possible indictment for his role in Operation Freakout  the GO s campaign against New York journalist Paulette Cooper  and in February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers  Pat and Anne Broeker   For the first few years of the 1980s  Hubbard and the Broekers lived on the move  touring the Pacific Northwest in a recreational vehicle and living for a while in apartments in Newport Beach and Los Angeles  Hubbard used his time in hiding to write his first new works of science fiction for nearly thirty years—Battlefield Earth  1982  and Mission Earth  a ten volume series published between 1985 and 1987  They received mixed responses  as writer Jeff Walker puts it  they were  treated derisively by most critics but greatly admired by followers   Hubbard also wrote and composed music for three of his albums  which were produced by the Church of Scientology  The book soundtrack Space Jazz was released in 1982  Mission Earth and The Road to Freedom were released posthumously in 1986   In Hubbard s absence  members of the Sea Org staged a takeover of the Church of Scientology and purged many veteran Scientologists  A young Messenger  David Miscavige  became Scientology s de facto leader  Mary Sue Hubbard was forced to resign her position and her daughter Suzette became Miscavige s personal maid   12  Death and legacy  For the last two years of his life  Hubbard lived in a luxury Blue Bird motorhome on Whispering Winds  a 160 acre ranch near Creston  California  He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so  where  He spent his time  writing and researching   according to a spokesperson  and pursued photography and music  overseeing construction work and checking on his animals  He repeatedly redesigned the property  spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter mile horse racing track with an observation tower  which reportedly was never used   He was still closely involved in managing the Church of Scientology via secretly delivered orders and continued to receive large amounts of money  of which Forbes magazine estimated  at least $200 million  was  gathered in Hubbard s name through 1982   In September 1985  the IRS notified the Church that it was considering indicting Hubbard for tax fraud   Hubbard suffered further ill health  including chronic pancreatitis  during his residence at Whispering Winds  He suffered a stroke on January 17  1986  and died a week later  His body was cremated following an autopsy and the ashes were scattered at sea  Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to  drop his body  to continue his research on another planet  having  learned how to do it without a body    Hubbard was survived by his wife Mary Sue and all of his children except his second son Quentin  His will provided a trust fund to support Mary Sue  her children Arthur  Diana and Suzette  and Katherine  the daughter of his first wife Polly  He disinherited two of his other children  L  Ron Hubbard  Jr  had become estranged  changed his name to  Ronald DeWolf  and  in 1982  sued unsuccessfully for control of his father s estate  Alexis Valerie  Hubbard s daughter by his second wife Sara  had attempted to contact her father in 1971  She was rebuffed with the implied claim that her real father was Jack Parsons rather than Hubbard  and that her mother had been a Nazi spy during the war  Both later accepted settlements when litigation was threatened  In 2001  Diana and Suzette were reported to still be Church members  while Arthur had left and become an artist  Hubbard s great grandson  Jamie DeWolf  is a noted slam poet   The copyrights of his works and much of his estate and wealth were willed to the Church of Scientology  In a bulletin dated May 5  1980  Hubbard told his followers to preserve his teachings until an eventual reincarnation when he would return  not as a religious leader but as a political one   The Church of Spiritual Technology  CST   a sister organization of the Church of Scientology  has engraved Hubbard s entire corpus of Scientology and Dianetics texts on steel tablets stored in titanium containers  They are buried at the Trementina Base in a vault under a mountain near Trementina  New Mexico  on top of which the CST s logo has been bulldozed on such a gigantic scale that it is visible from space   Hubbard is the Guinness World Record holder for the most published author  with 1 084 works  most translated book  70 languages for The Way to Happiness  and most audiobooks  185 as of April 2009   According to Galaxy Press  Hubbard s Battlefield Earth has sold over 6 million copies and Mission Earth a further 7 million  with each of its ten volumes becoming New York Times bestsellers on their release  however  in 1990 the Los Angeles Times reported in 1990 that Hubbard s followers had been buying large numbers of the books and re issuing them to stores  so as to boost sales figures  Opinions are divided about his literary legacy  Scientologists have written of their desire to  make Ron the most acclaimed and widely known author of all time   The sociologist William Sims Bainbridge writes that even at his peak in the late 1930s Hubbard was regarded by readers of Astounding Science Fiction as merely  a passable  familiar author but not one of the best   while by the late 1970s  the  science fiction  subculture wishes it could forget him  and fans gave him a worse rating than any other of the  Golden Age  writers   In 2004  eighteen years after Hubbard s death  the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide  According to religious scholar J  Gordon Melton  this is an overestimate  counting as Scientologists people who had merely bought a book  The City University of New York s American Religious Identification Survey found that by 2009 only 25 000 Americans identified as Scientologists  Hubbard s presence still pervades Scientology  Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard  with a desk  chair and writing equipment  ready to be used  Lonnie D  Kliever notes that Hubbard was  the only source of the religion  and he has no successor   Hubbard is referred to simply as  Source  within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard s doctrines  Hubbard s name and signature are official trademarks of the Religious Technology Center  established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard s works and Scientology s trademarks and copyrights  The RTC is the central organization within Scientology s complex corporate hierarchy and has put much effort into re checking the accuracy of all Scientology publications to  ensur e  the availability of the pure unadulterated writings of Mr  Hubbard to the coming generations   The Danish historian of religions Mikael Rothstein describes Scientology as  a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard   He comments   The fact that  Hubbard s  life is mythologized is as obvious as in the cases of Jesus  Muhammad or Siddartha Gotama  This is how religion works  Scientology  however  rejects this analysis altogether  and goes to great lengths to defend every detail of Hubbard s amazing and fantastic life as plain historical fact   Hubbard is presented as  the master of a multitude of disciplines  who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer  composer  scientist  therapist  explorer  navigator  philosopher  poet  artist  humanitarian  adventurer  soldier  scout  musician and many other fields of endeavor  The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard s life and work as having proceeded seamlessly   as if they were a continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research  even up to and beyond his death   According to Rothstein s assessment of Hubbard s legacy  Scientology consciously aims to transfer the charismatic authority of Hubbard to institutionalize his authority over the organization  even after his death  Hubbard is presented as a virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history  As Rothstein puts it   reverence for Scientology s scripture is reverence for Hubbard  the man who in the Scientological perspective single handedly brought salvation to all human beings   David G  Bromley of the University of Virginia comments that the real Hubbard has been transformed into a  prophetic persona    LRH   which acts as the basis for his prophetic authority within Scientology and transcends his biographical history   13  Biographies  Following Hubbard s death  Bridge Publications has published several stand alone biographical accounts of his life  Marco Frenschkowski notes that  non Scientologist readers immediately recognize some parts of Hubbard s life are here systematically left out  no information whatsoever is given about his private life  his marriages  divorces  children   his legal affairs and so on   The Church maintains an extensive website presenting the official version of Hubbard s life  It also owns a number of properties dedicated to Hubbard including the Los Angeles based L  Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition  a presentation of Hubbard s life  and the Author Services Center  dedicated to Hubbard s writings  and the L  Ron Hubbard House in Washington  D C   In late 2012  Bridge published a comprehensive official biography of Hubbard  titled The L  Ron Hubbard Series  A Biographical Encyclopedia  written primarily by Dan Sherman  the official Hubbard biographer at the time  This series is the most recent official Church of Scientology biography of Hubbard  as published by Bridge Publications  It is a 17 volume series  each focusing on various different aspects of Hubbard s life  from his Music  to photography and other ventures he was involved in  It is advertised as a  Biographic Encyclopedia  and is primarily authored by the official biographer  Dan Sherman   To date  there has not been a single volume comprehensive official biography published During his lifetime  a number of brief biographical sketches were also published in his Scientology books  The Church of Scientology issued  the only authorized LRH Biography  in October 1977 it has since been followed by the Sherman  Biographic Encyclopedia    His life was illustrated in print in What Is Scientology   a glossy publication published in 1978 with paintings of Hubbard s life contributed by his son Arthur   In the late 1970s two men began to assemble a very different picture of Hubbard s life  Michael Linn Shannon  a resident of Portland  Oregon  became interested in Hubbard s life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter  Over the next four years he collected previously undisclosed records and documents  He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher   Shannon s findings were acquired by Gerry Armstrong  a Scientologist who had been appointed Hubbard s official archivist  He had been given the job of assembling documents relating to Hubbard s life for the purpose of helping Omar V  Garrison  a non Scientologist who had written two books sympathetic to Scientology  to write an official biography  However  the documents that he uncovered convinced both Armstrong and Garrison that Hubbard had systematically misrepresented his life  Garrison refused to write a  puff piece  and declared that he would not  repeat all the falsehoods they  the Church of Scientology  had perpetuated over the years   He wrote a  warts and all  biography while Armstrong quit Scientology  taking five boxes of papers with him  The Church of Scientology and Mary Sue Hubbard sued for the return of the documents while settling out of court with Garrison  requiring him to turn over the nearly completed manuscript of the biography  In October 1984 Judge Paul G  Breckenridge ruled in Armstrong s favor  saying   In November 1987  the British journalist and writer Russell Miller published Bare faced Messiah  the first full length biography of L  Ron Hubbard  He drew on Armstrong s papers  official records and interviews with those who had known Hubbard including ex Scientologists and family members  The book was well received by reviewers but the Church of Scientology sought unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication on the grounds of copyright infringement  Other critical biographical accounts are found in Bent Corydon s L  Ron Hubbard  Messiah or Madman   1987  and Jon Atack s A Piece of Blue Sky  1990    14  In popular culture  Hubbard appears as a major character in Paul Malmont s historical novel The Astounding  the Amazing  and the Unknown  2011    15  Bibliography  According to the Church of Scientology  Hubbard produced some 65 million words on Dianetics and Scientology  contained in about 500 000 pages of written material  3 000 recorded lectures and 100 films  His works of fiction included some 500 novels and short stories   16  Notes  17  References  Atack  Jon  A Piece of Blue Sky  Scientology  Dianetics  and L  Ron Hubbard exposed  Carol Publishing Group  1990  ISBN 978 0 8184 0499 3   Behar  Richard Pushing
