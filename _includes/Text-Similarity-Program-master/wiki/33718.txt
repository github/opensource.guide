William Cuthbert Faulkner    September 25  1897 – July 6  1962  was an American writer and Nobel Prize laureate from Oxford  Mississippi  Faulkner wrote novels  short stories  a play  poetry  essays and screenplays  He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County  based on Lafayette County  Mississippi  where he spent most of his life   Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in American literature generally and Southern literature specifically  Though his work was published as early as 1919  and largely during the 1920s and 1930s  Faulkner was relatively unknown until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature  Two of his works  A Fable  1954  and his last novel The Reivers  1962   won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  In 1998  the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English language novels of the 20th century  also on the list were As I Lay Dying  1930  and Light in August  1932   Absalom  Absalom   1936  is often included on similar lists   1  Biography  Faulkner was born William Cuthbert Falkner in New Albany  Mississippi  the first of four sons of Murry Cuthbert Falkner  August 17  1870 – August 7  1932  and Maud Butler  November 27  1871 – October 19  1960   He had three younger brothers  Murry Charles  Jack  Falkner  June 26  1899 – December 24  1975   author John Falkner  September 24  1901 – March 28  1963  and Dean Swift Falkner  August 15  1907 – November 10  1935   Soon after his first birthday  his family moved to Ripley  Mississippi where his father worked as the treasurer for the family owned Gulf & Chicago Railroad Company  Murry hoped to inherit the railroad from his father  John Wesley Thompson Falkner  but John had little confidence in Murry s ability to run a business and sold it for $75 000  Following the sale of the railroad business  Murry became disappointed and planned a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher  Maud  however  disagreed with this proposition  and it was decided that they would move to Oxford  Mississippi  where Murry s father owned several businesses  making it easy for Murry to find work  Thus  four days prior to William s fifth birthday on September 21  1902 the Falkner family settled in Oxford where he lived on and off for the rest of his life   His family  particularly his mother Maud  his maternal grandmother Lelia Butler  and Caroline Barr  the black woman who raised him from infancy  crucially influenced the development of Faulkner s artistic imagination  Both his mother and grandmother were great readers and also painters and photographers  educating him in visual language  While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and taught his sons to hunt  track  and fish  Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church  She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as Charles Dickens and Grimms  Fairy Tales  Faulkner s lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels  preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race   As a schoolchild  Faulkner had much success early on  He excelled in the first grade  skipped the second  and continued doing well through the third and fourth grades  However  beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling  Faulkner became a much more quiet and withdrawn child  He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork  even though he began to study the history of Mississippi on his own time in the seventh grade  The decline of his performance in school continued and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh  and then final grade  and never graduating from high school   Faulkner also spent much of his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders  These included war stories shared by the old men of Oxford and stories told by Mammy Callie of the Civil War  slavery  the Ku Klux Klan  and the Falkner family  Faulkner s grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William s great grandfather  after whom he was named  William Clark Falkner  who was a successful businessman  writer  and a Civil War hero  Telling stories about William Clark Falkner  whom the family called  Old Colonel   had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy  According to one of Faulkner s biographers  by the time William was born  his great grandfather had  been enshrined long since as a household deity    In adolescence  Faulkner began writing poetry almost exclusively  He did not write his first novel until 1925  His literary influences are deep and wide  He once stated that he modeled his early writing on the Romantic era in late 18th century and early 19th century England  He attended the University of Mississippi  Ole Miss  in Oxford  enrolling in 1919  and attended three semesters before dropping out in November 1920  William was able to attend classes at the university due to his father having a job there as a business manager  He skipped classes often and received a  D  grade in English  However  some of his poems were published in campus journals   When he was 17  Faulkner met Philip Stone  who would later become an important early influence on his writing  Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford s older families  He was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor s degrees from Yale and the University of Mississippi  At the University of Mississippi  Faulkner joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity  There he was supported in his dream to become a writer  Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner s early poetry and was one of the first to discover Faulkner s talent and artistic potential  Stone became a literary mentor to the young Faulkner  introducing him to writers such as James Joyce  who would come to have an influence on Faulkner s own writing  In his early twenties  Faulkner would give poems and short stories he had written to Stone  in hopes of them being published  Stone would in turn send these to publishers  but they were uniformly rejected   The younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived  Mississippi marked his sense of humor  his sense of the tragic position of Black and White Americans  his characterization of Southern characters  and his timeless themes  including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the façades of good old boys and simpletons  Unable to join the United States Army due to his height  he was 5  5½    Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the British Armed Forces in Toronto  Despite his claims to have done so  records now available to the public indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British Royal Flying Corps and never saw service during the First World War   In 1918  Faulkner himself made the change to his surname from the original  Falkner   However  according to one story  a careless typesetter simply made an error  When the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book  Faulkner was asked whether he wanted a change  He supposedly replied   Either way suits me   Although Faulkner is heavily identified with Mississippi  he was residing in New Orleans  Louisiana  in 1925 when he wrote his first novel  Soldiers  Pay  after being directly influenced by Sherwood Anderson to attempt fiction writing  Anderson also assisted in the publication of Soldier s Pay and of Mosquitoes  Faulkner s second novel  by recommending them both to his own publisher  The miniature house at 624 Pirate s Alley  just around the corner from St  Louis Cathedral in New Orleans is now the premises of Faulkner House Books  where it also serves as the headquarters of the Pirate s Alley Faulkner Society   During the summer of 1927  Faulkner wrote his first novel set in his fictional Yoknapatawpha County  entitled Flags in the Dust  This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South  in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth  He was very proud of his novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant improvement from his previous two novels  However  when submitted for publication  it was rejected by the publishers Boni & Liveright  This came as a huge shock to Faulkner  but he eventually allowed his literary agent  Ben Wasson  to significantly edit the text and the novel was finally published in 1928 as Sartoris   In the fall of 1928  when Faulkner was thirty years old  he began working on The Sound and the Fury  He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson  but Faulkner soon began to feel that the characters he had created would be better suited for a full length novel  Perhaps as a result of his disappointment in the initial rejection of Flags in the Dust  Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style  In describing his writing process for this work  Faulkner would later say   One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher s addresses and book lists  I said to myself  Now I can write   After its completion  Faulkner this time insisted that Ben Wasson not do any editing or add any punctuation for clarity   In 1929 Faulkner married Estelle Oldham  His best man was Andrew Kuhn  Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to Cornell Franklin and Faulkner intended to support his new family as a writer  Faulkner began writing As I lay Dying in 1929 while working night shifts in the University of Mississippi s boiler room  The novel would be published in 1930  Beginning in 1930  Faulkner sent out some of his short stories to various national magazines  Several of his stories were published and this brought him enough income to buy a house in Oxford for his family to live in  which he named  Rowan Oak    By 1932  however  Faulkner was in a much less secure financial position  He had asked his agent  Ben Wasson to sell the serialization rights for his newly completed novel  Light in August  to a magazine for $5 000  but no magazine accepted the offer  Then  MGM Studios offered Faulkner work as a screenwriter in Hollywood  While Faulkner was not a fan of film  he needed the money  and so he accepted the job offer and arrived in Culver City California in May 1932  There he worked with director Howard Hawks  with whom he got along well  as they both enjoyed drinking and hunting  Howard Hawks  brother William Hawks became Faulkner s Hollywood agent  Faulkner would continue to find work as a screenwriter for years to come throughout the 1930s and 1940s   Faulkner served as Writer in Residence at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville from February to June 1957 and again in 1958  He suffered serious injuries in a horse riding accident in 1959  and died from a myocardial infarction  aged 64  on July 6  1962  at Wright s Sanitorium in Byhalia  Mississippi  He is buried along with his family in St  Peter s Cemetery in Oxford  along with a family friend with the mysterious initials E T   1 1  Personal life  As a teenager in Oxford  Faulkner dated Estelle Oldham  1897–1972   the popular daughter of Major Lemuel and Lida Oldham  and believed he would some day marry her  However  Estelle dated other boys during their romance  and one of them  Cornell Franklin  ended up proposing marriage to her before Faulkner did  in 1918  Estelle s parents insisted she marry Cornell  as he was an Ole Miss law graduate  had recently been commissioned as a major in the Hawaiian Territorial Forces  and came from a respectable family with which they were old friends  Estelle s marriage to Franklin fell apart ten years later  and she was divorced in April 1929  Faulkner married Estelle in June 1929 at College Hill Presbyterian Church just outside of Oxford  Mississippi  They honeymooned on the Mississippi Gulf Coast at Pascagoula  then returned to Oxford  first living with relatives while they searched for a home of their own to purchase  In 1930 Faulkner purchased the antebellum home Rowan Oak  known at that time as  The Shegog Place  from Irish planter Robert Shegog  After his death  Estelle and their daughter  Jill  lived at Rowan Oak until Estelle s death in 1972  The property was sold to the University of Mississippi in 1972  The house and furnishings are maintained much as they were in Faulkner s day  Faulkner s scribblings are still preserved on the wall there  including the day by day outline covering an entire week that he wrote out on the walls of his small study to help him keep track of the plot twists in the novel A Fable   The quality and quantity of Faulkner s literary output were achieved despite a lifelong drinking problem  He rarely drank while writing  preferring instead to binge after a project s completion   Faulkner is known to have had several extramarital affairs  One was with Howard Hawks s secretary and script girl  Meta Carpenter  Another  from 1949–53  was with a young writer  Joan Williams  who made her relationship with Faulkner the subject of her 1971 novel  The Wintering   When Faulkner visited Stockholm in December 1950 to receive the Nobel Prize  he met Else Jonsson  1912–1996  and they had an affair that lasted until the end of 1953  Else was the widow of journalist Thorsten Jonsson  1910–1950   reporter for Dagens Nyheter in New York 1943–1946  who had interviewed Faulkner in 1946 and introduced his works to Swedish readers  At the banquet in 1950 where they met  publisher Tor Bonnier referred to Else as widow of the man responsible for Faulkner being awarded the prize   2  Writing  From the early 1920s to the outbreak of World War II  when he left for California  Faulkner published 13 novels and many short stories  Such a body of work formed the basis of his reputation and led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize at age 52  Faulkner s prodigious output  mainly driven by an obscure writer s need for money  includes his most celebrated novels such as The Sound and the Fury  1929   As I Lay Dying  1930   Light in August  1932   and Absalom  Absalom   1936   Faulkner was also a prolific writer of short stories   His first short story collection  These 13  1931   includes many of his most acclaimed  and most frequently anthologized  stories  including  A Rose for Emily    Red Leaves    That Evening Sun   and  Dry September   Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in Yoknapatawpha County—based on  and nearly geographically identical to  Lafayette County  of which his hometown of Oxford  Mississippi  is the county seat  Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner s  postage stamp   and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature  Three novels  The Hamlet  The Town and The Mansion  known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy  document the town of Jefferson and its environs  as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace   Faulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to diction and cadence  In contrast to the minimalist understatement of his contemporary Ernest Hemingway  Faulkner made frequent use of  stream of consciousness  in his writing  and wrote often highly emotional  subtle  cerebral  complex  and sometimes Gothic or grotesque stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves  poor white  agrarian  or working class Southerners  and Southern aristocrats   In an interview with The Paris Review in 1956  Faulkner remarked   Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique  There is no mechanical way to get the writing done  no shortcut  The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory  Teach yourself by your own mistakes  people learn only by error  The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice  He has supreme vanity  No matter how much he admires the old writer  he wants to beat him  Another esteemed Southern writer  Flannery O Connor  stated that  the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do  Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down   Faulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings  The Marble Faun  1924  and A Green Bough  1933   and a collection of crime fiction short stories  Knight s Gambit  1949    3  Criticism  Faulkner s work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives  The New Critics became very interested in Faulkner s work  with Cleanth Brooks writing The Yoknapatawpha Country and Michael Millgate writing The Achievement of William Faulkner  Since then  critics have looked at Faulkner s work using other approaches  such as psychoanalytic methods  Faulkner s works have been placed within the literary traditions of modernism and the Southern Renaissance   4  Awards  Faulkner was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature for  his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel   It was awarded at the following year s banquet along with the 1950 Prize to Bertrand Russell  Faulkner detested the fame and glory that resulted from his recognition  His aversion was so great that his 17 year old daughter learned of the Nobel Prize only when she was called to the principal s office during the school day   He donated part of his Nobel money  to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers   eventually resulting in the PEN Faulkner Award for Fiction  and donated another part to a local Oxford bank  establishing a scholarship fund to help educate African American teachers at Rust College in nearby Holly Springs  Mississippi  The government of France made Faulkner a Chevalier de la Legion d honneur in 1951   Faulkner was awarded two Pulitzer Prizes for what are considered  minor  novels  his 1954 novel A Fable  which took the Pulitzer in 1955  and the 1962 novel  The Reivers  which was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer in 1963  He also won the U S  National Book Award twice  for Collected Stories in 1951 and A Fable in 1955  In 1946 he was one of three finalists for the first Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine Award and placed second to Rhea Galati   The United States Postal Service issued a 22 cent postage stamp in his honor on August 3  1987  It is noteworthy that Faulkner had once served as Postmaster at the University of Mississippi  and in his letter of resignation in 1923 wrote   As long as I live under the capitalistic system  I expect to have my life influenced by the demands of moneyed people  But I will be damned if I propose to be at the beck and call of every itinerant scoundrel who has two cents to invest in a postage stamp   5  Bibliography  6  Collections
