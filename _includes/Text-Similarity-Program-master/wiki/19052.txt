Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42  The name is from Neo Latin Molybdaenum  from Ancient Greek   meaning lead  since its ores were confused with lead ores  Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history  but the element was discovered  in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals  in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele  The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm   Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth  but rather in various oxidation states in minerals  The free element  which is a silvery metal with a gray cast  has the sixth highest melting point of any element  It readily forms hard  stable carbides in alloys  and for this reason most of world production of the element  about 80%  is in making many types of steel alloys  including high strength alloys and superalloys   Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water  but the molybdate ion is soluble and forms when molybdenum containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water  Industrially  molybdenum compounds  about 14% of world production of the element  are used in high pressure and high temperature applications  as pigments  and as catalysts   are by far the most common catalysts used by some bacteria to break the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen  allowing biological nitrogen fixation  At least 50 molybdenum containing enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals  although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation  These nitrogenases contain molybdenum in a different form from the other molybdenum containing enzymes  which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum incorporated into a molybdenum cofactor  Owing to the diverse functions of the various molybdenum cofactor enzymes  molybdenum is a required element for life in all higher eukaryote organisms  though it is not required by all bacteria   1  Characteristics  1 1  Physical properties  In its pure form  molybdenum is a silvery grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5 5  It has a melting point of   of the naturally occurring elements  only tantalum  osmium  rhenium  tungsten  and carbon have higher melting points  Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at   It has one of the lowest coefficients of thermal expansion among commercially used metals  The tensile strength of molybdenum wires increases about 3 times  from about 10 to 30 GPa  when their diameter decreases from ~50–100 nm to 10 nm   1 2  Isotopes  There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum  ranging in atomic mass from 83 to 117  as well as four metastable nuclear isomers  Seven isotopes occur naturally  with atomic masses of 92  94  95  96  97  98  and 100  Of these naturally occurring isotopes  only molybdenum 100 is unstable   Molybdenum 98 is the most abundant isotope  comprising 24 14% of all molybdenum  Molybdenum 100 has a half life of about 1019 y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium 100  Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half lives of approximately 150 ns  All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium  technetium  and ruthenium   As also noted below  the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves molybdenum 99  which is a fission product  It is a parent radioisotope to the short lived gamma emitting daughter radioisotope technetium 99m  a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine  In 2008  the Delft University of Technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum 98 based production of molybdenum 99   1 3  Compounds and chemistry  Molybdenum is a transition metal with an electronegativity of 2 16 on the Pauling scale and a standard atomic weight of 95 95 g mol  It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature  and the bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600 °C  resulting in molybdenum trioxide   The trioxide is volatile and sublimates at high temperatures  This prevents formation of a continuous protective oxide layer  which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal  Molybdenum has several oxidation states  the most stable being +4 and +6  bolded in the table   The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to those of tungsten than that of chromium  An example is the instability of molybdenum III  and tungsten III  compounds as compared with the stability of the chromium III  compounds  The highest oxidation state is common in the molybdenum VI  oxide  MoO3   whereas the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2   Molybdenum VI  oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water  forming molybdates  MoO42−   Molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates  but they show a similar tendency to form complex oxyanions by condensation at lower pH values  such as  Mo7O24 6− and  Mo8O26 4−  Polymolybdates can incorporate other ions into their structure  forming polyoxometalates  The dark blue phosphorus containing heteropolymolybdate P Mo12O40 3− is used for the spectroscopic detection of phosphorus  The broad range of oxidation states of molybdenum is reflected in various molybdenum chlorides   Molybdenum II  chloride MoCl2  yellow solid   Molybdenum III  chloride MoCl3  dark red solid   Molybdenum IV  chloride MoCl4  black solid   Molybdenum V  chloride MoCl5  dark green solid   Molybdenum VI  chloride MoCl6  brown solid  The structure of the MoCl2 is composed of Mo6Cl84+ clusters with four chloride ions to compensate the charge   Like chromium and some other transition metals  molybdenum is able to form quadruple bonds  such as in Mo2 CH3COO 4  This compound can be transformed into Mo2Cl84−  which also has a quadruple bond   The oxidation state 0 is possible with carbon monoxide as ligand  such as in molybdenum hexacarbonyl  Mo CO 6   2  History  Molybdenite—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena  Molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were graphite  Like graphite  molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant  Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite  it was still confused with the common lead ore PbS  now called galena   the name comes from Ancient Greek   meaning lead   The Greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from Anatolian Luvian and Lydian languages    Although apparent deliberate alloying of molybdenum with steel in one 14th century Japanese sword  mfd  ca  1330  has been reported  that art was never employed widely and was later lost  In the West in 1754  Bengt Andersson Qvist examined molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead  and thus was not the same as galena   By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was  indeed  not galena nor graphite  Instead  Scheele went further and correctly proposed that molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element  named molybdenum for the mineral in which it resided  and from which it might be isolated  Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum by using carbon and linseed oil in 1781   For about a century after its isolation  molybdenum had no industrial use  owing to its relative scarcity  difficulty extracting the pure metal  and the immaturity of appropriate metallurgical techniques  Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise in their increased hardness  but efforts to manufacture them on a large scale were hampered by inconsistent results and a tendency toward brittleness and recrystallization  In 1906  William D  Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile  leading to its use as a heating element for high temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten filament light bulbs  oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas  In 1913  Frank E  Elmore developed a flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores  flotation remains the primary isolation process  During the first World War  demand for molybdenum spiked  it was used both in armor plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high speed steels  Some British tanks were protected by 75 mm  3 in  manganese steel plating  but this proved to be ineffective  The manganese steel plates were replaced with 25 mm  1 in  molybdenum steel plating allowing for higher speed  greater maneuverability  and better protection  The Germans also used molybdenum doped steel for heavy artillery  This was because traditional steel melted at the heat produced by enough gunpowder to launch a one ton shell  After the war  demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications  In World War II  molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys   3  Occurrence and production  Molybdenum is the 54th most abundant element in the Earth s crust and the 25th most abundant element in its oceans  with an average of 10 parts per billion  it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe  The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum bearing grain  1 × 0 6 µm  in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon  The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth s crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water insoluble ores  often combined with sulfur  in the same way as copper  with which it is often found  Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite  PbMoO4  and powellite  CaMoO4   the main commercial source of molybdenum is molybdenite  MoS2   Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore  and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining   Historically  the Knaben mine in southern Norway  opened in 1885  was the first dedicated molybdenum mine  It closed from 1973 to 2007  but is now reopened  Large mines in Colorado  such as the Henderson mine and the Climax mine  and in British Columbia yield molybdenite as their primary product  while many porphyry copper deposits such as the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah and the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile produce molybdenum as a byproduct of copper mining   The world s production of molybdenum was 250 000 tonnes in 2011  the largest producers being China  94 000 t   United States  64 000 t   Chile  38 000 t   Peru  18 000 t  and Mexico  12 000 t   The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes  and are mostly concentrated in China  4 3 Mt   US  2 7 Mt  and Chile  1 2 Mt   By continent  93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly split between North America  South America  mainly in Chile   and China  Europe and the rest of Asia  mostly Armenia  Russia  Iran and Mongolia  produce the remainder   In molybdenite processing  the molybdenite is first heated to a temperature of and the sulfide is oxidized into molybdenum VI  oxide by air   The oxidized ore is then either heated to to sublimate the oxide  or leached with ammonia  which reacts with the molybdenum VI  oxide to form water soluble molybdates   Copper  an impurity in molybdenite  is less soluble in ammonia  To completely remove it from the solution  it is precipitated with hydrogen sulfide   Pure molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen  while the molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the aluminothermic reaction with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum  A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum   Molybdenum has a value of approximately $30 000 per tonne as of August 2009  It maintained a price at or near $10 000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003  and reached  due to increased demand  a peak of $103 000 per tonne in June 2005  In 2008 the London Metal Exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity on the exchange   4  Applications  4 1  Alloys  About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgical applications such as alloys  with the rest of molybdenum used as compounds in chemical applications  Estimated fractional global industrial use of molybdenum is structural steel 35%  stainless steel 25%  chemicals 14%  tool & high speed steels 9%  cast iron 6%  molybdenum elemental metal 6%  and superalloys  5%   The ability of molybdenum to withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening makes it useful in applications that involve intense heat  including the manufacture of armor  aircraft parts  electrical contacts  industrial motors and filaments   Most high strength steel alloys  example 41xx steels  contain 0 25% to 8% molybdenum  Despite such small portions  more than 43 000 tonnes of molybdenum are used as an alloying agent each year in stainless steels  tool steels  cast irons and high temperature superalloys   Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability  Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to type 300 stainless steels  specifically type 316  and especially so in the so called superaustenitic stainless steels  such as alloy AL 6XN  254SMO or 1925hMo   Molybdenum acts by increasing lattice strain  thus increasing the energy required to dissolve out iron atoms from the surface  Molybdenum can also be used to enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic  for example grade 444  and martensitic  for example 1 4122 and 1 4418  stainless steels   Because of its lower density and more stable price  molybdenum is sometimes used instead of tungsten  An example is the  M  series of high speed steels such as M2  M4 and M42 as substitution for the  T  steel series  which contain tungsten  Molybdenum can be implemented both as an alloying agent and as a flame resistant coating for other metals  Although its melting point is   molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above making it better suited for use in vacuum environments   TZM  Mo  ~99%   Ti  ~0 5%   Zr  ~0 08%  and some C  is a corrosion resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above 1300C  It has about twice the strength of pure Mo  and is more ductile and more weldable  yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt  FLiBe  and salt vapors used in molten salt reactors for 1100 hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure   Other molybdenum based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications  For example  because of the corrosion resistance against molten zinc  both pure molybdenum and the molybdenum tungsten alloy  70% 30%  are used for piping  stirrers and pump impellers which come into contact with molten zinc   4 2  Other applications as the pure element  Molybdenum powder is used as a fertilizer for some plants  such as cauliflower   Elemental molybdenum is also used in NO  NO2  NOx analyzers in power plants for pollution controls  At the element acts as a catalyst for NO2 NOx to form only NO molecules for consistent readings by infrared light   Molybdenum anodes replace tungsten in certain low voltage X ray sources  for specialized uses such as mammography   The radioactive isotope molybdenum 99 is used to generate technetium 99m  which is used for medical imaging   4 2 1  Compounds  14% of global use   Molybdenum disulfide  MoS2  is used as a solid lubricant and a high pressure high temperature  HPHT  antiwear agent  It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — in the event of a catastrophic grease failure  a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts  It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications  MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen  sulfur and oxygen   Molybdenum disilicide  MoSi2  is an electrically conducting ceramic with primary use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500 °C in air   Molybdenum trioxide  MoO3  is used as an adhesive between enamels and metals  Lead molybdate  wulfenite  co precipitated with lead chromate and lead sulfate is a bright orange pigment used with ceramics and plastics   Ammonium heptamolybdate is used in biological staining procedures   Molybdenum coated soda lime glass is used for CIGS solar cell fabrication   Phosphomolybdic acid is a stain used in thin layer chromatography   Molybdenum 99 is a parent radioisotope to the daughter radioisotope technetium 99m  which is used in many medical procedures  The isotope is handled and stored as the molybdate   5  Biological role  5 1  Biochemistry  Nitrogenases  The most important role of the molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes  In nitrogen fixation in certain bacteria  the nitrogenase enzyme  which is involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen  usually contains molybdenum in the active site  though replacement of Mo with iron or vanadium is also known   The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme is similar to that in iron sulfur proteins  it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters   The reaction that nitrogenase enzymes perform is   With protons and electrons from the electron transport chain  nitrogen is reduced to ammonia and free hydrogen gas  This is an energy using process  requiring the splitting  hydrolysis  of ATP into ADP plus free phosphate  Pi    In 2008  evidence was reported that a scarcity of molybdenum in the Earth s early oceans was a limiting factor for nearly two billion years in the further evolution of eukaryotic life  which includes all plants and animals  as eukaryotes cannot fix nitrogen  and must therefore acquire most of their oxidized nitrogen suitable for making organic nitrogen compounds  or the organics themselves  like proteins  from prokaryotic bacteria  The scarcity of molybdenum resulted from the relative lack of oxygen in the early ocean  Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water  but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water  Once oxygen made by early life appeared in seawater  it helped dissolve molybdenum into soluble molybdate from minerals on the sea bottom  making it available for the first time to nitrogen fixing bacteria  and allowing them to provide more fixed usable nitrogen compounds for higher forms of life  In 2013  it was suggested possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago   Although oxygen once promoted nitrogen fixation via making molybdenum available in water  it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes  Thus  in Earth s ancient history  after oxygen arrived in large quantities in Earth s air and water  organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions were required to isolate and protect their nitrogen fixing enzymes in heterocysts  or similar structures protecting them from too much oxygen  This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions from oxygen in aerobic organisms continues to the present   Molybdenum cofactor enzymes  Though molybdenum forms compounds with various organic molecules  including carbohydrates and amino acids  it is transported throughout the human body as MoO42−  At least 50 molybdenum containing enzymes were known by 2002  mostly in bacteria  and their number is increasing with every year  those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase  sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase  In some animals  and in humans  the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid  a process of purine catabolism  is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase  a molybdenum containing enzyme  The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body  However  an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes  Molybdenum concentrations also affect protein synthesis  metabolism and growth   In animals and plants a tricyclic compound called molybdopterin  which  despite the name  contains no molybdenum  is reacted with molybdate to form a complete molybdenum containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor  Save for the phylogenetically ancient molybdenum nitrogenases discussed above  which fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria  all molybdenum using enzymes so far identified in nature use the molybdenum cofactor  where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI  similar to molybdate  Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules  as part of the regulation of nitrogen  sulfur and carbon cycles   5 2  Human dietary intake and deficiency  Molybdenum is an essential trace element and crucial for the survival of animals  Four mammalian Mo dependent enzymes are known  all of them harboring a pterin based molybdenum cofactor  Moco  in their active site  sulfite oxidase  xanthine oxidoreductase  aldehyde oxidase  and mitochondrial amidoxime reductase  People severely deficient in molybdenum have poorly functioning sulfite oxidase and are prone to toxic reactions to sulfites in foods  The human body contains about 0 07 mg of molybdenum per kilogram of weight  It occurs in higher concentrations in the liver and kidneys and in lower concentrations in the vertebrae  Molybdenum is also present within human tooth enamel and may help prevent its decay   The average daily intake of molybdenum varies between 0 12 and 0 24 mg  depending on the molybdenum content of the food  Pork  lamb  and beef liver each have approximately 1 5 parts per million of molybdenum  Other significant dietary sources include green beans  eggs  sunflower seeds  wheat flour  lentils  cucumbers and cereal grain  Acute toxicity has not been seen in humans  and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state  Studies on rats show a median lethal dose  LD50  as low as 180 mg kg for some Mo compounds  Although human toxicity data is unavailable  animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10 mg day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea  growth retardation  infertility  low birth weight and gout  it can also affect the lungs  kidneys and liver  Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum  Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues   Dietary molybdenum deficiency from low soil concentration of molybdenum has been associated with increased rates of esophageal cancer in a geographical band from northern China to Iran  Compared to the United States  which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil  people living in these areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma   Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition  complete intravenous feeding  for long periods of time  It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate  in much the same way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency  However  presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this mechanism is seen primarily in adults  the neurological consequences have not been as marked as for the congenital cofactor deficiency   5 3  Related diseases  A congenital molybdenum cofactor deficiency disease  seen in infants  results in interference with the ability of the body to use molybdenum in enzymes  It causes high levels of sulfite and urate  and neurological damage  The cause is the inability of the body to synthesize molybdenum cofactor  a heterocyclic molecule that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human enzymes that use molybdenum   5 4  Copper molybdenum antagonism  High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body s uptake of copper  producing copper deficiency  Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper  and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine  Ruminants that consume high amounts of molybdenum develop symptoms including diarrhea  stunted growth  anemia and achromotrichia  loss of hair pigment   These symptoms can be alleviated by the administration of more copper into the system  both in dietary form and by injection  The condition  as an effective copper deficiency  can be aggravated by excess sulfur   Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate  in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper chelating agent  Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically in the treatment of copper toxicosis in animals  It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson s disease  a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans  it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion  It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis  potentially via the inhibition of copper ion dependent membrane translocation process involving a non classical secretion pathway  This makes it an interesting investigatory treatment for cancer  age related macular degeneration  and other diseases featuring excessive blood vessel deposition   6  Precautions  Molybdenum dusts and fumes  which can be generated by mining or metalworking  can be toxic  especially if ingested  including dust trapped in the sinuses and later swallowed   Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin  Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided  OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8 hour day as 5 mg m3  Chronic exposure to 60 to 600 mg m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue  headaches and joint pains   7
