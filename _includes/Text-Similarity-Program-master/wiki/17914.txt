Ludwig van Beethoven      baptised 17 December 177026 March 1827  was a German composer and pianist  A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music  he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers  His best known compositions include 9 symphonies  5 concertos for piano  32 piano sonatas  and 16 string quartets  He also composed other chamber music  choral works  including the celebrated Missa solemnis   and songs   Born in Bonn  then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire  Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and by Christian Gottlob Neefe  During his first 22 years in Bonn  Beethoven intended to study with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and befriended Joseph Haydn  Beethoven moved to Vienna in 1792 and began studying with Haydn  quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist  He lived in Vienna until his death  In about 1800 his hearing began to deteriorate  and by the last decade of his life he was almost totally deaf  He gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose  many of his most admired works come from this period   1  Biography  1 1  Background and early life  Beethoven was the grandson of Lodewijk van Beethoven  1712–73   a musician from Mechelen in the Southern Netherlands  now part of Belgium  who at the age of twenty moved to Bonn  Lodewijk  Ludwig is the German cognate of Dutch Lodewijk  was employed as a bass singer at the court of the Elector of Cologne  eventually rising to become Kapellmeister  music director   Lodewijk had one son  Johann  1740–1792   who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave lessons on piano and violin to supplement his income  Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767  she was the daughter of Johann Heinrich Keverich  who had been the head chef at the court of the Archbishopric of Trier   Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn  There is no authentic record of the date of his birth  however  the registry of his baptism  in a Roman Catholic service at the Parish of St  Regius on 17 December 1770  survives  As children of that era were traditionally baptised the day after birth in the Catholic Rhine country  and it is known that Beethoven s family and his teacher Johann Albrechtsberger celebrated his birthday on 16 December  most scholars accept 16 December 1770 as Beethoven s date of birth  Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven  only Ludwig  the second born  and two younger brothers survived infancy  Caspar Anton Carl was born on 8 April 1774  and Nikolaus Johann  the youngest  was born on 2 October 1776   Beethoven s first music teacher was his father  Although tradition has it that Johann van Beethoven was a harsh instructor  and that the child Beethoven   made to stand at the keyboard  was often in tears   the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians claimed that no solid documentation supported this  and asserted that  speculation and myth making have both been productive   Beethoven had other local teachers  the court organist Gilles van den Eeden  d  1782   Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer  a family friend  who taught Beethoven the piano   and Franz Rovantini  a relative  who instructed him in playing the violin and viola   Beethoven s musical talent was obvious at a young age  Johann  aware of Leopold Mozart s successes in this area  with son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl   attempted to exploit his son as a child prodigy  claiming that Beethoven was six  he was seven  on the posters for Beethoven s first public performance in March 1778   Some time after 1779  Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn  Christian Gottlob Neefe  who was appointed the Court s Organist in that year  Neefe taught Beethoven composition  and by March 1783 had helped him write his first published composition  a set of keyboard variations  WoO 63   Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist  at first unpaid  1781   and then as a paid employee  1784  of the court chapel conducted by the Kapellmeister Andrea Luchesi  His first three piano sonatas  named  Kurfürst    Elector   for their dedication to the Elector Maximilian Friedrich  1708–1784   were published in 1783  Maximilian Frederick noticed Beethoven s talent early  and subsidised and encouraged the young man s musical studies   Maximilian Frederick s successor as the Elector of Bonn was Maximilian Franz  the youngest son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria  and he brought notable changes to Bonn  Echoing changes made in Vienna by his brother Joseph  he introduced reforms based on Enlightenment philosophy  with increased support for education and the arts  The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes  He may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry  as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the Order of the Illuminati   In March 1787 Beethoven traveled to Vienna  possibly at another s expense  for the first time  apparently in the hope of studying with Mozart  The details of their relationship are uncertain  including whether or not they actually met  After just two months Beethoven learned that his mother was severely ill  and returned home  His mother died shortly thereafter  and his father lapsed deeper into alcoholism  As a result  Beethoven became responsible for the care of his two younger brothers  and he spent the next five years in Bonn   Beethoven was introduced to several people who became important in his life in these years  Franz Wegeler  a young medical student  introduced him to the von Breuning family  one of whose daughters Wegeler eventually married   Beethoven often visited the von Breuning household  where he taught piano to some of the children  Here he encountered German and classical literature  The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own  which was increasingly dominated by his father s decline  Beethoven also came to the attention of Count Ferdinand von Waldstein  who became a lifelong friend and financial supporter   In 1789 Beethoven obtained a legal order by which half of his father s salary was paid directly to him for support of the family  He also contributed further to the family s income by playing viola in the court orchestra  This familiarised Beethoven with a variety of operas  including three by Mozart that were performed at court in this period  He also befriended Anton Reicha  a flautist and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra s conductor  Josef Reicha   1 2  Establishing his career in Vienna  From 1790 to 1792  Beethoven composed a significant number of works  none were published at the time  and most are now listed as works without opus  that demonstrated his growing range and maturity  Musicologists identified a theme similar to those of his third symphony in a set of variations written in 1791  Beethoven was probably first introduced to Joseph Haydn in late 1790  when the latter was traveling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time  A year and a half later they met in Bonn on Haydn s return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792  and it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the old master  With the Elector s help  Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792  amid rumors of war spilling out of France  he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died  Mozart had also recently died  Count Waldstein  in his farewell note to Beethoven  wrote   Through uninterrupted diligence you will receive Mozart s spirit through Haydn s hands   Over the next few years  Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master s work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavor   Beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer  but rather devoted himself to study and performance  Working under Haydn s direction  he sought to master counterpoint  He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh  Early in this period  he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri  primarily in Italian vocal composition style  this relationship persisted until at least 1802  and possibly 1809  With Haydn s departure for England in 1794  Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home  He chose instead to remain in Vienna  continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers  Although his stipend from the Elector expired  a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support  among them Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz  Prince Karl Lichnowsky  and Baron Gottfried van Swieten   By 1793  Beethoven established a reputation as an improviser in the salons of the nobility  often playing the preludes and fugues of J  S  Bach s Well Tempered Clavier  His friend Nikolaus Simrock had begun publishing his compositions  the first are believed to be a set of variations  WoO 66   By 1793  he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso  but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their publication in 1795 would have greater impact  Beethoven s first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795  a concert in which he first performed one of his piano concertos  It is uncertain whether this was the First or Second  Documentary evidence is unclear  and both concertos were in a similar state of near completion  neither was completed or published for several years   Shortly after this performance  he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number  the three piano trios  Opus 1  These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky  and were a financial success  Beethoven s profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year   1 3  Musical maturity  Beethoven composed his first six string quartets  Op  18  between 1798 and 1800  commissioned by  and dedicated to  Prince Lobkowitz   They were published in 1801  With premieres of his First and Second Symphonies in 1800 and 1803  Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart  He also continued to write in other forms  turning out widely known piano sonatas like the  Pathétique  sonata  Op  13   which Cooper describes as  surpass ing  any of his previous compositions  in strength of character  depth of emotion  level of originality  and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation   He also completed his Septet  Op  20  in 1799  which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime   For the premiere of his First Symphony  Beethoven hired the Burgtheater on 2 April 1800  and staged an extensive program of music  including works by Haydn and Mozart  as well as his Septet  the First Symphony  and one of his piano concertos  the latter three works all then unpublished   The concert  which the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung described as  the most interesting concert in a long time   was not without difficulties  among the criticisms was that  the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist    Mozart and Haydn were undeniable influences  For example  Beethoven s quintet for piano and winds is said to bear a strong resemblance to Mozart s work for the same configuration  albeit with his own distinctive touches   But Beethoven s melodies  musical development  use of modulation and texture  and characterization of emotion all set him apart from his influences  and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published  By the end of 1800 Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers   In May 1799  Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik  During this time  Beethoven fell in love with the younger daughter Josephine who has therefore been identified as one of the more likely candidates for the addressee of his letter to the  Immortal Beloved   in 1812   Shortly after these lessons  Josephine was married to Count Josef Deym  Beethoven was a regular visitor at their house  continuing to teach Josephine  and playing at parties and concerts  Her marriage was by all accounts happy  despite initial financial problems   and the couple had four children  Her relationship with Beethoven intensified after Deym died suddenly in 1804   Beethoven had few other students  From 1801 to 1805  he tutored Ferdinand Ries  who went on to become a composer and later wrote Beethoven remembered  a book about their encounters  The young Carl Czerny studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803  Czerny went on to become a renowned music teacher himself  instructing Franz Liszt  and gave on 11 February 1812 the Vienna premiere of Beethoven s fifth piano concerto  the  Emperor     Beethoven s compositions between 1800 and 1802 were dominated by two large scale orchestral works  although he continued to produce other important works such as the piano sonata Sonata quasi una fantasia known as the  Moonlight Sonata   In the spring of 1801 he completed The Creatures of Prometheus  a ballet  The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802  and Beethoven rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity  In the spring of 1802 he completed the Second Symphony  intended for performance at a concert that was canceled  The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the Theater an der Wien  where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence  In addition to the Second Symphony  the concert also featured the First Symphony  the Third Piano Concerto  and the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives  Reviews were mixed  but the concert was a financial success  Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket   Beethoven s business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Carl  who had previously assisted him casually  began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs  In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works  Carl also began selling some of Beethoven s earlier unpublished works  and encouraged Beethoven  against the latter s preference  to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations  Beethoven acceded to these requests  as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works   1 4  Loss of hearing  Around 1796  by the age of 26  Beethoven began to lose his hearing  He suffered from a severe form of tinnitus  a  ringing  in his ears that made it hard for him to hear music  he also tried to avoid conversations  The cause of Beethoven s deafness is unknown  but it has variously been attributed to typhus  auto immune disorders  such as systemic lupus erythematosus   and even his habit of immersing his head in cold water to stay awake  The explanation from Beethoven s autopsy was that he had a  distended inner ear   which developed lesions over time   As early as 1801  Beethoven wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings  although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems   Beethoven  on the advice of his doctor  lived in the small Austrian town of Heiligenstadt  just outside Vienna  from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition  There he wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament  a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art  Over time  his hearing loss became profound  at the end of the premiere of his Ninth Symphony in 1824  he had to be turned around to see the tumultuous applause of the audience because he could hear neither it nor the orchestra  Beethoven s hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music  but it made playing at concerts—a lucrative source of income—increasingly difficult  After a failed attempt in 1811 to perform his own Piano Concerto No  5  the  Emperor    which was premiered by his student Carl Czerny  he never performed in public again until he conducted the Ninth Symphony in 1824   A large collection of Beethoven s hearing aids  such as a special ear horn  can be viewed at the Beethoven House Museum in Bonn  Germany  Despite his obvious distress  Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812  By 1814 however  Beethoven was almost totally deaf  and when a group of visitors saw him play a loud arpeggio of thundering bass notes at his piano remarking   Ist es nicht schön    Is it not beautiful    they felt deep sympathy considering his courage and sense of humor  he lost the ability to hear higher frequencies first    As a result of Beethoven s hearing loss  his conversation books are an unusually rich written resource  Used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life  his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying  and he then responded either orally or in the book  The books contain discussions about music and other matters  and give insights into Beethoven s thinking  they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed  and also his perception of his relationship to art  Out of a total of 400 conversation books  it has been suggested that 264 were destroyed  and others were altered  after Beethoven s death by Anton Schindler  who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive  However  Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler s destruction of a large number of conversation books   1 5  Patronage  While Beethoven earned income from publication of his works and from public performances  he also depended on the generosity of patrons for income  for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication  Some of his early patrons  including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky  gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works   Perhaps Beethoven s most important aristocratic patron was Archduke Rudolph  the youngest son of Emperor Leopold II  who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with Beethoven  The cleric  Cardinal Priest  and the composer became friends  and their meetings continued until 1824  Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolph  including the Archduke Trio  1811  and his great Missa Solemnis  1823   Rudolph  in turn  dedicated one of his own compositions to Beethoven  The letters Beethoven wrote to Rudolph are today kept at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna  Another patron was Count  later Prince  Andreas Razumovsky  for whom the String Quartets Nos  7–9  Op  59  Rasumovsky were named   In the Autumn of 1808  after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre  Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon s brother Jérôme Bonaparte  then king of Westphalia  for a well paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel  To persuade him to stay in Vienna  the Archduke Rudolph  Prince Kinsky and Prince Lobkowitz  after receiving representations from the composer s friends  pledged to pay Beethoven a pension of 4000 florins a year  Only Archduke Rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date  Kinsky  immediately called to military duty  did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse  Lobkowitz stopped paying in September 1811  No successors came forward to continue the patronage  and Beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815  The effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by war with France  which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war efforts   1 6  The middle period  Beethoven s return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style  and is now designated as the start of his middle or  heroic  period  According to Carl Czerny  Beethoven said   I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far  From now on I intend to take a new way   This  heroic  phase was characterised by a large number of original works composed on a grand scale  The first major work employing this new style was the Third Symphony in E flat  known as the Eroica  This work was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony  When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception  Some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure  while others viewed it as a masterpiece   The  middle period  is sometimes associated with a  heroic  manner of composing  but the use of the term  heroic  has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship  The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period  The appropriateness of the term  heroic  to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well  while some works  like the Third and Fifth Symphonies  are easy to describe as  heroic   many others  like his Symphony No  6  Pastoral  are not   Some of the middle period works extend the musical language Beethoven had inherited from Haydn and Mozart  The middle period work includes the Third through Eighth Symphonies  the Rasumovsky  Harp and Serioso string quartets  the  Waldstein  and  Appassionata  piano sonatas  Christ on the Mount of Olives  the opera Fidelio  the Violin Concerto and many other compositions  During this time Beethoven s income came from publishing his works  from performances of them  and from his patrons  His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theater changed management in early 1804  and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning  This slowed work on Fidelio  his largest work to date  for a time  It was delayed again by the Austrian censor  and finally premiered in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the French occupation of the city  In addition to being a financial failure  this version of Fidelio was also a critical failure  and Beethoven began revising it   During May 1809  when the attacking forces of Napoleon bombarded Vienna  according to Ferdinand Ries  Beethoven  very worried that the noise would destroy what remained of his hearing  hid in the basement of his brother s house  covering his ears with pillows   The work of the middle period established Beethoven as a master  In a review from 1810  he was enshrined by E  T  A  Hoffmann as one of the three great  Romantic  composers  Hoffman called Beethoven s Fifth Symphony  one of the most important works of the age    1 7  Personal and family difficulties  Beethoven s love life was hampered by class issues  In late 1801 he met a young countess  Julie   Giulietta   Guicciardi through the Brunsvik family  at a time when he was giving regular piano lessons to Josephine Brunsvik  Beethoven mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to his boyhood friend  Franz Wegeler  but he could not consider marrying her  due to the class difference  Beethoven later dedicated to her his Sonata No  14  now commonly known as the  Moonlight  Sonata   His relationship with Josephine Brunsvik deepened after the death in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband  the Count Joseph Deym  Beethoven wrote Josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809 10  Although his feelings were obviously reciprocated  Josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807  She cited her  duty  and the fact that she would have lost the custodianship of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner  After Josephine married Baron von Stackelberg in 1810  Beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to Therese Malfatti  the supposed dedicatee of  Für Elise   his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans   In the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill  suffering headaches and high fever  On the advice of his doctor  he spent six weeks in the Bohemian spa town of Teplitz  The following winter  which was dominated by work on the Seventh symphony  he was again ill  and his doctor ordered him to spend the summer of 1812 at the spa Teplitz  It is certain that he was at Teplitz when he wrote a love letter to his  Immortal Beloved   The identity of the intended recipient has long been a subject of debate  candidates include Julie Guicciardi  Therese Malfatti  Josephine Brunsvik  and Antonie Brentano   Beethoven visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812  He wished to end Johann s cohabitation with Therese Obermayer  a woman who already had an illegitimate child  He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities  Johann and Therese married on 9 November   In early 1813 Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period  and his compositional output dropped  His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public  especially when dining  Beethoven took care of his brother  who was suffering from tuberculosis  and his family  an expense that he claimed left him penniless   Beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813  when news arrived of the defeat of one of Napoleon s armies at Vitoria  Spain  by a coalition of forces under the Duke of Wellington  This news stimulated him to write the battle symphony known as Wellington s Victory  It was first performed on 8 December  along with his Seventh Symphony  at a charity concert for victims of the war  The work was a popular hit  probably because of its programmatic style  which was entertaining and easy to understand  It received repeat performances at concerts Beethoven staged in January and February 1814  Beethoven s renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of Fidelio  which  in its third revised version  was also well received at its July opening  That summer he composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years  No  27  Opus 90   This work was in a markedly more Romantic style than his earlier sonatas  He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the Congress of Vienna that began in November 1814  His output of songs included his only song cycle   An die ferne Geliebte   and the extraordinarily expressive second setting of the poem  An die Hoffnung   Op  94  in 1815  Compared to its first setting in 1805  a gift for Josephine Brunsvik   it was  far more dramatic     The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena    1 8  Custody struggle and illness  Between 1815 and 1817 Beethoven s output dropped again  Beethoven attributed part of this to a lengthy illness  he called it an  inflammatory fever   that afflicted him for more than a year  starting in October 1816  Biographers have speculated on a variety of other reasons that also contributed to the decline  including the difficulties in the personal lives of his would be paramours and the harsh censorship policies of the Austrian government  The illness and death of his brother Carl from tuberculosis may also have played a role   Carl had been ill for some time  and Beethoven spent a small fortune in 1815 on his care  After Carl died on 15 November 1815  Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Carl s wife Johanna over custody of their son Karl  then nine years old  Beethoven  who considered Johanna an unfit parent because of her morals  she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying Carl and had been convicted of theft  and financial management  had successfully applied to Carl to have himself named sole guardian of the boy  A late codicil to Carl s will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship  While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in February 1816  the case was not fully resolved until 1820  and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to Karl s welfare  whom he first placed in a private school   The Austrian court system had one court for the nobility and members of the Landtafel  the Landrechte  and many other courts for commoners  among them the Civil Court of the Vienna Magistrate  Beethoven disguised the fact that the Dutch  van  in his name did not denote nobility as does the German  von  and his case was tried in the Landrechte  Owing to his influence with the court  Beethoven felt assured of the favorable outcome of being awarded sole guardianship  While giving evidence to the Landrechte  however  Beethoven inadvertently admitted that he was not nobly born  On 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the Magistracy  where he lost sole guardianship   Beethoven appealed and regained custody  Johanna s appeal to the Emperor was not successful  the Emperor  washed his hands of the matter   During the years of custody that followed  Beethoven attempted to ensure that Karl lived to the highest moral standards  Beethoven had an overbearing manner and frequently interfered in his nephew s life  Karl attempted suicide on 31 July 1826 by shooting himself in the head  He survived and was brought to his mother s house  where he recuperated  He and Beethoven were reconciled  but Karl insisted on joining the army and last saw Beethoven in early 1827   1 9  Late works  Beethoven began a renewed study of older music  including works by J  S  Bach and Handel  that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions  He composed the overture The Consecration of the House  which was the first work to attempt to incorporate these influences  A new style emerged  now called his  late period   He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade  the works of the late period are commonly held to include the last five piano sonatas and the Diabelli Variations  the last two sonatas for cello and piano  the late string quartets  see below   and two works for very large forces  the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth Symphony   By early 1818 Beethoven s health had improved  and his nephew moved in with him in January  On the downside  his hearing had deteriorated to the point that conversation became difficult  necessitating the use of conversation books  His household management had also improved somewhat  Nanette Streicher  who had assisted in his care during his illness  continued to provide some support  and he finally found a skilled cook  His musical output in 1818 was still somewhat reduced  but included song collections and the  Hammerklavier  Sonata  as well as sketches for two symphonies that eventually coalesced into the epic Ninth  In 1819 he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around Karl  and began work on the Diabelli Variations and the Missa Solemnis   For the next few years he continued to work on the Missa  composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income  and completing the Diabelli Variations  He was ill again for an extended time in 1821  and completed the Missa in 1823  three years after its original due date  He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work  an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971  Beethoven s brother Johann began to take a hand in his business affairs  much in the way Carl had earlier  locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the Missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it   Two commissions in 1822 improved Beethoven s financial prospects  The Philharmonic Society of London offered a commission for a symphony  and Prince Nikolas Golitsin of St  Petersburg offered to pay Beethoven s price for three string quartets  The first of these commissions spurred Beethoven to finish the Ninth Symphony  which was first performed  along with the Missa Solemnis  on 7 May 1824  to great acclaim at the Kärntnertortheater  The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung gushed   inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world   and Carl Czerny wrote that his symphony  breathes such a fresh  lively  indeed youthful spirit     so much power  innovation  and beauty as ever  came  from the head of this original man  although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads   Unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts  this did not make Beethoven much money  as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher  A second concert on 24 May  in which the producer guaranteed Beethoven a minimum fee  was poorly attended  nephew Karl noted that  many people  had  already gone into the country   It was Beethoven s last public concert   Beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin  This series of quartets  known as the  Late Quartets   went far beyond what musicians or audiences were ready for at that time  One musician commented that  we know there is something there  but we do not know what it is   Composer Louis Spohr called them  indecipherable  uncorrected horrors   Opinion has changed considerably from the time of their first bewildered reception  their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including Richard Wagner and Béla Bartók  and continue to do so  Of the late quartets  Beethoven s favorite was the Fourteenth Quartet  op  131 in C minor  which he rated as his most perfect single work  The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op  131 quartet  which he did on 14 November 1828  five days before his death   Beethoven wrote the last quartets amidst failing health  In April 1825 he was bedridden  and remained ill for about a month  The illness—or more precisely  his recovery from it—is remembered for having given rise to the deeply felt slow movement of the Fifteenth Quartet  which Beethoven called  Holy song of thanks   Heiliger Dankgesang   to the divinity  from one made well   He went on to complete the quartets now numbered Thirteenth  Fourteenth  and Sixteenth  The last work completed by Beethoven was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet  which replaced the difficult Große Fuge  Shortly thereafter  in December 1826  illness struck again  with episodes of vomiting and diarrhea that nearly ended his life   In 1825  his nine symphonies were performed in a cycle for the first time  by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Johann Philipp Christian Schulz  This was repeated in 1826   1 10  Illness and death  Beethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months  and many friends came to visit  He died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56 during a thunderstorm  His friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner  who was present at the time  said that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death  An autopsy revealed significant liver damage  which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption  It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves   Beethoven s funeral procession on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20 000 Viennese citizens  Franz Schubert  who died the following year and was buried next to Beethoven  was one of the torchbearers  Beethoven was buried in a dedicated grave in the Währing cemetery  north west of Vienna  after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity  Dreifaltigkeitskirche   His remains were exhumed for study in 1862  and moved in 1888 to Vienna s Zentralfriedhof  In 2012  his crypt was checked to see if his teeth had been stolen during a series of grave robberies of other famous Viennese composers   There is dispute about the cause of Beethoven s death  alcoholic cirrhosis  syphilis  infectious hepatitis  lead poisoning  sarcoidosis and Whipple s disease have all been proposed  Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair  some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis  as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation  Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that Beethoven was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor   2  Character  Beethoven s personal life was troubled by his encroaching deafness and irritability brought on by chronic abdominal pain  beginning in his twenties  which led him to contemplate suicide  documented in his Heiligenstadt Testament   Beethoven was often irascible  It has been suggested he suffered from bipolar disorder  Nevertheless  he had a close and devoted circle of friends all his life  thought to have been attracted by his strength of personality  Toward the end of his life  Beethoven s friends competed in their efforts to help him cope with his incapacities   Sources show Beethoven s disdain for authority  and for social rank  He stopped performing at the piano if the audience chatted amongst themselves  or afforded him less than their full attention  At soirées  he refused to perform if suddenly called upon to do so  Eventually  after many confrontations  the Archduke Rudolph decreed that the usual rules of court etiquette did not apply to Beethoven   Beethoven was attracted to the ideals of the Enlightenment  In 1804  when Napoleon s imperial ambitions became clear  Beethoven took hold of the title page of his Third Symphony and scratched the name Bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper  He later changed the work s title to  Sinfonia Eroica  composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d un grand uom    Heroic Symphony  composed to celebrate the memory of a great man    and he rededicated it to his patron  Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz  at whose palace it was first performed   The fourth movement of his Ninth Symphony features an elaborate choral setting of Schiller s Ode An die Freude   Ode to Joy    an optimistic hymn championing the brotherhood of humanity   3  Music  Beethoven is acknowledged as one of the giants of classical music  he is occasionally referred to as one of the  three Bs   along with Bach and Brahms  who epitomise that tradition  He was also a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical classicism to 19th century romanticism  and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound  His music features twice on the Voyager Golden Record  a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images  common sounds  languages  and music of Earth  sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes   3 1  Overview  Beethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations  His works for symphony orchestra include nine symphonies  the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus   and about a dozen pieces of  occasional  music  He wrote seven concerti for one or more soloists and orchestra  as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra  His only opera is Fidelio  other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two masses and a number of shorter works   His large body of compositions for piano includes 32 piano sonatas and numerous shorter pieces  including arrangements of some of his other works  Works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas  5 cello sonatas  and a sonata for French horn  as well as numerous lieder   Beethoven also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music  In addition to 16 string quartets  he wrote five works for string quintet  seven for piano trio  five for string trio  and more than a dozen works for various combinations of wind instruments   3 2  The three periods  Beethoven s compositional career is usually divided into early  middle  and late periods  In this scheme  his early period is taken to last until about 1802  the middle period from about 1803 to about 1814  and the late period from about 1815   In his early period  Beethoven s work was strongly influenced by his predecessors Haydn and Mozart  He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work  Some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies  the set of six string quartets Opus 18  the first two piano concertos  and the first dozen or so piano sonatas  including the famous Pathétique sonata  Op  13   His middle  heroic  period began shortly after Beethoven s personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness  It includes large scale works that express heroism and struggle  Middle period works include six symphonies  Nos  3–8   the last three piano concertos  the Triple Concerto and violin concerto  five string quartets  Nos  7–11   several piano sonatas  including the Moonlight  Waldstein and Appassionata sonatas   the Kreutzer violin sonata and Beethoven s only opera  Fidelio   Beethoven s late period began around 1815  Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth  their formal innovations  and their intense  highly personal expression  The String Quartet  Op  131 has seven linked movements  and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement  Other compositions from this period include the Missa Solemnis  the last five string quartets  including the massive Große Fuge  and the last five piano sonatas   4  In popular culture  4 1  Film  Un grand amour de Beethoven was directed in 1937 by
