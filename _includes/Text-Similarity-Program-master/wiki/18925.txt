Mormons    are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism  the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity  which began with Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s  After Smith s death in 1844  the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory  Today  most Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church   Some Mormons are also either independent or non practicing  The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah  and North America has more Mormons than any other continent  though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States   Mormons have developed a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history  During the 19th century  Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location  and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage  a form of religious polygamy  Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church  and many young Mormons choose to serve a full time proselytizing mission  Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages  tobacco  coffee  tea  and other addictive substances  They tend to be very family oriented  and have strong connections across generations and with extended family  reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death and throughout eternity  Mormons also have a strict law of chastity  requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of opposite sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage   Mormons self identify as Christian  though some of their beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity  Mormons believe in the Bible  as well as other books of scripture  such as the Book of Mormon  They have a unique view of cosmology  and believe that all people are spirit children of God  Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ  and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism  They believe that Christ s church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles  Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers   1  Terminology  The word  Mormons  most often refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church  because of their belief in the Book of Mormon  though members often refer to themselves as Latter day Saints or sometimes just Saints  The term  Mormons  has been embraced by most adherents of Mormonism  most notably Mormon fundamentalists  while other Latter Day Saint denominations  such as the Community of Christ  have rejected it  Both LDS Church members  or  Latter day Saints   and members of fundamentalist groups commonly use the word  Mormon  in reference to themselves  The LDS Church  however  disagrees with this self characterization  and encourages the use of the word  Mormon  only in reference to LDS Church members  Church leaders also encourage members to use the church s full name to emphasize its focus on Jesus Christ   The word  Mormon  is often associated with polygamy  or plural marriage   which was a distinguishing practice of many early Mormons  however it was renounced by the LDS Church in 1890 and discontinued over the next 15 years  Today  polygamy is practiced only by people that have broken with the LDS Church   2  History  The history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and communality  From the start  Mormons have tried to establish what they call  Zion   a utopian society of the righteous  Mormon history can be divided into three broad time periods   1  the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith   2  a  pioneer era  under the leadership of Brigham Young and his successors  and  3  a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century  In the first period  Smith had tried literally to build a city called Zion  in which converts could gather  During the pioneer era  Zion became a  landscape of villages  in Utah  In modern times  Zion is still an ideal  though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location   2 1  Beginnings  Mormons trace their origins to the visions that Joseph Smith reported having in the early 1820s while living in upstate New York  In 1823  Smith said an angel directed him to a buried book written on golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient people  Smith published what he said was a translation of these plates in March 1830 as the Book of Mormon  named after Mormon  the ancient prophet–historian who compiled the book  On April 6  1830  Smith founded the Church of Christ  The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to preach the restored gospel  In 1831  the church moved to Kirtland  Ohio where missionaries had made a large number of converts and Smith began establishing an outpost in Jackson County  Missouri  where he planned to eventually build the city of Zion  or the New Jerusalem   In 1833  Missouri settlers  alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons  expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby Clay County  where local residents took them in  After Smith led a mission  known as Zion s Camp  to recover the land  he began building Kirtland Temple in Lake County  Ohio  where the church flourished  When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836  they secured land in what would become Caldwell County   The Kirtland era ended in 1838  after the failure of a church sponsored bank caused widespread defections  and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West  Missouri  During the fall of 1838  tensions escalated into the Mormon War with the old Missouri settlers  On October 27  the governor of Missouri ordered that the Mormons  must be treated as enemies  and be exterminated or driven from the state  Between November and April  some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into Illinois   In 1839  the Mormons converted a swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River into Nauvoo  Illinois and began construction of the Nauvoo Temple  The city became the church s new headquarters and gathering place  and it grew rapidly  fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe  Meanwhile  Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to seal families together for eternity  as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or exaltation  and plural marriage  Smith created a service organization for women called the Relief Society  as well as an organization called the Council of Fifty  representing a future theodemocratic  Kingdom of God  on the earth  Smith also published the story of his First Vision  in which the Father and the Son appeared to him while he was about 14 years old  This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth  ministry  and resurrection of Jesus Christ   In 1844  local prejudices and political tensions  fueled by Mormon peculiarity and internal dissent  escalated into conflicts between Mormons and  anti Mormons   On June 27  1844  Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in Carthage  Illinois  Because Hyrum was Smith s logical successor  their deaths caused a succession crisis  and Brigham Young assumed leadership over the majority of Latter Day Saints  Young had been a close associate of Smith s and was senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve  Smaller groups of Latter Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement   2 2  Pioneer era  For two years after Smith s death  conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents  To prevent war  Brigham Young led the Mormon pioneers  constituting most of the Latter Day Saints  to a temporary winter quarters in Nebraska and then eventually  beginning in 1847  to what became the Utah Territory  Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society  the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation  based on their beliefs and values  The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the Mormon Corridor  Colonizing efforts were seen as religious duties  and the new villages were governed by the Mormon bishops  local lay religious leaders   The Mormons viewed land as commonwealth  devising and maintaining a co operative system of irrigation that allowed them to build a farming community in the desert   From 1849–52  the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts  establishing several missions in Europe  Latin America  and the South Pacific  Converts were expected to  gather  to Zion  and during Young s presidency  1847–77  over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America  Many of the converts came from England and Scandinavia  and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community  Many of these immigrants crossed the Great Plains in wagons drawn by oxen  while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts  During the 1860s  newcomers began using the new railroad that was under construction   In 1852  church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage  a form of polygamy  Over the next 50 years  many Mormons  between 20 and 30 percent of Mormon families  entered into plural marriages as a religious duty  with the number of plural marriages reaching a peak around 1860  and then declining through the rest of the century  Besides the doctrinal reasons for plural marriage  the practice made some economic sense  as many of the plural wives were single women who arrived in Utah without brothers or fathers to offer them societal support   By 1857  tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans  largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young  In 1857  U S  President James Buchanan sent an army to Utah  which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them  Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois  the Mormons prepared to defend themselves  determined to torch their own homes in the case that they were invaded  The relatively peaceful Utah War ensued from 1857 to 1858  in which the most notable instance of violence was the Mountain Meadows massacre  when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions  In 1858  Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non Mormon  Alfred Cumming  Nevertheless  the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory   At Young s death in 1877  he was followed by other LDS Church presidents  who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages  In 1878  the U S  Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v  United States that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy  and many Mormon polygamists went into hiding  later  Congress began seizing church assets  In September 1890  church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice of polygamy  Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages  relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890  such that Utah was admitted as a U S  state in 1896  After the Manifesto  some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages  but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F  Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a  Second Manifesto  calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease  Eventually  the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy  and today seeks actively to distance itself from  fundamentalist  groups that continue the practice   2 3  Modern times  During the early 20th century  Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream  In 1929  the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio  becoming an asset for public relations  Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry  rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle class  In the 1920s and 1930s  Mormons began migrating out of Utah  a trend hurried by the Great Depression  as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it  As Mormons spread out  church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight knit community feel of Mormon culture  In addition to weekly worship services  Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as Boy Scouting  a Young Women organization  church sponsored dances  ward basketball  camping trips  plays  and religious education programs for youth and college students  During the Great Depression  the church started a welfare program to meet the needs of poor members  which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims   During the latter half of the 20th century  there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative  attempting to regain their status as a  peculiar people   Though the 1960s and 1970s brought positive changes such as Women s Liberation and the Civil Rights Movement  Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values  the sexual revolution  the widespread use of recreational drugs  moral relativism  and other forces they saw as damaging to the family  Partly to counter this  Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life  religious education  and missionary work  becoming more conservative in the process  As a result  Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s   Although black people have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith s time  before 1978  black membership was small  From 1852 to 1978  the LDS Church had a policy against ordaining men of black African descent to the priesthood  The church had previously been criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement  but the change came in 1978 and was prompted primarily by problems facing mixed race converts in Brazil  In general  Mormons greeted the change with joy and relief  Since 1978  black membership has grown  and in 1997 there were approximately 500 000 black members of the church  about 5 percent of the total membership   mostly in Africa  Brazil and the Caribbean  Black membership has continued to grow substantially  especially in West Africa  where two temples have been built  Many black Mormons are members of the Genesis Group  an organization of black members that predates the priesthood ban  and is endorsed by the church   The LDS Church grew rapidly after World War II and became a world wide organization as missionaries were sent across the globe  The church doubled in size every 15 to 20 years  and by 1996  there were more Mormons outside the United States than inside  In 2012  there were an estimated 14 8 million Mormons  with roughly 57 percent living outside the United States  It is estimated that approximately 4 5 million Mormons   roughly 30% of the total membership   regularly attend services  A majority of U S  Mormons are white and non Hispanic  84 percent   Most Mormons are distributed in North and South America  the South Pacific  and Western Europe  The global distribution of Mormons resembles a contact diffusion model  radiating out from the organization s headquarters in Utah  The church enforces general doctrinal uniformity  and congregations on all continents teach the same doctrines  and international Mormons tend to absorb a good deal of Mormon culture  possibly because of the church s top down hierarchy and a missionary presence  However  international Mormons often bring pieces of their own heritage into the church  adapting church practices to local cultures   Chile  Uruguay  and several areas in the South Pacific have a higher percentage of Mormons than the United States  which is at about 2 percent   South Pacific countries and dependencies that are more than 10 percent Mormon include American Samoa  the Cook Islands  Kiribati  Niue  Samoa  and Tonga   3  Culture and practices  Isolation in Utah had allowed Mormons to create a culture of their own  As the faith spread around the world  many of its more distinctive practices followed  Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes  repent of their sins  and adopt sometimes foreign standards of conduct  Practices common to Mormons include studying the scriptures  praying daily  fasting on a regular basis  attending Sunday worship services  participating in church programs and activities on weekdays  and refraining from work on Sundays when possible  The most important part of the church services is considered to be the Lord s Supper  commonly called sacrament   in which church members renew covenants made at baptism  Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by Jesus Christ  including personal honesty  integrity  obedience to law  chastity outside of opposite sex marriage and fidelity within marriage   In 2010  around 13–14 percent of Mormons lived in Utah  the center of cultural influence for Mormonism  Utah Mormons  as well as Mormons living in the Intermountain West  are on average more culturally and or politically conservative than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U S  Utahns self identifying as Mormon also attend church somewhat more on average than Mormons living in other states   Nonetheless  whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U S   Mormons tend to be more culturally and or politically conservative than members of other U S  religious groups   Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers   Mormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history  LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church  The church is divided by locality into congregations called  wards   with several wards making up a  stake   The vast majority of church leadership positions are lay positions  and church members may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service  Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as tithing  and are often involved in humanitarian efforts  Many LDS young men choose to serve a two year proselytizing mission  during which they dedicate all of their time to the church  without pay   Mormons adhere to the Word of Wisdom  a health law or code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco  alcohol  coffee and tea  while encouraging the use of wholesome herbs  grains  fruits  and a moderate consumption of meat  The Word of Wisdom is also understood to forbid other harmful and addictive substances and practices  such as the use of illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs  Mormons also oppose addictive behavior such as viewing pornography and gambling   The concept of a united family that lives and progresses forever is at the core of Latter day Saint doctrine  and Mormons place a high importance on family life  Many Mormons hold weekly family home evenings  in which an evening is set aside for family bonding  study  prayer and other wholesome activities  Latter day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name  Mormon parents hope and pray that their children will gain testimonies of the  gospel  so they can grow up and marry in temples   Mormons have a strict law of chastity  requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of opposite sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage  All sexual activity  heterosexual and homosexual  outside of marriage is considered a serious sin  with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman  Same sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church  Church members are encouraged to marry and have children  and Latter day Saint families tend to be larger than average  Mormons are opposed to abortion  except in some exceptional circumstances  such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape  or when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy  Many practicing adult Mormons wear religious undergarments that remind them of covenants and encourage them to dress modestly  Latter day Saints are counseled not to partake of any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way  including media that depicts graphic representations of sex or violence  Tattoos and body piercings are also discouraged  with the exception of a single pair of earrings for LDS women   LGBT Mormons  or Mormons who self identify as gay  lesbian  or bisexual  remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from homosexual relations and obey the law of chastity  While there are no official numbers  LDS Family Services estimates that there are on average four or five members per LDS ward who experience same sex attraction  Gary Watts  former president of Family Fellowship  estimates that only 10 percent of homosexuals stay in the church  Many of these individuals have come forward through different support groups or websites discussing their homosexual attractions and concurrent church membership   4  Groups within Mormonism  4 1  Latter day Saints  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  LDS Church   formally known as Latter day Saints  constitute over 99 percent of Mormons  The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of LDS Church leaders  There are  however  several smaller groups that differ from  mainstream  Mormonism in various ways   LDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called  less active   akin to the qualifying expressions non observant or non practicing used in relation to members of other religious groups   The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity  but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services  Reasons for inactivity can include lifestyle issues and problems with social integration  Activity rates tend to vary with age  and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25  A majority of less active members return to church activity later in life  Former Latter day Saints who seek to disassociate themselves from the religion are often referred to as ex Mormons   4 2  Fundamentalist Mormons  Members of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as fundamentalist Mormons  these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of plural marriage  There are thought to be between 20 000 and 60 000 members of fundamentalist sects   0 1–0 4 percent of Mormons   with roughly half of them practicing polygamy  There are a number of fundamentalist sects  the largest two being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  FLDS Church  and the Apostolic United Brethren  AUB   In addition to plural marriage  some of these groups also practice a form of Christian communalism known as the law of consecration or the United Order  The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups  excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it  and today a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church   4 3  Liberal Mormons  Liberal Mormons  also known as Progressive Mormons  take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture  They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance  but do not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true  For liberal Mormons  revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding  Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly  In a separate context  members of minuscule  progressive  breakaway groups have also adopted the label Liberal Mormon   4 4  Cultural Mormons  Cultural Mormons are individuals who do not believe some  or many  of the doctrines of LDS Church  but who self identify as Mormon  Usually this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith  or as having converted and spent a large portion of one s life as an active member of the LDS Church  Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church  and in some cases may not even be officially members of the church   5  Beliefs  Mormons have a scriptural canon consisting of the Bible  both Old and New Testaments   the Book of Mormon  and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price  Mormons however have a relatively open definition of scripture  As a general rule  anything spoken or written by a prophet  while under inspiration  is considered to be the word of God  Thus  the Bible  written by prophets  is the word of God  so far as it is translated correctly  The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets  and is viewed as a companion to the Bible  By this definition  the teachings of Smith s successors are also accepted as scripture  though they are always measured against  and draw heavily from the scriptural canon   Mormons believe in  a friendly universe   governed by a God whose work and glory it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life  Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God  the origin of man  and the purpose of life  For instance  Mormons believe in a pre mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God  and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him  The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn  progress  and receive a  fulness of joy   The most important part of the plan involved Jesus  the eldest of God s children  coming to earth as the literal Son of God  to conquer sin and death so that God s other children could return  According to Mormons  every person who lives on earth will be resurrected  and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory  To be accepted into the highest kingdom  a person must fully accept Christ through faith  repentance  and through ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands   According to Mormons  a deviation from the original principles of Christianity  known as the Great Apostasy  began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ  It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies  with followers dividing into different ideological groups  Mormons claim the martyrdom of the Apostles led to a loss of Priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances  Mormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith  In particular  Mormons believe that angels such as Peter  James  John  John the Baptist  Moses  and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them  Mormons believe that their church is the  only true and living church  because of the divine authority restored through Smith  Mormons self identify as being Christian  while many Christians  particularly evangelical Protestants  disagree with this view  Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth  doing good works  and having genuine value   Though the LDS Church has a top down hierarchical structure with a president–prophet dictating revelations for the whole church  there is a bottom up aspect as well  Ordinary Mormons have access to the same inspiration that is thought to guide their prophets  and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations  Mormons see Joseph Smith s first vision as proof that the heavens are open  and that God answers prayers  They place considerable emphasis on  asking God  to find out if something is true  Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith s in response to prayers  but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost  Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world  they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them   6  See also  List of Latter Day Saints  List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement  Followers of Brigham
