Andreas Vesalius  31 December 1514 舑 15 October 1564  was a Brussels  in modern day Belgium  anatomist  physician  and author of one of the most influential books on human anatomy  De humani corporis fabrica  On the Fabric of the Human Body   Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy  He was professor at the University of Padua and later became Imperial physician at the court of Emperor Charles V   Andreas Vesalius is the Latinized form of the Dutch Andries van Wesel  a common practice among European scholars in his time  His name is also given as Andrea Vesalius  Andrea Vesalio  Andreas Vesal  André Vesalio and Andre Vesalepo   1  Medical career  The day of his graduation he was immediately offered the chair of Surgery and Anatomy  explicator chirurgiae  at Padua  He also guest lectured at Bologna and Pisa  Prior to arriving in Padua  Vesalius traveled through Italy  and assisted the future Pope Paul IV and Ignatius of Loyola healing those afflicted by Hansen’s disease  leprosy   In Venice  he met his illustrator Johan van Calcar  a student of Titian  with whom their first anatomical text Tabulae Sex published in AD 1538   Previously these topics had been taught primarily from reading classical texts  mainly Galen  followed by an animal dissection by a barber surgeon whose work was directed by the lecturer  No attempt was made to actually check Galen s claims  these were considered unassailable  Vesalius  on the other hand  carried out dissection as the primary teaching tool  handling the actual work himself and urging students to perform dissection themselves  Hands on direct observation was considered the only reliable resource  a huge break with medieval practice   He created detailed illustrations of anatomy for students in the form of six large woodcut anatomical posters  When he found that some of these were being widely copied  he published them all in 1538 under the title Tabulae anatomicae sex  He followed this in 1539 with an updated version of Guinter s anatomical handbook  Institutiones anatomicae   In 1539 he also published his Venesection letter  on bloodletting  This was a popular treatment for almost any illness  but there was some debate about where to take the blood from  The classical Greek procedure  advocated by Galen  was to let blood from a site near the location of the illness  However  the Muslim and medieval practice was to draw a smaller amount blood from a distant location  Vesalius  pamphlet generally supported Galen s view  but with qualifications that rejected the infallibility of Galen   In 1541  while in Bologna  Vesalius uncovered the fact that all of Galen s research had been based upon animal anatomy rather than the human  since dissection had been banned in ancient Rome  Galen had dissected Barbary apes instead  and argued that they would be anatomically similar to humans  He also contributed to the new Giunta edition of Galen s collected works and began writing his own anatomical text  Until Vesalius pointed out Galen s substitution of animal for human anatomy  it had gone unnoticed and had long been the basis of studying human anatomy  However  some people still chose to follow Galen and resented Vesalius for calling attention to such glaring mistakes   Galen assumed arteries carried the purest blood to higher organs such as the brain and lungs from the left ventricle of the heart  while veins carried blood to the lesser organs such as the stomach from the right ventricle  In order that this theory could be correct some sort of holes were needed to interconnect the ventricles  and so in the spirit of Galen s time  he claimed to have found them  adjusting the facts to suit his theory  So paramount was the authority of Galen that for 1400 years a succession of anatomists had claimed to find these holes until finally Vesalius admitted he could not find them  However  while Vesalius dared to admit he could not find these holes  he did not dream of disputing Galen on the distribution of blood  and so imagined it distilled through the unbroken partition between the ventricles   Other famous examples of Vesalius disproving Galen in particular was his discovery that the lower jaw  mandible  was only one bone  not two  which Galen had assumed from animal dissection  and his proof that humans do not have the  miraculous network  of blood vessels at the base of the brain which is found in sheep and other ungulates   In 1543  Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of   a notorious felon from the city of Basel  Switzerland  He assembled the bones and finally donated the skeleton to the University of Basel  This preparation   The Basel Skeleton   is Vesalius  only well preserved skeletal preparation today  and is also the world s oldest surviving anatomical preparation  It is still displayed at the Anatomical Museum of the University of Basel   In the same year Vesalius took residence in Basel to help Johannes Oporinus publish the seven volume De humani corporis fabrica  On the fabric of the human body   a groundbreaking work of human anatomy which he dedicated to Charles V  Many believe it was illustrated by Titian s pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar  but evidence is lacking  and it is unlikely a single artist created all 273 illustrations in so short a time  About the same time he published an abridged edition for students  Andrea Vesalii suorum de humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome  and dedicated it to Philip II of Spain  son of the Emperor   Though Vesalius  work was not the first such work based on actual autopsy  nor even the first work of this era  the production values  highly detailed and intricate plates  and the likelihood that the artists who produced it were clearly present at the dissections themselves made it into an instant classic  Pirated editions were available almost immediately  a fact Vesalius acknowledged would happen in a printer s note  Vesalius was 28 years old when the first edition of Fabrica was published   2  Imperial physician and death  Soon after publication  Vesalius was invited as Imperial physician to the court of Emperor Charles V  He informed the Venetian Senate that he was leaving his post in Padua  which prompted Duke Cosimo I de  Medici to invite him to move to the expanding university in Pisa  which he turned down  Vesalius took up a position in the court  where he had to deal with the other physicians mocking him as being a barber   Over the next eleven years Vesalius traveled with the court  treating injuries from battle or tournaments  performing postmortems  administering medications  and writing private letters addressing specific medical questions  During these years he also wrote the Epistle on the China root  a short text on the properties of a medical plant whose efficacy he doubted  as well as defense of his anatomical findings  This elicited a new round of attacks on his work that called for him to be punished by the emperor  In 1551  Charles V commissioned an inquiry in Salamanca to investigate the religious implications of his methods  Vesalius  work was cleared by the board  but the attacks continued  Four years later one of his main detractors and one time professors Jacobus Sylvius  published an article that claimed that the human body itself had changed since Galen had studied it   After the abdication of Emperor Charles V he continued at court in great favor with his son Philip II  who rewarded him with a pension for life by making him a count palatine  In 1555 he published a revised edition of De humani corporis fabrica   In 1564 Vesalius went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land  He sailed with the Venetian fleet under James Malatesta via Cyprus  When he reached Jerusalem  he received a message from the Venetian senate requesting him again to accept the Paduan professorship  which had become vacant by the death of his friend and pupil Fallopius   After struggling for many days with the adverse winds in the Ionian Sea  he was wrecked on the island of Zakynthos  Here he soon died in such debt that a benefactor kindly paid for his funeral  At the time of his death he was scarcely fifty years of age  He was buried somewhere in the island of Korfu   For many years it was assumed that Vesalius s pilgrimage was due to pressures of the Inquisition  Today this is generally considered to be without foundation  see C D  O Malley Andreas Vesalius  Pilgrimage  Isis 45 2  1954  and is dismissed by modern biographers  It appears the story was spread by Hubert Languet  a diplomat under Emperor Charles V and then under the Prince of Orange  who claimed in 1565 that Vesalius had performed an autopsy on an aristocrat in Spain when the heart was still beating  leading to the Inquisition condemning him to death  The story went on to claim that Philip II had the sentence commuted to a pilgrimage  The story re surfaced several times over the next few years  living on until recent times   3  Publications  3 1  De Corporis Fabrica  In 1543  Vesalius asked Johannes Oporinus to publish the seven volume De humani corporis fabrica  On the fabric of the human body   a groundbreaking work of human anatomy he dedicated to Charles V and which many believe was illustrated by Titian s pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar  though others believe it was illustrated by different artists working in the studio of Titian  and not from Van Calcar himself   About the same time he published another version of his great work  entitled De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome  Abridgement of the Structure of the Human Body  more commonly known as the Epitome  with a stronger focus on illustrations than text  so as to help readers easily understand his findings  The actual text of the Epitome was an abridged form of his work in the Fabrica  and the organization of the two books was quite varied  He dedicated it to Philip II of Spain  son of the Emperor   The Fabrica emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the  anatomical  view of the body  seeing human internal functioning as an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three dimensional space  This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously  which had strong Galenic Aristotelean elements  as well as elements of astrology  Although modern anatomical texts had been published by Mondino and Berenger  much of their work was clouded by their reverence for Galen and Arabian doctrines   Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone  he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six  and described accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone  He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins  but he described the vena azygos  and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava  since named ductus venosus  He described the omentum  and its connections with the stomach  the spleen and the colon  gave the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus  observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man  gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain yet advanced  He did not understand the inferior recesses  and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair  the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh   In this work  Vesalius also becomes the first person to describe mechanical ventilation  It is largely this achievement that has resulted in Vesalius being incorporated into the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists college

lower end of the noose I run through a pulley fixed to a beam in the room so that I may raise or lower the cadaver as it hangs there or turn around in any direction to suit my purpose      You must take care not to put the noose around the neck  unless some of the muscles connected to the occipital bone have already been cut away      —Andreas Vesalius  595 2 of Bynum & Porter  Oxford Dictionary

axillary vein of the right elbow be cut   commonly known as the Venesection Letter  which demonstrated a revived venesection  a classical procedure in which blood was drawn near the site of the ailment  He sought to locate the precise site for venesection in pleurisy within the framework of the classical method  The real significance of the book is his attempt to support his arguments by the location and continuity of the venous system from his observations rather than appeal to earlier published works  With this novel approach to the problem of venesection  Vesalius posed the then striking hypothesis that anatomical dissection might be used to test speculation   In 1546  three years after the Fabrica  he wrote his Epistola rationem modumque propinandi radicis Chynae decocti  commonly known as the Epistle on the China Root  Ostensibly an appraisal of a popular but ineffective treatment for gout  syphilis  and stone  this work is especially important as a continued polemic against Galenism and a reply to critics in the camp of his former professor Jacobus Sylvius  now an obsessive detractor   In February 1561  Vesalius was given a copy of Gabriele Fallopio s Observationes anatomicae  friendly additions and corrections to the Fabrica  Before the end of the year Vesalius composed a cordial reply  Anatomicarum Gabrielis Fallopii observationum examen  generally referred to as the Examen  In this work he recognizes in Fallopio a true equal in the science of dissection he had done so much to create  Vesalius  reply to Fallopio was published in May 1564  a month after Vesalius  death on the Greek island of Zante  mod  Zakynthos    4  Scientific findings  4 1  Skeletal system  Vesalius believed the skeletal system to be the framework of the human body  It was in this opening chapter  or book  of De fabrica that Vesalius made several of his strongest claims against Galen s theories and writings which he had put in his anatomy books  In his extensive study of the skull  Vesalius claimed that the mandible consisted of one bone  whereas Galen had thought it was two separate bones  He accurately described the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone of the skull   In Galen s observation of the ape  he had discovered that their sternum consisted of seven parts which he assumed held true for humans  Vesalius discovered that the human sternum only consisted of three parts   He also disproved the common belief that men had one rib fewer than women and noted that fibula and tibia bones of the leg were indeed larger than the humerus bone of the arm  unlike Galen s original findings   4 2  Muscular system  Vesalius  most impressive contribution to the study of the muscular system may be the illustrations that accompany the text in De fabrica  which would become known as the  muscle men   He describes the source and position of each muscle of the body as well as providing information on their respective operations   4 3  Vascular and circulatory systems  Vesalius  work on the vascular and circulatory systems was his greatest contribution to the complex and modern medicine  In his dissections of the heart  Vesalius became convinced that Galen s claims of a porous Interventricular septum were false This fact was previously described by Michael Servetus  fellow of Vesalius  but never reached the public  for it was written down in the  Manuscript of Paris   in 1546  and just published later in his Christianismi Restitutio  1553   an heretic book for the Inquisition  Vesalius published in the second edition that the septum was indeed waterproof  discovering  and naming   the mitral valve to explain the blood flow   Vesalius believed that the cardiac systole is synchronous with the arterial pulse   He not only verified Estienne s findings on the valves of the hepatic veins  but he described the Azygos  and discovered the canal which passes into the fetus between the umbilical vein and vena cava   4 4  Nervous system  Vesalius defined a nerve as the mode of transmitting sensation and motion and thus refuted his contemporaries  claims that ligaments  tendons and aponeuroses were three types of nerve units  He believed that nerves do not originate from the heart  as was the Aristotelian belief  but that nerves stemmed from the brain   Upon studying the optic nerve  Vesalius came to the conclusion that nerves were not hollow   4 5  Abdominal organs  In De fabrica  he corrected an earlier claim he made in Tabulae about the right kidney being set higher than the left  Vesalius claimed that the kidneys were not a filter device for the urine to pass through but rather that the kidneys serve to filter blood as well and that the excrement then traveled through the ureters to the bladder   He described the omentum  and its connections with the stomach  the spleen and the colon gave the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus   He also observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man and gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura   Vesalius admitted that due to a lack of pregnant cadavers  he was unable to come to a significant understanding of the reproductive organs  However  he did find that the uterus had been falsely identified as having two distinct sections   4 6  Heart  Through his work with muscles  Vesalius believed that a criterion for muscles was their voluntary motion  On this claim  he deduced that the heart was not a true muscle due to its obvious involuntary nature of its motion   He identified two chambers and two atria  The right atrium was considered a continuation of the inferior and superior venae cavae and the left atrium was considered a continuation of the pulmonary vein   Interestingly  he also addressed the controversial issue of the heart being the centre of the soul  He wished to avoid making any conclusions due to the possible conflict with contemporary religious beliefs   Against Galen s theory and many beliefs he also discovered that there was no hole in the septum or heart   4 7  Miscellaneous  Vesalius introduced the notion of induction of the extraction of empyema through surgical means   Due to his impressive study of the human skull and the variations of its features he is said to have been responsible for the launch of the study of physical anthropology   Vesalius always encouraged his students to check their findings  and even his own findings  so that they could better understand the structure of the human body   In addition to his continual efforts to study anatomy he also worked on medicinal remedies and came to such conclusions as treating syphilis with chinaroot   Vesalius believed that the brain and the nervous system are center of the mind and emotion in contrast to the common Aristotelian belief that the heart was the center of the body   Claimed medicine was arranged into three parts  drugs  diet  and  the use of hands    mainly suggesting surgery and the knowledge of anatomy and physiology through dissection   Vesalius was a supporter of  parallel dissections  in which an animal cadaver and a human cadaver are dissected simultaneously in order to demonstrate the anatomical differences and thus uncover Galenic errors   5  Scientific and historical impact  The influence of Vesalius  plates representing the partial dissections of the human figure posing in a landscape setting is apparent in the anatomical plates prepared by the Baroque painter Pietro da Cortona  1596–1669   who executed anatomical plates with figures in dramatic poses  most with architectural or landscape backdrops   During the 20th century  the American artist  Jacob Lawrence created his Vesalius Suite based on the anatomical drawings of Andreas Vesalius   6  See also
