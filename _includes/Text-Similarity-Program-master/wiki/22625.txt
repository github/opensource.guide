Organized crime  organised crime and criminal organizations are terms which categorise transnational  national  or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals  who intend to engage in illegal activity  most commonly for monetary profit  Some criminal organizations  such as terrorist organizations  are politically motivated  Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them  as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so called  protection   Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered organized  An organized gang or criminal set can also be referred to as a mob   Other organizations—including states  militaries  police forces  and corporations—may sometimes use organized crime methods to conduct their business  but their powers derive from their status as formal social institutions  There is a tendency to distinguish organized crime from other forms of crimes  such as  white collar crime  financial crimes  political crimes  war crime  state crimes and treason  This distinction is not always apparent and the academic debate is ongoing  For example  in failed states that can no longer perform basic functions such as education  security  or governance  usually due to fractious violence or extreme poverty  organised crime  governance and war are often complementary to each other  The term Parliamentary Mafiocracy is often attributed to democratic countries whose political  social and economic institutions are under the control of few families and business oligarchs   In the United States  the Organized Crime Control Act  1970  defines organized crime as  The unlawful activities of       a highly organized  disciplined association         Criminal activity as a structured group is referred to as racketeering and such crime is commonly referred to as the work of the Mob  In the UK  police estimate organized crime involves up to 38 000 people operating in 6 000 various groups  In addition  due to the escalating violence of Mexico s drug war  the Mexican drug cartels are considered the  greatest organized crime threat to the United States  according to a report issued by the United States Department of Justice   1  Models  1 1  Causal  The demand for illegal goods and services nurtures the emergence of ever more centralized and powerful criminal syndicates  who may ultimately succeed in undermining public morals  neutralizing law enforcement through corruption and infiltrating the legal economy unless appropriate countermeasures are taken  This theoretical proposition can be depicted in a model comprising four elements  government  society  illegal markets and organized crime  While interrelations are acknowledged in both directions between the model elements  in the last instance the purpose is to explain variations in the power and reach of organized crime in the sense of an ultimately unified organizational entity   1 2  Organizational  1 2 1  Patron client networks  Patron client networks are defined by the fluid interactions they produce  Organized crime groups operate as smaller units within the overall network  and as such tend towards valuing significant others  familiarity of social and economic environments  or tradition  These networks are usually composed of   Hierarchies based on  naturally  forming family  social and cultural traditions    Tight knit  locus of activity labor   Fraternal or nepotistic value systems   Personalized activity  including family rivalries  territorial disputes  recruitment and training of family members  etc    Entrenched belief systems  reliance of tradition  including religion  family values  cultural expectations  class politics  gender roles  etc    and   Communication and rule enforcement mechanisms dependent on organizational structure  social etiquette  history of criminal involvement  and collective decision making   1 2 2  Bureaucratic corporate operations  Bureaucratic corporate organized crime groups are defined by the general rigidity of their internal structures  Focusing more on how the operations works  succeeds  sustains itself or avoids retribution  they are generally typified by   A complex authority structure   An extensive division of labor between classes within the organization   Meritocratic  as opposed to cultural or social attributes    Responsibilities carried out in an impersonal manner   Extensive written rules regulations  as opposed to cultural praxis dictating action   and    Top down  communication and rule enforcement mechanisms  However  this model of operation has some flaws   The  top down  communication strategy is susceptible to interception  more so further down the hierarchy being communicated to   Maintaining written records jeopardizes the security of the organization and relies on increased security measures   Infiltration at lower levels in the hierarchy can jeopardize the entire organization  a  house of cards  effect   and   Death  injury  incarceration or internal power struggles dramatically heighten the insecurity of operations  While bureaucratic operations emphasize business processes and strongly authoritarian hierarchies  these are based on enforcing power relationships rather than an overlying aim of protectionism  sustainability or growth   1 2 3  Youth and street gangs  A distinctive gang culture underpins many  but not all  organized groups  this may develop through recruiting strategies  social learning processes in the corrective system experienced by youth  family or peer involvement in crime  and the coercive actions of criminal authority figures  The term “street gang” is commonly used interchangeably with “youth gang ” referring to neighborhood or street based youth groups that meet “gang” criteria  Miller  1992  defines a street gang as “a self formed association of peers  united by mutual interests  with identifiable leadership and internal organization  who act collectively or as individuals to achieve specific purposes  including the conduct of illegal activity and control of a particular territory  facility  or enterprise     Zones of transition  refer to deteriorating neighborhoods with shifting populations   conflict between groups  fighting   turf wars   and theft promotes solidarity and cohesion  Cohen  1955   working class teenagers joined gangs due to frustration of inability to achieve status and goals of the middle class  Cloward and Ohlin  1960   blocked opportunity  but unequal distribution of opportunities lead to creating different types of gangs  that is  some focused on robbery and property theft  some on fighting and conflict and some were retreatists focusing on drug taking   Spergel  1966  was one of the first criminologists to focus on evidence based practice rather than intuition into gang life and culture  Klein  1971  like Spergel studied the effects on members of social workers’ interventions  More interventions actually lead to greater gang participation and solidarity and bonds between members  Downes and Rock  1988  on Parker’s analysis  strain theory applies  labeling theory  from experience with police and courts   control theory  involvement in trouble from early childhood and the eventual decision that the costs outweigh the benefits  and conflict theories  No ethnic group is more disposed to gang involvement than another  rather it is the status of being marginalized  alienated or rejected that makes some groups more vulnerable to gang formation  and this would also be accounted for in the effect of social exclusion  especially in terms of recruitment and retention  These may also be defined by age  typically youth  or peer group influences  and the permanence or consistency of their criminal activity  These groups also form their own symbolic identity or public representation which are recognizable by the community at large  include colors  symbols  patches  flags and tattoos    Research has focused on whether the gangs have formal structures  clear hierarchies and leadership in comparison with adult groups  and whether they are rational in pursuit of their goals  though positions on structures  hierarchies and defined roles are conflicting  Some studied street gangs involved in drug dealing   finding that their structure and behavior had a degree of organizational rationality  Members saw themselves as organized criminals  gangs were formal rational organizations  Strong organizational structures  well defined roles and rules that guided members’ behavior  Also a specified and regular means of income  i e  drugs   Padilla  1992  agreed with the two above  However some have found these to be loose rather than well defined and lacking persistent focus  there was relatively low cohesion  few shared goals and little organizational structure  Shared norms  value and loyalties were low  structures  chaotic   little role differentiation or clear distribution of labor  Similarly  the use of violence does not conform to the principles behind protection rackets  political intimidation and drug trafficking activities employed by those adult groups  In many cases gang members graduate from youth gangs to highly developed OC groups  with some already in contact with such syndicates and through this we see a greater propensity for imitation  Gangs and traditional criminal organizations cannot be universally linked  Decker  1998   however there are clear benefits to both the adult and youth organization through their association  In terms of structure  no single crime group is archetypal  though in most cases there are well defined patterns of vertical integration  where criminal groups attempt to control the supply and demand   as is the case in arms  sex and drug trafficking   1 3  Individual difference  1 3 1  Entrepreneurial  The entrepreneurial model looks at either the individual criminal  or a smaller group of organized criminals  that capitalize off the more fluid  group association  of contemporary organized crime  This model conforms to social learning theory or differential association in that there are clear associations and interaction between criminals where knowledge may be shared  or values enforced  however it is argued that rational choice is not represented in this  The choice to commit a certain act  or associate with other organized crime groups  may be seen as much more of an entrepreneurial decision   contributing to the continuation of a criminal enterprise  by maximizing those aspects that protect or support their own individual gain  In this context  the role of risk is also easily understandable  however it is debatable whether the underlying motivation should be seen as true entrepreneurship or entrepreneurship as a product of some social disadvantage   The criminal organization  much in the same way as one would assess pleasure and pain  weighs such factors as legal  social and economic risk to determine potential profit and loss from certain criminal activities  This decision making process rises from the entrepreneurial efforts of the group s members  their motivations and the environments in which they work  Opportunism is also a key factor – the organized criminal or criminal group is likely to frequently reorder the criminal associations they maintain  the types of crimes they perpetrate  and how they function in the public arena  recruitment  reputation  etc   in order to ensure efficiency  capitalization and protection of their interests   1 4  Multimodel approach  Culture and ethnicity provide an environment where trust and communication between criminals can be efficient and secure  This may ultimately lead to a competitive advantage for some groups  however it is inaccurate to adopt this as the only determinant of classification in organized crime  This categorization includes the Sicilian Mafia  Jamaican posses  Colombian drug trafficking groups  Nigerian organized crime groups  Corsican mafia  Japanese Yakuza  or Boryokudan   Korean criminal groups and ethnic Chinese criminal groups  From this perspective  organized crime is not a modern phenomenon   the construction of 17th and 18th century crime gangs fulfill all the present day criteria of criminal organizations  in opposition to the Alien Conspiracy Theory   These roamed the rural borderlands of central Europe embarking on many of the same illegal activities associated with today’s crime organizations  with the exception of money laundering  When the French revolution created strong nation states  the criminal gangs moved to other poorly controlled regions like the Balkans and Southern Italy  where the seeds were sown for the Sicilian Mafia   the lynchpin of organized crime in the New World   2  Typical activities  Organized crime often victimize businesses through the use of extortion or theft and fraud activities like hijacking cargo trucks  robbing goods  committing bankruptcy fraud  also known as  bust out    insurance fraud or stock fraud  inside trading   Organized crime groups also victimize individuals by car theft  either for dismantling at  chop shops  or for export   art theft  bank robbery  burglary  jewelery theft  computer hacking  credit card fraud  economic espionage  embezzlement  identity theft  and securities fraud   pump and dump  scam   Some organized crime groups defraud national  state  or local governments by bid rigging public projects  counterfeiting money  smuggling or manufacturing untaxed alcohol  bootlegging  or cigarettes  buttlegging   and providing immigrant workers to avoid taxes   Organized crime groups seek out corrupt public officials in executive  law enforcement  and judicial roles so that their activities can avoid  or at least receive early warnings about  investigation and prosecution   Organized crime groups also provide a range of illegal services and goods  such as loansharking of money at very high interest rates  assassination  blackmailing  bombings  bookmaking and illegal gambling  confidence tricks  copyright infringement  counterfeiting of intellectual property  fencing  kidnapping  prostitution  smuggling  drug trafficking  arms trafficking  oil smuggling  antiquities smuggling  organ trafficking  contract killing  identity document forgery  money laundering  point shaving  price fixing  illegal dumping of toxic waste  illegal trading of nuclear materials  military equipment smuggling  nuclear weapons smuggling  passport fraud  providing illegal immigration and cheap labor  people smuggling  trading in endangered species  and trafficking in human beings  Organized crime groups also do a range of business and labor racketeering activities  such as skimming casinos  insider trading  setting up monopolies in industries such as garbage collecting  construction and cement pouring  bid rigging  getting  no show  and  no work  jobs  political corruption and bullying   2 1  Violence  2 1 1  Assault  The commission of violent crime may form part of a criminal organization s  tools  used to achieve criminogenic goals  for example  its threatening  authoritative  coercive  terror inducing  or rebellious role   due to psychosocial factors  cultural conflict  aggression  rebellion against authority  access to illicit substances  counter cultural dynamic   or may  in and of itself  be crime rationally chosen by individual criminals and the groups they form  Assaults are used for coercive measures  to  rough up  debtors  competition or recruits  in the commission of robberies  in connection to other property offenses  and as an expression of counter cultural authority  violence is normalized within criminal organizations  in direct opposition to mainstream society  and the locations they control  Whilst the intensity of violence is dependent on the types of crime the organization is involved in  as well as their organizational structure or cultural tradition  aggressive acts range on a spectrum from low grade physical assaults to murder  Bodily harm and grievous bodily harm  within the context of organized crime  must be understood as indicators of intense social and cultural conflict  motivations contrary to the security of the public  and other psychosocial factors   2 1 2  Murder  Murder has evolved from the honor and vengeance killings of the Yakuza or Sicilian mafia which placed large physical and symbolic importance on the act of murder  its purposes and consequences  to a much less discriminate form of expressing power  enforcing criminal authority  achieving retribution or eliminating competition  The role of the hit man has been generally consistent throughout the history of organized crime  whether that be due to the efficiency or expediency of hiring a professional assassin or the need to distance oneself from the commission of murderous acts  making it harder to prove liability   This may include the assassination of notable figures  public  private or criminal   once again dependent on authority  retribution or competition  Revenge killings  armed robberies  violent disputes over controlled territories and offenses against members of the public must also be considered when looking at the dynamic between different criminal organizations and their  at times  conflicting needs   2 1 3  Ideological crime  In addition to what is considered traditional organized crime involving direct crimes of fraud swindles  scams  racketeering and other Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  RICO  predicate acts motivated for the accumulation of monetary gain  there is also non traditional organized crime which is engaged in for political or ideological gain or acceptance  Such crime groups are often labeled terrorist organizations   There is no universally agreed  legally binding  criminal law definition of terrorism  Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear  terror   are perpetrated for a religious  political or ideological goal  deliberately target or disregard the safety of non combatants  e g   neutral military personnel or civilians   and are committed by non government agencies  Some definitions also include acts of unlawful violence and war  especially crimes against humanity  See The Nuremberg Trials   Allied authorities deeming the German Nazi Party  its paramilitary and police organizations  and numerous associations subsidiary to the Nazi Party  criminal organizations   The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group   Notable groups include Al Qaeda  Animal Liberation Front  Army of God  Black Liberation Army  The Covenant  The Sword  and the Arm of the Lord  Earth Liberation Front  Irish Republican Army  Kurdistan Workers  Party  Lashkar e Toiba  May 19th Communist Organization  The Order  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  Symbionese Liberation Army  Taliban  United Freedom Front and Weather Underground  Nazi and Fascist parties are outlawed in many countries   2 1 4  Other  Arms trafficking  Arson  Coercion  Extortion  Protection racket  Sexual assault  2 2  Financial crime  Organized crime groups generate large amounts of money by activities such as drug trafficking  arms smuggling and financial crime  This is of little use to them unless they can disguise it and convert it into funds that are available for investment into legitimate enterprise  The methods they use for converting its ‘dirty’ money into ‘clean’ assets encourages corruption  Organized crime groups need to hide the money’s illegal origin  It allows for the expansion of OC groups  as the ‘laundry’ or ‘wash cycle’ operates to cover the money trail and convert proceeds of crime into usable assets  Money laundering is bad for international and domestic trade  banking reputations and for effective governments and rule of law  Accurate figures for the amounts of criminal proceeds laundered are almost impossible to calculate  and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering  FATF   an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering  has stated that  overall it is absolutely impossible to produce a reliable estimate of the amount of money laundered and therefore the FATF does not publish any figures in this regard   However in the US estimated figures of money laundering have been put at between $200 – $600 billion per year throughout the 1990s  US Congress Office 1995  Robinson 1996   and in 2002 this was estimated between $500 billion to $1 trillion per year  UN 2002   This would make organized crime the third largest business in world after foreign exchange and oil  Robinson 1996   The rapid growth of money laundering is due to   the scale of organized crime precluding it from being a cash business   groups have little option but to convert its proceeds into legitimate funds and do so by investment  by developing legitimate businesses and purchasing property   globalization of communications and commerce   technology has made rapid transfer of funds across international borders much easier  with groups continuously changing techniques to avoid investigation  and   a lack of effective financial regulation in parts of the global economy  Money Laundering is a three stage process   Placement   also called immersion  groups ‘smurf’ small amounts at a time to avoid suspicion  physical disposal of money by moving crime funds into the legitimate financial system  may involve bank complicity  mixing licit and illicit funds  cash purchases and smuggling currency to safe havens   Layering  disguises the trail to foil pursuit  Also called ‘heavy soaping’  It involves creating false paper trails  converting cash into assets by cash purchases   Integration   also called ‘spin dry   Making it into clean taxable income by real estate transactions  sham loans  foreign bank complicity and false import and export transactions  Means of money laundering   Money transmitters  black money markets purchasing goods  gambling  increasing the complexity of the money trail   Underground banking  flying money   involves clandestine ‘bankers’ around the world   It often involves otherwise legitimate banks and professionals  The policy aim in this area is to make the financial markets transparent  and minimize the circulation of criminal money and its cost upon legitimate markets   Remittance services  In addition to ordinary banking  however  money and other forms of value can be transferred through the use of so called  remittance services  which have operated for hundreds of years in non Western societies  Originating in southeast Asia and India  users of these systems transfer funds through the use of agents who enter into agreements with each other to receive money from people in one country  such as overseas workers  and to pay money to specified relatives or friends in other countries without having to rely on conventional banking arrangements  Funds can be moved quickly  cheaply and securely between locations that often don t have established banking networks or modern forms of electronic funds transfers available  Because such systems operate outside conventional banking systems  they are known as  alternative remittance    underground  or  parallel banking  systems  They are invariably legitimate and legal in many countries  although concerns have arisen in the recent decade that they could be used to circumvent anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing controls that now operate across the global financial services sector  Particular risks arise from the irregular forms of record keeping which are often employed and the possibility that the laws of those countries in which they operate may not be fully complied with   Alternative remittance  is only one of a number of terms used to describe the practice of transferring value  including money  from one country to another  It is generally used where value is sent through  informal  channels  as distinct from conventional banks  Terms used in other jurisdictions include hundi  hawala  poe kuan  informal funds transfer  underground banking  parallel banking  informal funds transfer and money value transfer  The remittance system predates modern banking and arose in various locations including China  southeast Asia and the Middle East where there was a need to move value without taking the risk of physically moving money itself  At its most basic  a remittance service involves a sender  a beneficiary and two intermediaries  The sender wishes to send a remittance to the beneficiary  often in the country of origin where the sender previously resided   2 2 1  Counterfeiting  In 2007  the OECD reported the scope of counterfeit products to include food  pharmaceuticals  pesticides  electrical components  tobacco and even household cleaning products in addition to the usual films  music  literature  games and other electrical appliances  software and fashion  A number of qualitative changes in the trade of counterfeit products   a large increase in fake goods which are dangerous to health and safety   most products repossessed by authorities are now household items rather than luxury goods   a growing number of technological products  and   production is now operated on an industrial scale   2 2 2  Tax evasion  The economic effects of organized crime have been approached from a number of both theoretical and empirical positions  however the nature of such activity allows for misrepresentation  The level of taxation taken by a nation state  rates of unemployment  mean household incomes and level of satisfaction with government and other economic factors all contribute to the likelihood of criminals to participate in tax evasion  As most organized crime is perpetrated in the liminal state between legitimate and illegitimate markets  these economic factors must adjusted to ensure the optimal amount of taxation without promoting the practice of tax evasion  As with any other crime  technological advancements have made the commission of tax evasion easier  faster and more globalized  The ability for organized criminals to operate fraudulent financial accounts  utilize illicit offshore bank accounts  access tax havens or tax shelters  and operating goods smuggling syndicates to evade importation taxes help ensure financial sustainability  security from law enforcement  general anonymity and the continuation of their operations   2 3  Cybercrime  2 3 1  Internet fraud  Identity theft is a form of fraud or cheating of another person s identity in which someone pretends to be someone else by assuming that person s identity  typically in order to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits in that person s name  Victims of identity theft  those whose identity has been assumed by the identity thief  can suffer adverse consequences if held accountable for the perpetrator s actions  as can organizations and individuals who are defrauded by the identity thief  and to that extent are also victims  Internet fraud refers to the actual use of Internet services to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims  to conduct fraudulent transactions  or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme  In the context of organized crime  both may serve as means through which other criminal activity may be successfully perpetrated or as the primary goal themselves  Email fraud  advance fee fraud  romance scams  employment scams  and other phishing scams are the most common and most widely used forms of identity theft  though with the advent of social networking fake websites  accounts and other fraudulent or deceitful activity has become commonplace   2 3 2  Copyright infringement  Copyright infringement is the unauthorized or prohibited use of works under copyright  infringing the copyright holder s exclusive rights  such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work  or to make derivative works  Whilst almost universally considered under civil procedure  the impact and intent of organized criminal operations in this area of crime has been the subject of much debate  Article 61 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPs  requires that signatory countries establish criminal procedures and penalties in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale  More recently copyright holders have demanded that states provide criminal sanctions for all types of copyright infringement  Organized criminal groups capitalize on consumer complicity  advancements in security and anonymity technology  emerging markets and new methods of product transmission  and the consistent nature of these provides a stable financial basis for other areas of organized crime   2 3 3  Cyberwarfare  Cyberwarfare refers to politically motivated hacking to conduct sabotage and espionage  It is a form of information warfare sometimes seen as analogous to conventional warfare although this analogy is controversial for both its accuracy and its political motivation  It has been defined as activities by a nation state to penetrate another nation s computers or networks with the intention of causing civil damage or disruption  Moreover it acts as the  fifth domain of warfare   and William J  Lynn  U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense  states that  as a doctrinal matter  the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare        which  has become just as critical to military operations as land  sea  air  and space   Cyber espionage is the practice of obtaining confidential  sensitive  proprietary or classified information from individuals  competitors  groups  or governments using illegal exploitation methods on internet  networks  software and or computers  There is also a clear military  political  or economic motivation  Unsecured information may be intercepted and modified  making espionage possible internationally  The recently established Cyber Command is currently debating whether such activities as commercial espionage or theft of intellectual property are criminal activities or actual  breaches of national security   Furthermore  military activities that use computers and satellites for coordination are at risk of equipment disruption  Orders and communications can be intercepted or replaced  Power  water  fuel  communications  and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to sabotage  According to Clarke  the civilian realm is also at risk  noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers  and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid  trains  or the stock market   2 3 4  Computer viruses  The term  computer virus  may be used as an overarching phrase to include all types of true viruses  malware  including computer worms  Trojan horses  most rootkits  spyware  dishonest adware and other malicious and unwanted software  though all are technically unique   and proves to be quite financially lucrative for criminal organizations  offering greater opportunities for fraud and extortion whilst increasing security  secrecy and anonymity  Worms may be utilized by organized crime groups to exploit security vulnerabilities  duplicating itself automatically across other computers a given network   while a Trojan horse is a program that appears harmless but hides malicious functions  such as retrieval of stored confidential data  corruption of information  or interception of transmissions   Worms and Trojan horses  like viruses  may harm a computer system s data or performance  Applying the Internet model of organized crime  the proliferation of computer viruses and other malicious software promotes a sense of detachment between the perpetrator  whether that be the criminal organization or another individual  and the victim  this may help to explain vast increases in cyber crime such as these for the purpose of ideological crime or terrorism  In mid July 2010  security experts discovered a malicious software program that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world  It is considered  the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies   notes the New York Times   2 4  White collar crime and corruption  2 4 1  Corporate crime  Corporate crime refers to crimes committed either by a corporation  i e   a business entity having a separate legal personality from the natural persons that manage its activities   or by individuals that may be identified with a corporation or other business entity  see vicarious liability and corporate liability   Note that some forms of corporate corruption may not actually be criminal if they are not specifically illegal under a given system of laws  For example  some jurisdictions allow insider trading   2 4 2  Labor Racketeering  Labor racketeering has developed since the 1930s  effecting national and international construction  mining  energy production and transportation sectors immensely  Activity has focused on the importation of cheap or unfree labor  involvement with union and public officials  political corruption   and counterfeiting   2 4 3  Political corruption  Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain  Misuse of government power for other purposes  such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality  is not considered political corruption  Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government  An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties  Forms of corruption vary  but include bribery  extortion  cronyism  nepotism  patronage  graft  and embezzlement  While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking  money laundering  and human trafficking  it is not restricted to these activities  The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction  For instance  certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another  In some cases  government officials have broad or poorly defined powers  which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions  Worldwide  bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually  A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy  literally meaning  rule by thieves    2 5  Drug trafficking  Heroin  Source countries   production  three major regions known as the Golden Triangle  Burma  Laos  Thailand   Golden Crescent  Afghanistan  and Central and South America  There are suggestions that due to the continuing decline in opium production in South East Asia  traffickers may begin to look to Afghanistan as a source of heroin    2 6  Human trafficking  2 6 1  Sex trafficking  Human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a major cause of contemporary sexual slavery and is primarily for prostituting women and children into sex industries  Sexual slavery encompasses most  if not all  forms of forced prostitution  The terms  forced prostitution  or  enforced prostitution  appear in international and humanitarian conventions but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied   Forced prostitution  generally refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity  Official numbers of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary  In 2001 International Organization for Migration estimated 400 000  the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated 700 000 and UNICEF estimated 1 75 million  The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand  Japan  Israel  Belgium  the Netherlands  Germany  Italy  Turkey and the United States  according to a report by UNODC   2 6 2  Illegal Immigration and People smuggling   Migrant Trafficking    See Snakehead  gang   Coyotaje  People smuggling is defined as  the facilitation  transportation  attempted transportation or illegal entry of a person or persons across an international border  in violation of one or more countries laws  either clandestinely or through deception  such as the use of fraudulent documents   The term is understood as and often used interchangeably with migrant smuggling  which is defined by the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime as     the procurement  in order to obtain  directly or indirectly  a financial or other material benefit  of the illegal entry of a person into a state party of which the person is not a national   This practice has increased over the past few decades and today now accounts for a significant portion of illegal immigration in countries around the world  People smuggling generally takes place with the consent of the person or persons being smuggled  and common reasons for individuals seeking to be smuggled include employment and economic opportunity  personal and or familial betterment  and escape from persecution or conflict   2 6 3  Contemporary slavery and forced labor  The number of slaves today remains as high as 12 million to 27 million  This is probably the smallest proportion of slaves to the rest of the world s population in history  Most are debt slaves  largely in South Asia  who are under debt bondage incurred by lenders  sometimes even for generations  It is the fastest growing criminal industry and is predicted to eventually outgrow drug trafficking   3  Historical origins  3 1  Pre Nineteenth Century  Today  crime is sometimes thought of as an urban phenomenon  but for most of human history it was the rural interfaces that encountered the majority of crime   Keep in mind  for most of human history  rural areas were the vast majority of inhabited places   For the most part  within a village  members kept crime at very low rates  however  outsiders such as pirates  highwaymen  and bandits attacked trade routes and roads  at times severely disrupting commerce  raising costs  insurance rates and prices to the consumer  According to criminologist Paul Lunde   Piracy and banditry were to the preindustrial world what organized crime is to modern society    As Lunde states   Barbarian conquerors  whether Vandals  Goths  Norsemen  Turks or Mongols are not normally thought of as organized crime groups  yet they share many features associated with thriving criminal organizations  They were for the most part non ideological  predominantly ethnically based  used violence and intimidation  and adhered to their own codes of law   Terrorism is linked to organized crime  but has political aims rather than solely financial ones  so there is overlap but separation between terrorism and organized crime   3 2  Twentieth century  Donald Cressey’s Cosa Nostra model studied Mafia families exclusively and this limits his broader findings  Structures are formal and rational with allocated tasks  limits on entrance  and influence the rules established for organizational maintenance and sustainability  In this context there is a difference between organized and professional crime  there is well defined hierarchy of roles for leaders and members  underlying rules and specific goals that determine their behavior  and these are formed as a social system  one that was rationally designed to maximize profits and to provide forbidden goods  Albini saw organized criminal behavior as consisting of networks of patrons and clients  rather than rational hierarchies or secret societies   The networks are characterized by a loose system of power relations  Each participant is interested in furthering his own welfare  Criminal entrepreneurs are the patrons and they exchange information with their clients in order to obtain their support  Clients include members of gangs  local and national politicians  government officials and people engaged in legitimate business  People in the network may not directly be part of the core criminal organization  Furthering the approach of both Cressey and Albini  Ianni and Ianni studied Italian American crime syndicates in New York and other cities   Kinship is seen as the basis of organized crime rather than the structures Cressey had identified  this includes fictive godparental and affinitive ties as well as those based on blood relations  and it is the impersonal actions  not the status or affiliations of their members  that define the group  Rules of conduct and behavioral aspects of power and networks and roles include the following   family operates as a social unit  with social and business functions merged   leadership positions down to middle management are kinship based   the higher the position  the closer the kinship relationship   group assigns leadership positions to a central group of family members  including fictive godparental relationship reinforcement   the leadership group are assigned to legal or illegal enterprises  but not both  and   transfer of money  from legal and illegal business  and back to illegal business is by individuals  not companies  Strong family ties are derived from the traditions of southern Italy  where family rather than the church or state is the basis of social order and morality   3 2 1  The “disorganized crime” and choice theses  One of the most important trends to emerge in criminological thinking about OC in recent years is the suggestion that it is not  in a formal sense  ‘organized’ at all  Evidence includes  lack of centralized control  absence of formal lines of communication  fragmented organizational structure  It is distinctively disorganized  For example  Seattle’s crime network in the 1970s and 80s consisted of groups of businessmen  politicians and of law enforcement officers  They all had links to a national network via Meyer Lansky  who was powerful  but there was no evidence that Lansky or anyone else exercised centralized control over them   While some crime involved well known criminal hierarchies in the city  criminal activity was not subject to central management by these hierarchies nor by other controlling groups  nor were activities limited to a finite number of objectives  The networks of criminals involved with the crimes did not exhibit organizational cohesion  Too much emphasis had been placed on the Mafia as controlling OC  The Mafia were certainly powerful but they “were part of a heterogeneous underworld  a network characterized by complex webs of relationships   OC groups were violent and aimed at making money but because of the lack of structure and fragmentation of objectives  they were ‘disorganized’   Further studies showed neither bureaucracy nor kinship groups are the primary structure of organized crime  rather they were in partnerships or a series of joint business ventures  Despite these conclusions  all researchers observed a degree of managerial activities among the groups they studied  All observed networks and a degree of persistence  and there may be utility in focusing on the identification of organizing roles of people and events rather than the group’s structure  There may be three main approaches to understand the organizations in terms of their roles as social systems   organizations as rational systems  Highly formalized structures in terms of bureaucracy’s and hierarchy  with formal systems of rules regarding authority and highly specific goals   organizations as natural systems  Participants may regard the organisation as an end in itself  not merely a means to some other end  Promoting group values to maintain solidarity is high on the agenda  They do not rely on profit maximization  Their perversity and violence in respect of relationships is often remarkable  but they are characterized by their focus on the connections between their members  their associates and their victims  and   organizations open systems  High levels of interdependence between themselves and the environment in which they operate  There is no one way in which they are organized or how they operate  They are adaptable and change to meet the demands of their changing environments and circumstances  Organized crime groups may be a combination of all three   3 2 2  International governance approach  International consensus on defining organized crime has become important since the 1970s due its increased prevalence and impact  e g  UN in 1976 and EU 1998  OC is “…the large scale and complex criminal activity carried on by groups of persons  however loosely or tightly organized for the enrichment of those participating at the expense of the community and its members  It is frequently accomplished through ruthless disregard of any law  including offenses against the person and frequently in connection with political corruption ”  UN  “A criminal organization shall mean a lasting  structured association of two or more persons  acting in concert with a view to committing crimes or other offenses which are punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order of a maximum of at least four years or a more serious penalty  whether such crimes or offenses are an end in themselves or a means of obtaining material benefits and  if necessary  of improperly influencing the operation of public authorities ”  UE  Not all groups exhibit the same characteristics of structure  However  violence and corruption and the pursuit of multiple enterprises and continuity serve to form the essence of OC activity   There are eleven characteristics from the European Commission and Europol pertinent to a working definition of organized crime  Six of those must be satisfied and the four in italics are mandatory  Summarized they are   more than two people   their own appointed tasks   activity over a prolonged or indefinite period of time   the use discipline or control   perpetration of serious criminal offenses   operations on an international or transnational level   the use violence or other intimidation   the use of commercial or businesslike structures   engagement in money laundering   exertion of influence on politics  media  public administration  judicial authorities or the economy  and   motivated by the pursuit of profit and or power  with the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  the Palermo Convention  having a similar definition   organized criminal  structured group  three or more people  one or more serious crimes  in order to obtain financial or other material benefit   serious crime  offense punishable by at least four years in prison  and   structured group  Not randomly formed but doesn’t need formal structure  Others stress the importance of power  profit and perpetuity  defining organized criminal behavior as   nonideological  i e  profit driven   hierarchical  few elites and many operatives   limited or exclusive membership  maintain secrecy and loyalty of members   perpetuating itself  Recruitment process and policy   willing to use illegal violence and bribery   specialized division of labor  to achieve organization goal   monopolistic  Market control to maximize profits  and   has explicit rules and regulations  Codes of honor  Definitions need to bring together its legal and social elements  OC has widespread social  political and economic effects  It uses violence and corruption to achieve its ends  “OC when group primarily focused on illegal profits systematically commit crimes that adversely affect society and are capable of successfully shielding their activities  in particular by being willing to use physical violence or eliminate individuals by way of corruption ”  It is a mistake in using the term ‘OC’ as though it denotes a clear and well defined phenomenon  The evidence regarding OC “shows a less well organized  very diversified landscape of organizing criminals…the economic activities of these organizing criminals can be better described from the viewpoint of ‘crime enterprises’ than from a conceptually unclear frameworks such as “OC’ ” Many of the definitions emphasize the ‘group nature’ of OC  the ‘organization’ of its members  its use of violence or corruption to achieve its goals  and its extra jurisdictional character… OC may appear in many forms at different times and in different places  Due to the variety of definitions  there is “evident danger” in asking “what is OC ” and expecting a simple answer   3 2 3  The locus of power and organized crime  Some espouse that all organized crime operates at an international level  though there is currently no international court capable of trying offenses resulting from such activities  the International Criminal Court’s remit extends only to dealing with people accused of offenses against humanity  e g  genocide   If a network operates primarily from one jurisdiction and carries out its illicit operations there and in some other jurisdictions it is ‘international   though it may be appropriate to use the term ‘transnational’ only to label the activities of a major crime group that is centered in no one jurisdiction but operating in many  The understanding of organized crime has therefore progressed to combined internationalization and an understanding of social conflict into one of power  control  efficiency risk and utility  all within the context of organizational theory  The accumulation of social  economic and political power have sustained themselves as a core concerns of all criminal organizations   social  criminal groups seek to develop social control in relation to particular communities   economic  seek to exert influence by means of corruption and by coercion of legitimate and illegitimate praxis  and   political  criminal groups use corruption and violence to attain power and status  Contemporary organized crime may be very different from traditional Mafia style  particularly in terms of the distribution and centralization of power  authority structures and the concept of  control  over one s territory and organization  There is a tendency away from centralization of power and reliance upon family ties towards a fragmentation of structures and informality of relationships in crime groups  Organized crime most typically flourishes when a central government and civil society is disorganized  weak  absent or untrusted   This may occur in a society facing periods of political  economic or social turmoil or transition  such as a change of government or a period of rapid economic development  particularly if the society lacks strong and established institutions and the rule of law  The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe that saw the downfall of the Communist Bloc created a breeding ground for criminal organizations   The newest growth sectors for organized crime are identity theft and online extortion  These activities are troubling because they discourage consumers from using the Internet for e commerce  E commerce was supposed to level the playing ground between small and large businesses  but the growth of online organized crime is leading to the opposite effect  large businesses are able to afford more bandwidth  to resist denial of service attacks  and superior security  Furthermore  organized crime using the Internet is much harder to trace down for the police  even though they increasingly deploy cybercops  since most police forces and law enforcement agencies operate within a local or national jurisdiction while the Internet makes it easier for criminal organizations to operate across such boundaries without detection   In the past criminal organizations have naturally limited themselves by their need to expand  putting them in competition with each other  This competition  often leading to violence  uses valuable resources such as manpower  either killed or sent to prison   equipment and finances  In the United States  the Irish Mob boss of the Winter Hill Gang  in the 1980s  turned informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   He used this position to eliminate competition and consolidate power within the city of Boston which led to the imprisonment of several senior organized crime figures including Gennaro Angiulo  underboss of the Patriarca crime family  Infighting sometimes occurs within an organization  such as the Castellamarese war of 1930–31 and the Boston Irish Mob Wars of the 1960s and 1970s   Today criminal organizations are increasingly working together  realizing that it is better to work in cooperation rather than in competition with each other  once again  consolidating power   This has led to the rise of global criminal organizations such as Mara Salvatrucha and the 18th Street gang  The American Mafia in the U S  have had links with organized crime groups in Italy such as the Camorra  the  Ndrangheta  Sacra Corona Unita  and Sicilian Mafia  The Cosa Nostra has also been known to work with the Irish Mob  John Gotti of the Gambino family and James Coonan of the Westies are known to have worked together  with the Westies operating as a contract hit man for the Gambino family after they helped Coonan come to power   the Japanese Yakuza and the Russian Mafia  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that organized crime groups held $322 billion in assets in 2005   This rise in cooperation between criminal organizations has meant that law enforcement agencies are increasingly having to work together  The FBI operates an organized crime section from its headquarters in Washington  D C  and is known to work with other national  e g

agencies   4  Theoretical background  4 1  Criminal psychology  4 1 1  Rational choice  This theory treats all individuals as rational operators  committing criminal acts after consideration of all associated risks  detection and punishment  compared with the rewards of crimes  personal  financial etc    Little emphasis is placed on the offenders’ emotional state  The role of criminal organizations in lowering the perceptions of risk and increasing the likelihood of personal benefit is prioritized by this approach  with the organizations structure  purpose  and activity being indicative of the rational choices made by criminals and their organizers   4 1 2  Deterrence  This theory sees criminal behavior as reflective of an individual  internal calculation by the criminal that the benefits associated with offending  whether financial or otherwise  outweigh the perceived risks  The perceived strength  importance or infallibility of the criminal organization is directly proportional to the types of crime committed  their intensity and arguably the level of community response  The benefits of participating in organized crime  higher financial rewards  greater socioeconomic control and influence  protection of the family or significant others  perceived freedoms from  oppressive  laws or norms  contribute greatly to the psychology behind highly organized group offending   4 1 3  Social learning  Criminals learn through associations with one another  The success of organized crime groups is therefore dependent upon the strength of their communication and the enforcement of their value systems  the recruitment and training processes employed to sustain  build or fill gaps in criminal operations  An understanding of this theory sees close associations between criminals  imitation of superiors  and understanding of value systems  processes and authority as the main drivers behind organized crime  Interpersonal relationships define the motivations the individual develops  with the effect of family or peer criminal activity being a strong predictor of inter generational offending  This theory also developed to include the strengths and weaknesses of reinforcement  which in the context of continuing criminal enterprises may be used to help understand propensities for certain crimes or victims  level of integration into the mainstream culture and likelihood of recidivism   success in rehabilitation   4 1 4  Enterprise  Under this theory  organized crime exists because legitimate markets leave many customers and potential customers unsatisfied  High demand for a particular good or service  e g  drugs  prostitution  arms  slaves   low levels of risk detection and high profits lead to a conducive environment for entrepreneurial criminal groups to enter the market and profit by supplying those goods and services  For success  there must be   an identified market  and   a certain rate of consumption  demand  to maintain profit and outweigh perceived risks  Under these conditions competition is discouraged  ensuring criminal monopolies sustain profits  Legal substitution of goods or services may  by increasing competition  force the dynamic of organized criminal operations to adjust  as will deterrence measures  reducing demand   and the restriction of resources  controlling the ability to supply or produce to supply    4 1 5  Differential association  Sutherland goes further to say that deviancy is contingent on conflicting groups within society  and that such groups struggle over the means to define what is criminal or deviant within society  Criminal organizations therefore gravitate around illegal avenues of production  profit making  protectionism or social control and attempt  by increasing their operations or membership  to make these acceptable  This also explains the propensity of criminal organizations to develop protection rackets  to coerce through the use of violence  aggression and threatening behavior  at times termed  terrorism    Preoccupation with methods of accumulating profit highlight the lack of legitimate means to achieve economic or social advantage  as does the organization of white collar crime or political corruption  though it is debatable whether these are based on wealth  power or both   The ability to effect social norms and practices through political and economic influence  and the enforcement or normaliszation of criminogenic needs  may be defined by differential association theory   4 2  Critical criminology and sociology  4 2 1  Social disorganization  Social disorganization theory is intended to be applied to neighborhood level street crime  thus the context of gang activity  loosely formed criminal associations or networks  socioeconomic demographic impacts  legitimate access to public resources  employment or education  and mobility give it relevance to organized crime  Where the upper  and lower classes live in close proximity this can result in feelings of anger  hostility  social injustice and frustration  Criminals experience poverty  and witness affluence they are deprived of and which is virtually impossible for them to attain through conventional means  The concept of neighborhood is central to this theory  as it defines the social learning  locus of control  cultural influences and access to social opportunity experienced by criminals and the groups they form  Fear of or lack of trust in mainstream authority may also be a key contributor to social disorganization  organized crime groups replicate such figures and thus ensure control over the counter culture  This theory has tended to view violent or anti social behavior by gangs as reflective of their social disorganization rather than as a product or tool of their organization   4 2 2  Anomie  Sociologist Robert K  Merton believed deviance depended on society’s definition of success  and the desires of individuals to achieve success through socially defined avenues  Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfill goals  therefore achieving success  by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled  Criminal organizations capitalize on states of normlessness by imposing criminogenic needs and illicit avenues to achieve them  This has been used as the basis for numerous meta theories of organized crime through its integration of social learning  cultural deviance  and criminogenic motivations  If crime is seen as a function of anomie  organized behavior produces stability  increases protection or security  and may be directly proportional to market forces as expressed by entrepreneurship  or risk based approaches  It is the inadequate supply of legitimate opportunities that constrains the ability for the individual to pursue valued societal goals and reduces the likelihood that using legitimate opportunities will enable them to satisfy such goals  due to their position in society    4 2 3  Cultural deviance  Criminals violate the law because they belong to a unique subculture   the counter culture   their values and norms conflicting with those of the working   middle  or upper classes upon which criminal laws are based  This subculture shares an alternative lifestyle  language and culture  and is generally typified by being tough  taking care of their own affairs and rejecting government authority  Role models include drug dealers  thieves and pimps  as they have achieved success and wealth not otherwise available through socially provided opportunities  It is through modeling organized crime as a counter cultural avenue to success that such organizations are sustained   4 2 4  Alien conspiracy queer ladder of mobility  The alien conspiracy theory and queer ladder of mobility theories state that ethnicity and  outsider  status  immigrants  or those not within the dominant ethnocentric groups  and their influences are thought to dictate the prevalence of organized crime in society  The alien theory posits that the contemporary structures of organized crime gained prominence during the 1860s in Sicily and that elements of the Sicilian population are responsible for the foundation of most European and North American organized crime  made up of Italian dominated crime families  Bell s theory of the  queer ladder of mobility  hypothesized that  ethnic succession   the attainment of power and control by one more marginalized ethnic group over other less marginalized groups  occurs by promoting the perpetration of criminal activities within a disenfranchised or oppressed demographic  Whilst early organized crime was dominated by the Sicilian Mafia they have been relatively substituted by the Irish Mob  early 1900s   the Aryan Brotherhood  1960s onwards   Colombian Medellin cartel and Cali cartel  mid 1970s   1990s   and more recently the Mexican Tijuana Cartel  late 1980s onwards   the Russian Mafia  1988 onwards   Al Qaeda  1988 onwards  and the Taliban  1994 onwards   Many argue this misinterprets and overstates the role of ethnicity in organized crime  A contradiction of this theory is that syndicates had developed long before large scale Sicilian immigration in 1860s  with these immigrants merely joining a widespread phenomena of crime and corruption   5  Legislative frameworks and policing measures   International
