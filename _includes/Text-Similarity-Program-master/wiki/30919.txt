Triage   or     is the process of determining the priority of patients  treatments based on the severity of their condition  This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately  The term comes from the French verb trier  meaning to separate  sift or select  Triage may result in determining the order and priority of emergency treatment  the order and priority of emergency transport  or the transport destination for the patient   Triage may also be used for patients arriving at the emergency department  or telephoning medical advice systems  among others  This article deals with the concept of triage as it occurs in medical emergencies  including the prehospital setting  disasters  and emergency room treatment   The term triage may have originated during the Napoleonic Wars from the work of Dominique Jean Larrey  The term was used further during World War I by French doctors treating the battlefield wounded at the aid stations behind the front  Those responsible for the removal of the wounded from a battlefield or their care afterwards would divide the victims into three categories   Those who are likely to live  regardless of what care they receive   Those who are likely to die  regardless of what care they receive   Those for whom immediate care might make a positive difference in outcome  For many emergency medical services  EMS  systems  a similar model may sometimes still be applied  In the earliest stages of an incident  such as when one or two paramedics exist to twenty or more patients  practicality demands that the above  more  primitive  model will be used  However once a full response has occurred and many hands are available  paramedics will usually use the model included in their service policy and standing orders   As medical technology has advanced  so has modern approaches to triage which are increasingly based on scientific models  The categorizations of the victims are frequently the result of triage scores based on specific physiological assessment findings  Some models  such as the START model may be algorithm based  As triage concepts become more sophisticated  triage guidance is also evolving into both software and hardware decision support products for use by caregivers in both hospitals and the field   1  Types  This section is for concepts in triage  See other sections for specific triage tools  methods  and systems  1 1  Simple triage  Simple triage is usually used in a scene of an accident or  mass casualty incident   MCI   in order to sort patients into those who need critical attention and immediate transport to the hospital and those with less serious injuries  This step can be started before transportation becomes available   Upon completion of the initial assessment by medical or paramedical personnel  each patient may be labelled which may identify the patient  display assessment findings  and identify the priority of the patient s need for medical treatment and transport from the emergency scene  At its most primitive  patients may be simply marked with coloured flagging tape or with marker pens  Pre printed cards for this purpose are known as a triage tag   1 1 1  Tags  A triage tag is a prefabricated label placed on each patient that serves to accomplish several objectives   identify the patient   bear record of assessment findings   identify the priority of the patient s need for medical treatment and transport from the emergency scene   track the patients  progress through the triage process   identify additional hazards such as contamination  Triage tags may take a variety of forms  Some countries use a nationally standardized triage tag  while in other countries commercially available triage tags are used  and these will vary by jurisdictional choice  The most commonly used commercial systems include the METTAG  the SMARTTAG  E T LIGHT tm and the CRUCIFORM systems  More advanced tagging systems incorporate special markers to indicate whether or not patients have been contaminated by hazardous materials  and also tear off strips for tracking the movement of patients through the process  Some of these tracking systems are beginning to incorporate the use of handheld computers  and in some cases  bar code scanners   1 2  Advanced triage  For classifications  see the specific section for that topic   In advanced triage  doctors and specially trained nurses may decide that some seriously injured people should not receive advanced care because they are unlikely to survive  It is used to divert scarce resources away from patients with little chance of survival in order to increase the chances of survival of others who are more likely to survive   The use of advanced triage may become necessary when medical professionals decide that the medical resources available are not sufficient to treat all the people who need help  The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care  or drugs or other limited resources  This has happened in disasters such as volcanic eruptions  mass shootings  earthquakes  thunderstorms  and rail accidents  In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because of the severity of their injuries  Others would live if given immediate medical care  but would die without it   In these extreme situations  any medical care given to people who will die anyway can be considered to be care withdrawn from others who might have survived  or perhaps suffered less severe disability from their injuries  had they been treated instead  It becomes the task of the disaster medical authorities to set aside some victims as hopeless  to avoid trying to save one life at the expense of several others   If immediate treatment is successful  the patient may improve  although this may be temporary  and this improvement may allow the patient to be categorized to a lower priority in the short term  Triage should be a continuous process and categories should be checked regularly to ensure that the priority remains correct  A trauma score is invariably taken when the victim first comes into hospital and subsequent trauma scores taken to see any changes in the victim s physiological parameters  If a record is maintained  the receiving hospital doctor can see a trauma score time series from the start of the incident  which may allow definitive treatment earlier   1 3  Continuous integrated triage  Continuous integrated triage is an approach to triage in mass casualty situations which is both efficient and sensitive to psychosocial and disaster behavioral health issues that affect the number of patients seeking care  surge   the manner in which a hospital or healthcare facility deals with that surge  surge capacity  and the overarching medical needs of the event   Continuous integrated triage combines three forms of triage with progressive specificity to most rapidly identify those patients in greatest need of care while balancing the needs of the individual patients against the available resources and the needs of other patients  Continuous integrated triage employs   Group  Global  Triage  i e   M A S S  triage   Physiologic  Individual  Triage  i e   S T A R T    Hospital Triage  i e   E S I  or Emergency Severity Index  However any Group  Individual and or Hospital Triage system can be used at the appropriate level of evaluation   1 4  Reverse triage  Usually  triage refers to prioritising admission  A similar process can be applied to discharging patients early when the medical system is stressed  This process has been called  reverse triage   During a  surge  in demand  such as immediately after a natural disaster  many hospital beds will be occupied by regular non critical patients  In order to accommodate a greater number of the new critical patients  the existing patients may be triaged  and those who will not need immediate care can be discharged until the surge has dissipated  for example through the establishment of temporary medical facilities in the region   1 5  Undertriage and overtriage  Undertriage is the underestimating the severity of an illness or injury  An example of this would be categorizing a Priority 1  Immediate  patient as a Priority 2  Delayed  or Priority 3  Minimal   Historically  acceptable undertriage rates have been deemed 5% or less   Overtriage is the overestimating of the severity of an illness or injury  An example of this would be categorizing a Priority 3  Minimal  patient as a Priority 2  Delayed  or Priority 1  Immediate   Acceptable overtriage rates have been typically up to 50% in an effort to avoid undertriage  Some studies suggest that overtriage is less likely to occur when triaging is performed by hospital medical teams  rather than paramedics or EMTs   2  Outcomes  This section is for general concepts in triage based treatment options and outcomes  For specific triage systems and methods see the sections dedicated to that topic  2 1  Palliative care  For those patients that have a poor prognosis and are expected to die regardless of the medical treatment available  palliative care such as painkillers may be given to ease suffering before they die   2 2  Evacuation  In the field  triage sets priorities for evacuation or relocation to other care facilities   2 3  Alternative care facilities  Alternative care facilities are places that are set up for the care of large numbers of patients  or are places that could be so set up  Examples include schools  sports stadiums  and large camps that can be prepared and used for the care  feeding  and holding of large numbers of victims of a mass casualty or other type of event  Such improvised facilities are generally developed in cooperation with the local hospital  which sees them as a strategy for creating surge capacity  While hospitals remain the preferred destination for all patients  during a mass casualty event such improvised facilities may be required in order to divert low acuity patients away from hospitals in order to prevent the hospitals becoming overwhelmed   2 4  Secondary  in hospital  triage  In advanced triage systems  secondary triage is typically implemented by emergency nurses  skilled paramedics  or battlefield medical personnel within the emergency departments of hospitals during disasters  injured people are sorted into five categories   Some crippling injuries  even if not life threatening  may be elevated in priority based on the available capabilities  During peacetime  most amputation injuries may be triaged  Red  because surgical reattachment must take place within minutes  even though in all probability the person will not die without a thumb or hand   3  Specific systems  This section is for examples of specific triage systems and methods  For general triage concepts see the sections for types of triage  treatment options  and outcomes   3 1  Practical applied triage  During the early stages of an incident  first responders may be overwhelmed by the scope of patients and injuries  One valuable technique is the Patient Assist Method  PAM   The responders quickly establish a casualty collection point  CCP  and advise  either by yelling  or over a loudspeaker  that  anyone requiring assistance should move to the selected area  CCP    This does several things at once  it identifies patients that are not so severely injured  that they need immediate help  it physically clears the scene  and provides possible assistants to the responders  As those who can move  do so  the responders then ask   anyone who still needs assistance  yell out or raise your hands   this further identifies patients who are responsive  yet maybe unable to move  Now the responders can rapidly assess the remaining patients who are either expectant  or are in need of immediate aid  From that point the first responder is quickly able to identify those in need of immediate attention  while not being distracted or overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation  Using this method assumes the ability to hear  Deaf  partially deaf or victims of a large blast injury may not be able to hear these instructions   3 2  Scoring systems  Examples of scoring systems used   In Western Europe the Triage Revised Trauma Score  TRTS  is sometimes used and integrated into triage cards   The Injury Severity Score  ISS  is another example of a trauma scoring system  This assigns a score from 0 to 75 based on severity of injury to the human body divided into three categories  A  face neck head   B thorax abdomen   C extremities external skin   Each category is scored from 0 to 5 using the Abbreviated Injury Scale  from uninjured to critically injured  which is then squared and summed to create the ISS  A score of 6  for  unsurvivable   can also be used for any of the three categories  and automatically sets the score to 75 regardless of other scores  Depending on the triage situation  this may indicate either that the patient is a first priority for care  or that he or she will not receive care owing to the need to conserve care for more likely survivors   3 3  S T A R T  model  S T A R T   Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment  is a simple triage system that can be performed by lightly trained lay and emergency personnel in emergencies  It is not intended to supersede or instruct medical personnel or techniques  It has been taught to California emergency workers for use in earthquakes  It was developed at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach  California for use by emergency services  It has been field proven in mass casualty incidents such as train wrecks and bus accidents  though it was developed for use by community emergency response teams  CERTs  and firefighters after earthquakes   Triage separates the injured into four groups   The expectant who are beyond help  The injured who can be helped by immediate transportation  The injured whose transport can be delayed  Those with minor injuries  who need help less urgently Triage also sets priorities for evacuation and transport as follows   Deceased are left where they fell  These people are not breathing and an effort to reposition their airway has been unsuccessful   Immediate or Priority 1  red  evacuation by MEDEVAC if available or ambulance as they need advanced medical care at once or within 1 hour  These people are in critical condition and would die without immediate assistance   Delayed or Priority 2  yellow  can have their medical evacuation delayed until all immediate persons have been transported  These people are in stable condition but require medical assistance   Minor or Priority 3  green  are not evacuated until all immediate and delayed persons have been evacuated  These will not need advanced medical care for at least several hours  Continue to re triage in case their condition worsens  These people are able to walk  and may only require bandages and antiseptic   3 4  Hospital systems  Within the hospital system  the first stage on arrival at the emergency room is assessment by the hospital triage nurse  This nurse will evaluate the patient s condition  as well as any changes  and will determine their priority for admission to the Emergency Room and also for treatment  Once emergency assessment and treatment are complete  the patient may need to be referred to the hospital s internal triage system   For a typical inpatient hospital triage system  a triage physician will either field requests for admission from the ER physician on patients needing admission or from physicians taking care of patients from other floors who can be transferred because they no longer need that level of care  i e  intensive care unit patient is stable for the medical floor   This helps keep patients moving through the hospital in an efficient and effective manner   This triage position is often done by a hospitalist  A major factor contributing to the triage decision is available hospital bed space  The triage hospitalist must determine  in conjunction with a hospital s  bed control  and admitting team  what beds are available for optimal utilization of resources in order to provide safe care to all patients  A typical surgical team will have their own system of triage for trauma and general surgery patients  This is also true for neurology and neurosurgical services  The overall goal of triage  in this system  is to both determine if a patient is appropriate for a given level of care and to ensure that hospital resources are utilized effectively   4  Conventional classifications  In an advanced triage process injured people are sorted into categories  Conventionally there are five classifications with corresponding colors and numbers although this may vary by region   Black   Expectant  They are so severely injured that they will die of their injuries  possibly in hours or days  large area burns  severe trauma  lethal radiation dose   or in life threatening medical crisis that they are unlikely to survive given the care available  cardiac arrest  septic shock  severe head or chest wounds   their treatment is usually palliative  such as being given painkillers  to reduce suffering   Red   Immediate  They require immediate surgery or other life saving intervention  and have first priority for surgical teams or transport to advanced facilities  they  cannot wait  but are likely to survive with immediate treatment   Yellow   Observation  Their condition is stable for the moment but requires watching by trained persons and frequent re triage  will need hospital care  and would receive immediate priority care under  normal  circumstances    Green   Wait  walking wounded   They will require a doctor s care in several hours or days but not immediately  may wait for a number of hours or be told to go home and come back the next day  broken bones without compound fractures  many soft tissue injuries    White   Dismiss  walking wounded   They have minor injuries  first aid and home care are sufficient  a doctor s care is not required  Injuries are along the lines of cuts and scrapes  or minor burns   4 1  Australia  The Australasian Triage Scale  abbreviated ATS and formally known as the National Triage Scale  is a triage system that is implemented in both Australia and New Zealand  The scale has been in use since 1994  The scale consists of 5 levels  with 1 being the most critical  resuscitation   and 5 being the least critical  nonurgent    4 2  Canada  In the mid 1980s  The Victoria General Hospital  in Halifax  Nova Scotia  Canada  introduced paramedic triage in its Emergency Department  Unlike all other centres in North America that employ physician and primarily nurse triage models  this hospital began the practice of employing Primary Care level paramedics to perform triage upon entry to the Emergency Department  In 1997  following the amalgamation of two of the city s largest hospitals  the Emergency Department at the Victoria General closed  The paramedic triage system was moved to the city s only remaining adult emergency department  located at the New Halifax Infirmary  In 2006  a triage protocol on whom to exclude from treatment during a flu pandemic was written by a team of critical care doctors at the behest of the Ontario government   For routine emergencies  many locales in Canada now employ the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale  CTAS  for all incoming patients  The system categorizes patients by both injury and physiological findings  and ranks them by severity from 1–5  1 being highest   The model is used by both paramedics and E R nurses  and also for pre arrival notifications in some cases  The model provides a common frame of reference for both nurses and paramedics  although the two groups do not always agree on scoring  It also provides a method  in some communities  for benchmarking the accuracy of pre triage of calls using AMPDS  What percentage of emergency calls have return priorities of CTAS 1 2 3  etc   and these findings are reported as part of a municipal performance benchmarking initiative in Ontario  Curiously enough the model is not currently used for mass casualty triage  and is replaced by the START protocol and METTAG triage tags   4 3  Finland  Triage at an accident scene is performed by a paramedic or an emergency physician  using the four level scale of  Can wait    Has to wait    Cannot wait   and  Lost    4 4  France  In France  the Prehospital triage in case of a disaster uses a four level scale   DCD  décédé  deceased   or urgence dépassée  beyond urgency   UA  urgence absolue  absolute urgency   UR  urgence relative  relative urgency   UMP  urgence médico psychologique  medical psychological urgency  or impliqué  implied  i e  lightly wounded or just psychologically shocked   This triage is performed by a physician called médecin trieur  sorting medic   This triage is usually performed at the field hospital  PMA–poste médical avancé  i e  forward medical post   The absolute urgencies are usually treated onsite  the PMA has an operating room  or evacuated to a hospital  The relative urgencies are just placed under watch  waiting for an evacuation  The involved are addressed to another structure called the CUMP–Cellule d urgence médico psychologique  medical psychological urgency cell   this is a resting zone  with food and possibly temporary lodging  and a psychologist to take care of the brief reactive psychosis and avoid post traumatic stress disorder   In the emergency room of a hospital  the triage is performed by a physician called MAO–médecin d accueil et d orientation  reception and orientation physician   and a nurse called IOA– infirmière d organisation et d accueil  organisation and reception nurse   Some hospitals and SAMU organisations now use the  Cruciform  card referred to elsewhere   France has also a Phone Triage system for Medical Emergencies Phone Demands in its Samu Medical Regulation Centers through the 15 medical free national hot line   Medical Doctor Regulator  decides what is to be the most efficient solution   Emergency Telemedecine or dispatch of an Ambulance  a General Practitioner or a Physician+ Nurse + Ambulance Man  Hospital based MICU  Mobile Intensive Care Unit    4 5  Germany  Preliminary assessment of injuries is usually done by the first ambulance crew on scene  with this role being assumed by the first Notarzt arriving at the scene  As a rule  there will be no cardiopulmonary resuscitation  so patients who do not breathe on their own or develop circulation after their airways are cleared  will be tagged  deceased   Also  not every major injury automatically qualifies for a red tag  A patient with a traumatic amputation of the forearm might just be tagged yellow  have the bleeding stopped  and then be sent to a hospital when possible  After the preliminary assessment  a more specific and definite triage will follow  as soon as patients are brought to a field treatment facility  There  they will be disrobed and fully examined by an emergency physician  This will take approximately 90 seconds per patient   The German triage system also uses four  sometimes five colour codes to denote the urgency of treatment  Typically  every ambulance is equipped with a folder or bag with coloured ribbons or triage tags  The urgency is denoted as follows   4 6  Hong Kong  In Hong Kong  triage in Accident & Emergency Departments is performed by experienced registered nurses  patients are divided into five triage categories  Critical  Emergency  Urgent  Semi urgent and Non urgent   4 7  Japan  In Japan  the triage system is mainly used by health professionals  The categories of triage  in corresponding color codes  are   Category I  Used for viable victims with potentially life threatening conditions   Category II  Used for victims with non life threatening injuries  but who urgently require treatment   Category III  Used for victims with minor injuries that do not require ambulance transport   Category 0  Used for victims who are dead  or whose injuries make survival unlikely   4 8  United Kingdom  In the UK  the commonly used triage system is the Smart Incident Command System  taught on the MIMMS  Major Incident Medical Management  and  Support  training program  The UK Armed Forces are also using this system on operations worldwide  This grades casualties from Priority 1  needs immediate treatment  to Priority 3  can wait for delayed treatment   There is an additional Priority 4  expectant  likely to die even with treatment  but the use of this category requires senior medical authority and it has never been enacted   In the UK and Europe  the triage process used is sometimes similar to that of the United States  see below   but the categories are different   Dead – patients who have a trauma score of 0 to 2 and are beyond help  Priority 1 – patients who have a trauma score of 3 to 10  RTS  and need immediate attention  Priority 2 – patients who have a trauma score of 10 or 11 and can wait for a short time before transport to definitive medical attention  Priority 3 – patients who have a trauma score of 12  maximum score  and can be delayed before transport from the scene  4 9  United States military  Triage in a non combat situation is conducted much the same as in civilian medicine  A battlefield situation  however  requires medics and corpsmen to rank casualties for precedence in MEDEVAC or CASEVAC  The casualties are then transported to a higher level of care  either a Forward Surgical Team or Combat Support Hospital and re triaged by a nurse or doctor  In a combat situation  the triage system is based solely on resources and ability to save the maximum number of lives within the means of the hospital supplies and personnel   The triage categories  with corresponding color codes   in precedence  are   Immediate  The casualty requires immediate medical attention and will not survive if not seen soon  Any compromise to the casualty s respiration  hemorrhage control  or shock control could be fatal   Delayed  The casualty requires medical attention within 6 hours  Injuries are potentially life threatening  but can wait until the Immediate casualties are stabilized and evacuated   Minimal   Walking wounded   the casualty requires medical attention when all higher priority patients have been evacuated  and may not require stabilization or monitoring   Expectant  The casualty is expected not to reach higher medical support alive without compromising the treatment of higher priority patients  Care should not be abandoned  spare any remaining time and resources after Immediate and Delayed patients have been treated  Afterwards  casualties are given an evacuation priority based on need   Urgent  evacuation is required within two hours to save life or limb   Priority  evacuation is necessary within four hours or the casualty will deteriorate to  Urgent    Routine  evacuate within 24 hours to complete treatment  In a  naval combat situation   the triage officer must weigh the tactical situation with supplies on hand and the realistic capacity of the medical personnel  This process can be ever changing  dependent upon the situation and must attempt to do the maximum good for the maximum number of casualties   Field assessments are made by two methods  primary survey  used to detect & treat life threatening injuries  and secondary survey  used to treat non life threatening injuries  with the following categories   Class I  Patients who require minor treatment and can return to duty in a short period of time   Class II  Patients whose injuries require immediate life sustaining measures   Class III  Patients for whom definitive treatment can be delayed without loss of life or limb   Class IV  Patients requiring such extensive care beyond medical personnel capability and time   5  Limitations of current practices  Notions of mass casualty triage as an efficient rationing process of determining priority based upon injury severity are not supported by research  evaluation and testing of current triage practices  which lack scientific and methodological bases  START and START like  START  triage that uses color coded categories to prioritize provide poor assessments of injury severity and then leave it to providers to subjectively order and allocate resources within flawed categories  Some of these limitations include   lacking the clear goal of maximizing the number of lives saved  as well as the focus  design and objective methodology to accomplish that goal  a protocol of taking the worst Immediate – lowest chances for survival – first can be statistically invalid and dangerous   using trauma measures that are problematic  e g   capillary refill  and grouping into broad color coded categories that are not in accordance with injury severities  medical evidence and needs  Categories do not differentiate among injury severities and survival probabilities  and are invalid based on categorical definitions and evacuation priorities  ordering  prioritization  and allocating resources subjectively within Immediate and Delayed categories  which are neither reproducible nor scalable  with little chance of being optimal  not considering addressing size of incident  resources  and injury severities and prioritization within its categories – e g   protocol does not change whether 3  30 or 3 000 casualties require its use  and regardless of available resources to be rationed  not considering differences in injury severities and survival probabilities between types of trauma  blunt versus penetrating  etc   and ages  resulting in inconsistent tagging and prioritizing ordering of casualties and substantial overtriage Research indicates there are wide ranges and overlaps of survival probabilities of the Immediate and Delayed categories  and other START limitations  The same physiologic measures can have markedly different survival probabilities for blunt and penetrating injuries  For example  a START Delayed  second priority  can have a survival probability of 63% for blunt trauma and a survival probability of 32% for penetrating trauma with the same physiological measures – both with expected rapid deterioration  while a START Immediate  first priority  can have survival probabilities that extend to above 95% with expected slow deterioration  Age categories exacerbate this  For example  a geriatric patient with a penetrating injury in the Delayed category can have an 8% survival probability  and a pediatric patient in the Immediate category can have a 98% survival probability  Issues with the other START categories have also been noted  In this context  color coded tagging accuracy metrics are not scientifically meaningful   Poor assessments  invalid categories  no objective methodology and tools for prioritizing casualties and allocating resources  and a protocol of worst first triage provide some challenges for emergency and disaster preparedness and response  These are clear obstacles for efficient triage and resource rationing  for maximizing savings of lives  for best practices and National Incident Management System  NIMS  compatibilities  and for effective response planning and training   Inefficient triage also provides challenges in containing health care costs and waste  Field triage is based upon the notion of up to 50% overtriage as being acceptable  There have been no cost benefit analyses of the costs and mitigation of triage inefficiencies embedded in the healthcare system  Such analyses are often required for healthcare grants funded by taxpayers  and represent normal engineering and management science practice  These inefficiencies relate to the following cost areas   tremendous investment in time and money since 9 11 to develop and improve responders  triage skills  cited benefits from standardization of triage methodology  reproducibility and interoperability  and NIMS compatibilities  avoided capital costs for taxpayer investment in additional EMS and trauma infrastructure  wasteful daily resource utilization and increased operating costs from acceptance of substantial levels of overtriage  prescribed values of a statistical life and estimated savings in human lives that could reasonably be expected using evidence based triage practices  ongoing performance improvements that could reasonably be expected from a more objective optimization based triage system and practices  6  Ethical implications  Because treatment is intentionally delayed or withheld from patients  advanced triage has ethical implications   Bioethical concerns have historically played an important role in triage decisions  such as the allocation of iron lungs during the polio epidemics of the 1940s and of dialysis machines during the 1960s  As many health care systems in the developed world continue to plan for an expected influenza pandemic  bioethical issues regarding the triage of patients and the rationing of care continue to evolve  Similar issues may occur for paramedics in the field in the earliest stages of mass casualty incidents when large numbers of potentially serious or critical patients may be combined with extremely limited staffing and treatment resources   Research continues into alternative care  and various centers propose medical decision support models for such situations  Some of these models are purely ethical in origin  while others attempt to use other forms of clinical classification of patient condition as a method of standardized triage   7  See also  Battlefield medicine  Combat stress reaction  Field triage  First aid  Hospital emergency codes  Mass
