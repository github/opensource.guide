A tort  in common law jurisdictions  is a civil wrong that unfairly causes someone else to suffer loss or harm resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act  called a tortfeasor  Although crimes may be torts  the cause of legal action is not necessarily a crime  as the harm may be due to negligence which does not amount to criminal negligence  The victim of the harm can recover their loss as damages in a lawsuit  In order to prevail  the plaintiff in the lawsuit must show that the actions or lack of action was the legally recognizable cause of the harm  The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is delict   Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries and may include emotional  economic  or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy  property  or constitutional rights  Torts comprise such varied topics as auto accidents  false imprisonment  defamation  product liability  copyright infringement  and environmental pollution  toxic torts   While many torts are the result of negligence  tort law also recognizes intentional torts  where a person has intentionally acted in a way that harms another  and in a few cases  particularly for product liability in the United States   strict liability  which allows recovery without the need to demonstrate negligence   Tort law is different from criminal law in that   1  torts may result from negligent but not intentional or criminal actions and  2  tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof such as preponderance of evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt  Sometimes a plaintiff may prevail in a tort case even if the person who caused the harm was acquitted in an earlier criminal trial  For example  O J  Simpson was acquitted in criminal court and later found liable for the tort of wrongful death   1  History  Roman law contained provisions for torts in the form of delict  which later influenced the civil law jurisdictions in Continental Europe  but a distinctive body of law arose in the common law world traced to English tort law  The word  tort  was first used in a legal context in the 1580s  although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time   1 1  Medieval period  Torts and crimes at common law originate in the Germanic system of compensatory fines for wrongs  OE unriht   with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs  In Anglo Saxon law  most wrongs required payment in money or in kind  bōt  literally ‘remedy’  to the wronged person or their clan  Wīte  literally  ‘blame  fault’  was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order  Weregild  which was a murder fine based on a victim s worth  was intended to prevent blood feuds  Some wrongs in later codes were botleas  e g   theft  open murder  arson  treason against one s lord   that is  unable to be compensated  and those convicted of a botleas crime were at the king s mercy  Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands  Assessing intention was a matter for the court  but Alfred s code did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones  whereas culpability depended on status  age  and gender   After the Norman Conquest  fines were paid only to courts or the king  and quickly became a revenue source  A wrong became known as a tort or trespass  and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown  The petty assizes  assize of novel disseisin  were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land  The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim  if no payment was made  the defendant was imprisoned  The plea arose in local courts for slander  breach of contract  or interference with land  goods  or persons  Although the details of its exact origin are unclear  it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made de cursu  available by right  not fee   however  it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king s peace  It may have arisen either out of the “appeal of felony”  or assize of novel disseisin  or replevin  Later  after the Statute of Westminster 1285  in the 1360s  the “trespass on the case” action arose for when the defendant did not direct force  As its scope increased  it became simply “action on the case”  The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case   In 1401  the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict liability for the escape of fire  additionally  strict liability was imposed for the release of cattle  Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources  Liability for common carrier  which arose around 1400  was also emphasized in the medieval period  Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period  As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries  however  collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records  In general  scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation  and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed  The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy   1 2  United States influence  The rights of victims to receive redress was regarded by later English scholars as one of the rights of Englishmen  Blackstone s Commentaries on the Laws of England  which was published in the late 18th century  contained a volume on  private wrongs  as torts and even used the word  tort  in a few places  The United States tort law was influenced by English law and Blackstone s treatise  with several state constitutions specifically providing for redress for torts in addition to reception statutes which adopted English law  However  tort law was viewed as relatively undeveloped by the mid 19th century  the first American treatise on torts was published in the 1860s but the subject became particularly established when Oliver Wendell Holmes  Jr wrote on the subject in the 1880s  Holmes  writings have been described as the  first serious attempt in the common law world to give torts both a coherent structure and a distinctive substantive domain   although Holmes  summary of the history of torts has been critically reviewed   1 3  Modern development  The law of torts for various jurisdictions has developed independently  In the case of the United States  a survey of trial lawyers pointed to several modern developments  including strict liability for products based on Greenman v  Yuba Power Products  the limitation of various immunities  e g  sovereign immunity  charitable immunity   comparative negligence  broader rules for admitting evidence  increased damages for emotional distress  and toxic torts and class action lawsuits  However  there has also been a reaction in terms of tort reform  which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions  and federal preemption of state laws   Modern torts are heavily affected by insurance and insurance law  as most cases are settled through claims adjustment rather than by trial  and are defended by insurance lawyers  with the insurance policy  a deep pocket limit  setting a ceiling on the possible payment   2  Comparative law  In the international comparison of modern tort law  common law jurisdictions based upon English tort law have foundational differences from civil law jurisdiction  which may be based on the Roman concept of delict  Even among common law countries  however  significant differences exist  For example  in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser  the English rule versus the American rule of attorney fees   Common law systems include United States tort law  Australian tort law  Canadian tort law  Irish tort law  and Scots Law of Delict  Israeli law of rabbinic damages is another example although tort law in Israeli law is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947  There is more apparent split between the Commonwealth countries  principally England and including Canada and Australia  and the United States  although Canada may be more influenced by the United States due to its proximity   The United States has been perceived as particularly prone to filing tort lawsuits even relative to other common law countries  although this perception has been criticized and debated  As of 1987  class actions were relatively uncommon outside of the United States  As of 1987  English law was less generous to the plaintiff in the following ways  contingent fee arrangements were restricted  English judges tried more decisions and set damages rather than juries  wrongful death lawsuits were relatively restricted  punitive damages were relatively unavailable  the collateral source rule was restricted  and strict liability  such as for product liability  was relatively unavailable  England s welfare state  such as free healthcare through National Health Service  may limit lawsuits  On the other hand  as of 1987 England had no workers compensation system and lawsuits due to workplace injuries were relatively common and facilitated by trade unions  whereas in the United States the system of workers compensation insurance prohibits lawsuits against the employer although lawsuits against third parties such as manufacturers does occur  The United States also has faced a rise in no fault insurance for automobile liability in several states  In England  ombudsmen may also take cases which could alternatively become tort lawsuits   When comparing Australia and the United States  Australia s tort law is similarly state law  however  there is a federal common law for torts unlike the United States  The influence of the United States on Australia has been limited  The United States may have influenced Australia s development of strict liability for products indirectly through legislation affected by European Union  and in the 1990s class actions were introduced in Australia  Australia has universal healthcare and  welfare state  systems which also limit lawsuits  In New Zealand  a no fault accident compensation system has limited the development of personal injury torts   3  Conflict of laws  In certain instances  different jurisdictions  law may apply to a tort  in which case rules have developed for which law to apply  This occurs particularly in the United States  where each of the 50 states may have different state laws  but also may occur in other countries with a federal system of states  or internationally   4  Categories  Torts may be categorized in several ways  with a particularly common division between negligent and intentional torts  Quasi torts may be used to refer to torts which are similar to but somewhat different from typical torts  Particularly in the United States   collateral tort  is used to refer to torts in labour law such as intentional infliction of emotional distress   outrage    or wrongful dismissal  these evolving causes of action are debated and overlap with contract law or other legal areas to some degree   The standard action in tort is negligence  The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages  or to relief  in each case designed to protect legal rights  including those of personal safety  property  and  in some cases  intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States  Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and personal injury accidents of many kinds  including clinical negligence  worker s negligence and so forth  Product liability cases  such as those involving warranties  may also be considered negligence actions or  particularly in the United States  may apply regardless of negligence or intention through strict liability   Intentional torts include  among others  certain torts arising from the occupation or use of land  The tort of nuisance  for example  involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another s enjoyment of his real property  Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person  or his structure  such as an overhanging building  on their land  Several intentional torts do not involve land  Examples include false imprisonment  the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone  and defamation  in some jurisdictions split into libel and slander   where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff s reputation   In some cases  the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes  For example  in some areas  workers  compensation laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment  In other cases  legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts  These are loosely grouped into quasi torts or liability torts   4 1  Negligence  Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the duty of care owed by one person to another from the perspective of a reasonable person  Although credited as appearing in the United States in Brown v  Kendall  the later Scottish case of Donoghue v Stevenson  1932   followed in England  brought England into line with the United States and established the  tort of negligence  as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions  In Donoghue  Mrs  Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill  She could not sue Mr  Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence  The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence  The elements in determining the liability for negligence are   The plaintiff was owed a duty of care through a special relationship  e g  doctor patient  or some other principle  There was a dereliction or breach of that duty  The tortfeasor directly caused the injury  but for the defendant s actions  the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury    The plaintiff suffered damage as a result of that breach  The damage was not too remote  there was proximate cause to show the breach caused the damage In certain cases  negligence can be assumed under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur  Latin for  the thing itself speaks    particularly in the United States  a related concept is negligence per se   4 1 1  Proximate cause  Proximate cause means that you must be able to show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for  The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a superseding intervening cause  A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident  where the person re injures an old injury  For example someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident  Years later he is still in pain  He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident  and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back  A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury  For example  if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further  the defense can argue that it was not the accident  but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury   4 2  Intentional torts  Intentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual  and that do so  Intentional torts have several subcategories   Torts against the person include assault  battery  false imprisonment  intentional infliction of emotional distress  and fraud  although the latter is also an economic tort   Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant  plaintiff   Those commonly recognized include trespass to land  trespass to chattels  personal property   and conversion  An intentional tort requires an overt act  some form of intent  and causation  In most cases  transferred intent  which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual  will satisfy the intent requirement  Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm   4 3  Statutory torts  A statutory tort is like any other  in that it imposes duties on private or public parties  however they are created by the legislature  not the courts  For example  the European Union s Product Liability Directive imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people  such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory   As another example  in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the Occupiers  Liability Act 1957  a similar situation occurred in the U S  State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in Rowland v  Christian was amended through a 1985 statute  Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food  In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions  which is particularly discussed in terms of the U S  FDA Preemption  although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to Riegel v  Medtronic  Inc   2008   actions for medical drugs are not due to Wyeth v  Levine  2009    4 4  Nuisance   Nuisance” is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap  Nuisances either affect private individuals  private nuisance  or the general public  public nuisance   The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land  In English law  whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was  for the benefit of the commonwealth   with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet  The case Jones v Powell  1629  provides an early example  in which a person s professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery  Although the outcome of this case is unclear  Whitelocke of the Court of the King s Bench is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated  the nuisance was not actionable as it is  better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor    In Rylands v  Fletcher  1868   strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard  including water  fire  or animals as long as the cause was not remote  In Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc  1994    chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table  contaminating East Anglia s water reservoirs   4 5  Defamation  Defamation is tarnishing the reputation of someone  it has two varieties  slander and libel  Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation  The two otherwise share the same features  making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist  Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions  but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States  or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights  Related to defamation in the U S  are the actions for misappropriation of publicity  invasion of privacy  and disclosure  Abuse of process and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well   4 6  Business torts  Business or economic torts typically involve commercial transactions  and include tortious interference with trade or contract  fraud  injurious falsehood  and negligent misrepresentation  Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no privity of contract  these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less commonly recoverable in tort  One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the  foreseeability  doctrine  The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied  In 2010  the supreme court of the U S  state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an  independent duty doctrine    Economic antitrust torts has been somewhat been submerged by modern competition law  However  in the United States  private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices  including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law tortious interference  which may be based upon the Restatement  Second  of Torts §766  Federal laws include the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 followed by the Clayton Antitrust Act which restrict cartels and through Federal Trade Commission regulate mergers and acquisitions  In the European Union  articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply but allowing private actions to enforce antitrust laws is under discussion   Negligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual privity exists was disallowed in England by Derry v Peek  1889   however  this position was overturned in Hedley Byrne v Heller in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a  special relationship  existed between the plaintiff and defendant  United States courts and scholars  paid lip service  to Derry  however  scholars such as William Prosser argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts  The case of Ultramares Corporation v  Touche  1932  limited the liability of an auditor to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s  The Restatement  Second  of Torts expanded liability to  foreseeable  users rather than specifically identified  foreseen  users of the information  dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants  architects  attorneys  and surveyors  As of 1989  most U S  jurisdictions follow either the Ultramares approach or the Restatement approach   The tort of deceit for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law  but in practice has been replaced by actions under Misrepresentation Act 1967  In the United States  similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule  Historically  and to some degree today   fraudulent  but not negligent  misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the  benefit of the bargain  rule  damages identical to expectation damages in contracts  which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value  Beginning with Stiles v  White  1846  in Massachusetts  this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the  out of pocket damages  rule as a minority rule  Although the damages under the  benefit of the bargain  are described as compensatory  the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction  The economic loss rule which emerged in the 20th century would eliminate these losses if applied strictly  which has led to preclusion of the tort or an exception to allow the tort if not related to a contract   5  Liability  defenses  and remedies  Indirect liability may arise due to some involvement  notably through joint and several liability doctrines as well as forms of secondary liability  Liability may arise through enterprise liability  Other concepts include market share liability   5 1  Vicarious liability  In certain cases  a person might be liable for their employee or child under the law of agency through the doctrine of respondeat superior  For example  if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries  the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer  There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant  or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation   5 2  Defenses  A successful defense absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages  Apart from proof that there was no breach of duty  there are three principal defenses to tortious liability   5 2 1  Consent and warning  Typically  a victim cannot hold another liable if the victim has implicitly or explicitly consented to engage in a risky activity  This is frequently summarized by the maxim  volenti non fit injuria   Latin   to a willing person  no injury is done  or  no injury is done to a person who consents    In many cases  those engaging in risky activities will be asked to sign a waiver releasing another party from liability   For example  spectators to certain sports are assumed to accept a risk of injury  such as a hockey puck or baseball striking a member of the audience  Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances  This issue arises  for example  in the duty of care that landowners have for guests or trespasses  known as occupiers  liability   5 2 2  Comparative or contributory negligence  If the victim has contributed to causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions  the damages may be reduced or eliminated entirely  The English case Butterfield v  Forrester  1809  established this defense  In England  this  contributory negligence  became a partial defense  but in the United States  any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages  This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault  the victim would lose the entire lawsuit  This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a comparative negligence system in many states  as of 2007 contributory negligence exists in only a few states such as North Carolina and Maryland   In comparative negligence  the victim s damages are reduced according to the degree of fault  Comparative negligence has been criticized as allowing a plaintiff who is recklessly 95% negligent to recover 5% of the damages from the defendant  Economists have further criticized comparative negligence as not encouraging precaution under the calculus of negligence  In response  many states now have a 50% rule where the plaintiff recovers nothing if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible   5 2 3  Illegality  If the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred  this may extinguish or reduce the defendant s liability  The legal maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio  Latin for  no right of action arises from a despicable cause   Thus  if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension  there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the property owner s intervention   5 2 4  Other defenses and immunities  Historically  immunity has been granted to governments under sovereign immunity and to charitable organizations under charitable immunity  although these have eroded in the United States   Various laws limit liability when giving aid to a person in need  liability can arise from a failure to help due to the duty to rescue   5 3  Remedies  The main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in  damages  or money  In a limited range of cases  tort law will tolerate self help  such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser  This is a defense against the tort of battery  Further  in the case of a continuing tort  or even where harm is merely threatened  the courts will sometimes grant an injunction  such as in the English case Miller v Jackson  1977   This means a command  for something other than money by the court  such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm  Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors  but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations  especially in relation to nuisance matters   6  Theory and reform  Scholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort  to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts  compensatory  aggravated  and punitive  British scholar Glanville Williams notes four possible bases on which different torts rested  appeasement  justice  deterrence and compensation   From the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers known as law and economics scholars emphasized incentives and deterrence  and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of risk  Ronald Coase  a principal proponent  argued in The Problem of Social Cost  1960  that the aim of tort should be to reflect as closely as possible liability where transaction costs should be minimized   Since the mid to late 20th century  calls for reform of tort law have come from various perspectives  Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants  For example  because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts  P  S  Atiyah has called the situation a  damages lottery   Consequently  in New Zealand  the government in the 1960s established a no fault system of state compensation for accidents  Similar proposals have been the subject of Command Papers in the UK and much academic debate   In the U S   reform has typically limited the scope of tort law and damages available  such as limiting joint and several liability  the collateral source rule  or capping noneconomic damages for emotional distress or punitive damages  These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the state constitutions by state supreme courts  with the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution possibly also relevant  Theoretical and policy considerations are central to fixing liability for pure economic loss and of public bodies   7  Relationship to contract law  Tort is sometimes viewed as the causes of action which are not defined in other areas such as contract or fiduciary law  However  tort and contract law are similar in that both involve a breach of duties  and in modern law these duties have blurred and it may not be clear whether an action  sounds in tort or contract   if both apply and different standards apply for each  such as a statute of limitations   courts will determine which is the  gravamen   the most applicable   Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence may involve both torts and contracts  The choice may affect time limits or damages  particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering may be awarded  Punitive damages are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases  However  compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions through the law of warranty   In the United Kingdom  plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies  in unusual cases  intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases   In the United States  the pure economic loss rule has been used to  mark the boundary  between tort and contract law cases and courts may consider a case which involves both causes to fall under only one area of law  This  economic loss rule  was adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc   1986  and has expanded across the country in a non uniform manner  leading to confusion  Among other examples  the tort of insurance bad faith arises out of a contractual relationship  and  collateral torts  such as wrongful dismissal involving possible overlap with labour law contracts   8  Overlap with criminal law  There is some overlap between criminal law and tort  For example  in English law an assault is both a crime and a tort  a form of trespass to the person   A tort allows a person  usually the victim  to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes  for example by the payment of damages to a person injured in a car accident  or the obtaining of injunctive relief to stop a person interfering with their business   Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a personalthough often criminal courts do have power to grant such remediesbut to remove their liberty on the state s behalf  This explains why incarceration is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes  but not usually for torts  In early common law  the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct   The more severe penalties available in criminal law also means that it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort  For example  in the O  J  Simpson murder trial  the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that O  J  Simpson had committed the crime of murder  but in a later civil trial  the jury in that case felt that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death   Many jurisdictions  especially the US  retain punitive elements in tort damages  for example in anti trust and consumer related torts  making tort blur the line with criminal acts  Also there are situations where  particularly if the defendant ignores the orders of the court  a plaintiff can obtain a punitive remedy against the defendant  including imprisonment  Some torts may have a public elementfor example  public nuisanceand sometimes actions in tort will be brought by a public body  Also  while criminal law is primarily punitive  many jurisdictions have developed forms of monetary compensation or restitution which criminal courts can directly order the defendant to pay to the victim   9  See also  Outline of tort law  Index of tort articles  Journal of Tort Law  10  Notes  11  Bibliography  Mark Lunney  Ken Oliphant  Tort Law   Texts  Cases  2003  2nd Ed  Oxford
