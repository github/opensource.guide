The Vehmic courts  Vehmgericht  holy vehme  or simply Vehm  also spelt Feme  Vehmegericht  Fehmgericht  are names given to a  proto vigilante  tribunal system of Westphalia in Germany active during the later Middle Ages  based on a fraternal organisation of lay judges called “free judges”   or    The original seat of the courts was in Dortmund  Proceedings were sometimes secret  leading to the alternative titles of “secret courts”     “silent courts”     or “forbidden courts”     After the execution of a death sentence  the corpse could be hung on a tree to advertise the fact and deter others   The peak of activity of these courts was during the 14th to 15th centuries  with lesser activity attested for the 13th and 16th centuries  and scattered evidence establishing their continued existence during the 17th and 18th centuries  They were finally abolished by order of Jérôme Bonaparte  king of Westphalia  in 1811   The Vehmic courts were the regional courts of Westphalia which  in turn  were based on the county courts of Franconia  They received their jurisdiction from the Holy Roman Emperor  from whom they also received the capacity to pronounce capital punishment    which they exercised in his name  Everywhere else the power of life and death  originally reserved to the Emperor alone  had been usurped by the territorial nobles  only in Westphalia  called “the Red Earth” because here the imperial Blutbann was still valid  were capital sentences passed and executed by the Fehmic courts in the Emperor s name alone   1  Etymology  The term s origin is uncertain  but seems to enter Middle High German from Middle Low German  The word vëme first appears in the Middle High German literature of the 13th century as a noun with the meaning of  punishment   A document dated to 1251 has the reference illud occultum judicium  quod vulgariter vehma seu vridinch appellari consuevit    It is hidden justice  that by common fashion is habitually referred to as vehma or vridinch     The general meaning of  punishment  is unrelated to the special courts of Westphalia which were thus originally just named  courts of punishment   But as the word entered the Southern German dialects via Saxony and Westphalia  the word s meaning in Early Modern German became attached to the activities of these courts specifically   Jacob Grimm thought that the word is identical in origin to a homophonous word for the raising of pigs on forest pastures  Hutewald   just as the more familiar German Zucht can mean both breeding and discipline  Grimm considers the spelling with h unetymological in spite of its early occurrence in some 13th century documents  and hypothesizes a  lost root   fëmen   connecting with Old Norse fimr and conjecturing a Gothic  fiman  fam  fêmun     During 18th to 19th century Romanticism  there were various misguided attempts to explain the obscure term  or to elevate it to the status of a remnant of pagan antiquity  scoffed at by Grimm s entry in his Deutsches Wörterbuch  A particularly fanciful etymology  suggested by James Skene in 1824  derives the word from Baumgericht  Lit   Tree law    supposedly the remnant of a pagan  forest law  of the Wild hunt and pagan secret societies   2  Origin  The Westphalian Vehmic courts developed from the High Medieval “free courts”     which had jurisdiction within a “free county”     As a result of the 14th century imperial reform of the Holy Roman Empire  Golden Bull of 1356   the Landgraviates lost much of their power  and the Freigerichte disappeared  with the exception of Westphalia  where they retained their authority and transformed into the Vehmic court   The seat of the Vehmic court    was at first Dortmund  in a square between two linden trees  one of which was known as the Femelinde  With the growing influence of Cologne during the 15th century  the seat was moved to Arnsberg in 1437   3  Membership and procedure  The sessions were often held in secret  whence the names of “secret court”     “silent court”     etc  Attendance of secret sessions was forbidden to the uninitiated  on pain of death  which led to the designation “forbidden courts”     A chairman    presided over the court  and lay judges    passed judgment  The court also constituted a Holy Order   Any free man  of pure bred German stock  and of good character could become a judge  The new candidate was given secret information and identification symbols  The “knowing one”    had to keep his knowledge secret  even from his closest family  “vor Weib und Kind  vor Sand und Wind”   Lay judges had to give formal warnings to known troublemakers  issue warrants  and take part in executions   The organization of the Fehme was elaborate  The centre of each jurisdiction was referred to as a “free seat”     and its head or chairman    was often a secular or spiritual prince  sometimes a civic community  the archbishop of Cologne being supreme over all     The actual president of the court was the “free count”    chosen for life by the Stuhlherr from among the Freischöffen  who formed the great body of the initiated  Of these the lowest rank were the Fronboten or Freifronen  charged with the maintenance of order in the courts and the duty of carrying out the commands of the Freigraf  The immense development of the Fehme is explained by the privileges of the Freischöffen  for they were subject to no jurisdiction but those of the Westphalian courts  whether as accused or accuser they had access to the secret sessions  and they shared in the discussions of the general chapter as to the policy of the society  At their initiation these swore to support the Fehme with all their powers  to guard its secrets  and to bring before its tribunal anything within its competence that they might discover  They were then initiated into the secret signs by which members recognized each other  and were presented with a rope and with a knife on which were engraved the mystic letters S S G G   supposed to mean Stein  Strick  Gras  grün  stone  rope  grass  green    The Freistuhl was the place of session  and was usually a hillock  or some other well known and accessible spot  The Freigraf and the Schöffen  judges  occupied the bench  before which a table  with a sword and rope upon it  was placed  The court was held by day and  unless the session was declared secret  all freemen  whether initiated or not  were admitted  The accusation was in the old German form  but only a Freischöffe could act as accuser  If the offence came under the competence of the court  meaning it was punishable by death  a summons to the accused was issued under the seal of the Freigraf  This was not usually served on him personally  but was nailed to his door  or to some convenient place where he was certain to pass  Six weeks and three days  grace were allowed  according to the old Saxon law  and the summons was thrice repeated  If the accused appeared  the accuser stated the case  and the investigation proceeded by the examination of witnesses as in an ordinary court of law  The judgment was put into execution on the spot if that was possible   The secret court  from whose procedure the whole institution has acquired its evil reputation  was closed to all but the initiated  although these were so numerous as to secure quasi publicity  any one not a member on being discovered was instantly put to death  and the members present were bound under the same penalty not to disclose what took place  Crimes of a serious nature  and especially those that were deemed unfit for ordinary judicial investigation  such as heresy and witchcraft  fell within its jurisdiction  as also did appeals by persons condemned in the open courts  and likewise the cases before those tribunals in which the accused had not appeared  The accused  if a member  could clear himself by his own oath  unless he had revealed the secrets of the Fehme  If he were one of the uninitiated it was necessary for him to bring forward witnesses to his innocence from among the initiated  whose number varied according to the number on the side of the accuser  but twenty one in favour of innocence necessarily secured an acquittal  The only punishment which the secret court could inflict was death  If the accused appeared  the sentence was carried into execution at once  if he did not appear  it was quickly made known to the whole body  and the Freischöffe who was the first to meet the condemned was bound to put him to death  This was usually done by hanging  the nearest tree serving for gallows  A knife with the mystic letters was left beside the corpse to show that the deed was not a murder   It has been claimed that  in some cases  the condemned would be set free  given several hours  head start and then hunted down and put to death  So fearsome was the reputation of the Fehme and its reach that many thus released committed suicide rather than prolonging the inevitable  This practice could have been a holdover from the ancient Germanic legal concept of outlawry  Acht    Legend and romance have combined to exaggerate the sinister reputation of the Fehmic courts  but modern historical research has largely discounted this  proving that they never employed torture  that their sittings were only sometimes secret  and that their meeting places were always well known   4  The spread of the Fehmic courts  The system  though ancient  came into wider use only after the division of the duchy of Saxony after the fall of Henry the Lion  when the archbishop of Cologne Engelbert II of Berg   also duke of Westphalia from 1180  placed himself at the head of the Fehme as representative of the emperor  The organization then spread rapidly  Every free man born in lawful wedlock and not excommunicated nor an outlaw was eligible for membership   Princes and nobles were initiated  and in 1429 even the Emperor Sigismund himself became “a true and proper Freischöffe of the Holy Roman Empire ” There is a manuscript in the Town Hall of the Westphalian town of Soest  which consists of an original Vehmic Court Regulation document  along with illustrations   By the middle of the 14th century these Freischöffen  Latin scabini   sworn associates of the Fehme  were scattered in thousands throughout the length and breadth of Germany  known to each other by secret signs and pass words  and all of them pledged to serve the summons of the secret courts and to execute their judgment   5  Decline and dissolution of the Courts  That an organization of this character should have outlived its usefulness and ushered in intolerable abuses  such as corruption was inevitable  from the mid fifteenth century protests were raised against the enormities of the court   With the growing power of the territorial sovereigns and the gradual improvement of the ordinary process of justice  the functions of the Fehmic courts were superseded  By the action of the Emperor Maximilian and of other German princes they were  in the 16th century  once more restricted to Westphalia  and here  too  they were brought under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts  and finally confined to mere police duties  With these functions  however  but with the old forms long since robbed of their impressiveness  they survived into the 19th century  They were finally abolished by order of Jérôme Bonaparte  king of Westphalia  in 1811  The last Freigraf died in 1835   6  Modern use of the term  Following the abandonment of the Vehmic courts  the term acquired a connotation of mob rule and lynching  In Modern German  the spelling of Feme is most common  Other variant forms are  Fehme  Feime  Veme  The verb verfemen is in current use and means  to ostracise   i e  by public opinion rather than formal legal proceeding  A noun derived from this is Verfemter  outlaw  ostracised person    In an 1856 lecture  philosopher Karl Marx used the Vehmic courts as a metaphor to describe his predictions of the working class revolution that would sweep Europe   Within the politically heated turmoil of the early German Weimar Republic after WWI  the media frequently used the term Fememord to refer to right wing political homicides  e g  the murder of Jewish politicians such as Kurt Eisner  1919   Matthias Erzberger  1921   or Walther Rathenau  1922  by right wing groups such as Organisation Consul  In 1926  the 27th Reichstag commission officially differed the contemporarily common Fememorde from political assassination in such that assassination was by definition exerted upon open political opponents  whereas a Fememord was a form of lethal vengeance committed upon former or current members of an organization that they had become a traitor of  This definition is also found in the common pseudo archaic  alliterating right wing phrase   Verräter verfallen der Feme     Traitors shall be ostracized    i  e  killed   as it was often quoted throughout the 1920s in mass media reports regarding violent acts of vengeance among the German Right   7  The Vehmic courts in fiction  Vehmic courts play a key role in the novel Anne of Geierstein or  The Maiden of the Mist by Sir Walter Scott in which Archibald von Hagenbach  the Duke of Burgundy s governor at Brisach  Switzerland   is condemned and executed by the Vehmgericht  Scott drew his inspiration from Goethe s play Goetz von Berlichingen which he had translated  incorrectly   In William Makepeace Thackeray s novel  Vanity Fair   Was Rebecca guilty or not   the Vehmgericht of the servants  hall had pronounced against her   A character in the Dorothy L  Sayers novel Murder Must Advertise appears at a fancy dress party as a member of the Vehmgericht  which allows him to wear a hooded costume to disguise his identity   In Fritz Lang s M  the locals criminals of an unnamed city  probably Berlin  capture a child murderer and hold a vigilante court   In The Illuminatus  Trilogy  the Vehmic courts are mentioned as being connected to Nazi Werwolf commandos as well as the Illuminati   In A Study in Scarlet  a Sherlock Holmes novel by Arthur Conan Doyle  a newspaper article mentions the Vehmgericht  stating that the features of a recent death are similar to the organization s killings   The Vehmgericht also appear as antagonists in The Strong Arm  an 1899 novel set in the Holy Roman Empire by British Canadian author Robert Barr   Geoff Taylor s 1966 novel  Court Of Honor  features the Fehme being revived by a German officer and Martin Bormann  a featured character in other semi historical novels with post war  Nazi underground  themes  in the dying days of the Third Reich   The Freischoeffen also provided the subject for Berlioz s unfinished opera Les francs juges  the overture to which provided the signature tune for  Face to Face   the well known early series of British television interviews  conducted by the Rt Hon John Freeman MBE   8  See also  Feme
