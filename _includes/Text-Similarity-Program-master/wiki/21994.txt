Whereas originally the term Navigation applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination  Navigation research deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general  It can be defined as  The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location   Franz  Mallot  2000   It concerns basically all moving agents  biological or artificial  autonomous or remote controlled   Franz and Mallot proposed a navigation hierarchy in Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30  2006    There are two basic methods for navigation   Egocentric navigation also known as Idiothetic navigation  Allocentric navigation also known as Allothetic navigation  1  Human navigation  In human navigation people visualize different routes in their minds to plan how to get from one place to another  The things which they rely on to plan these routes vary from person to person and are the basis of the differing navigational strategies   Some people use measures of distance and absolute directional terms  north  south  east  and west  in order to visualize the best pathway from point to point  The use of these more general  external cues as directions is considered part of an allocentric navigation strategy  Allocentric navigation is typically seen in males and is beneficial primarily in large and or unfamiliar environments  This likely has some basis in evolution when males would have to navigate through large and unfamiliar environments while hunting  The use of allocentric strategies when navigating primarily activates the hippocampus and parahippocampus in the brain  This navigation strategy relies more on a mental  spatial map than visible cues  giving it an advantage in unknown areas but a flexibility to be used in smaller environments as well  The fact that it is mainly males that favor this strategy is likely related to the generalization that males are better navigators than females as it is better able to be applied in a greater variety of settings   Egocentric navigation relies on more local landmarks and personal directions  left right  to navigate and visualize a pathway  This reliance on more local and well known stimuli for finding their way makes it difficult to apply in new locations  but is instead most effective in smaller  familiar environments  Evolutionarily  egocentric navigation likely comes from our ancestors who would forage for their food and need to be able to return to the same places daily to find edible plants  This foraging usually occurred in relatively nearby areas and was most commonly done by the females in hunter gatherer societies  Females  today  are typically better at knowing where various landmarks are and often rely on them when giving directions  Egocentric navigation causes high levels of activation in the right parietal lobe and prefrontal regions of the brain that are involved in visuospatial processing   2  Robotic navigation  Outdoor robots can use GPS in a similar way to automotive navigation systems  Alternative systems can be used with floor plan instead of maps for indoor robots  combined with localization wireless hardware   3  See also  Electric beacon  Visual navigation  4  Notes  5  References  Andreano  J  M   & Cahill  L   2009   Sex influences on the neurobiology of learning and memory  Learning & memory  16 4   248 246   Geary  D  C   1998   Male  female  The evolution of human sex differences   pp  259 303   Washington  DC  US  American Psychological Association
