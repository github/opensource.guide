A subject is a being who has a unique consciousness and unique experiences  or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside of itself  called an  object    A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed  This concept is especially important in continental philosophy  where  the Subject  is a central term in debates over human autonomy and the nature of the self   The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction  in the philosophy of René Descartes  between thought and extension  Descartes believed that thought  subjectivity  was the essence of the mind  and that extension  the occupation of space  was the essence of matter   In the modern continental tradition  which may plausibly be said to date from Descartes   debates over the nature of the Subject play a role comparable to debates over personhood within the distinct Anglo American tradition of analytical philosophy   In critical theory and psychology  subjectivity is also the actions or discourses that produce individuals or  I —the  I  is the subject   1  The subject in German idealism  Subject as a key term in thinking about human consciousness began its career with the German Idealists  in response to David Hume s radical skepticism  The idealists  starting point was Hume s conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big  fleeting bundle of perceptions  The next step was to ask how this undifferentiated bundle comes to be experienced as a unity – as a single subject  Hume had offered the following proposal   Kant  Hegel and their successors sought to flesh out the process by which the subject is constituted out of the flow of sense impressions  Hegel  for example  stated in his Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit that a subject is constituted by  the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself    Hegel begins his definition of the subject at a standpoint derived from Aristotelian physics   the unmoved which is also self moving   Preface  pgph  22   That is  what is not moved by an outside force  but which propels itself  has a prima facie case for subjectivity  Hegel s next step  however  is to identify this power to move  this unrest that is the subject  as pure negativity  Subjective self motion  for Hegel  comes not from any pure or simple kernel of authentic individuality  but rather  it is  The Hegelian subject s modus operandi is therefore cutting  splitting and introducing distinctions by injecting negation into the flow of sense perceptions  Subjectivity is thus a kind of structural effect – what happens when Nature is diffused  refracted around a field of negativity and the  unity of the subject  for Hegel  is in fact a second order effect  a  negation of negation   The subject experiences itself as a unity only by purposively negating the very diversity it itself had produced  The Hegelian subject may therefore be characterized either as  self restoring sameness  or else as  reflection in otherness within itself   ibid   In short  a subject in the Hegelian sense is subjected to subjection   2  Postmodern subjects  The thinking of Marx and Freud provided a point of departure for questioning the notion of a unitary  autonomous Subject  which for many thinkers in the Continental tradition is seen as the foundation of the liberal theory of the social contract  These thinkers opened up the way for the deconstruction of the subject as a core concept of metaphysics   Sigmund Freud s explorations of the unconscious mind added up to a wholesale indictment of Enlightenment notions of subjectivity   Among the most radical re thinkers of human self consciousness was Heidegger  whose concept of Dasein or  Being there  displaces traditional notions of the personal subject altogether   Jacques Lacan  inspired by Heidegger and Saussure  built on Freud s psychoanalytic model of the subject  in which the  split subject  is constituted by a double bind  alienated from jouissance when he or she leaves the Real  enters into the Imaginary  during the mirror stage   and separates from the Other when he or she comes into the realm of language  difference  and demand in the Symbolic or the Name of the Father   Thinkers such as Althusser  Foucault  or Bourdieu theorize the subject as a social construction  According to Althusser  the  subject  is an ideological construction  more exactly  constructed by the  Ideological State Apparatuses    One s subjectivity exists   always already  and is discovered through the process of interpellation  Ideology inaugurates one into being a subject  and every ideology is intended to maintain and glorify its idealized subject  as well as the metaphysical category of the subject itself   According to Foucault  it is the  effect  of power and  disciplines   See Discipline and Punish  construction of the subject as student  soldier   criminal   etc    Foucault believed it was possible to transform oneself  he used the word ethopoiein from the word ethos to describe the process   3  Subjectivity in analytic philosophy  In contemporary analytic philosophy  the issue of subject—and more specifically the  point of view  of the subject  or  subjectivity —has received attention as one of the major intractable problems in philosophy of mind  a related issue being the mind body problem   In the essay What is it like to be a bat   Thomas Nagel famously argued that explaining subjective experience—the  what it is like  to be something—is currently beyond the reach of scientific inquiry  because scientific understanding by definition requires an objective perspective  which  according to Nagel  is diametrically opposed to the subjective first person point of view  These additional features of subjective experience are often referred to as qualia  see Frank Cameron Jackson and Mary s room    4  See also  4 1  Philosophers  Rudolf Carnap  David Hume  C  L
