A navy  or maritime force  is a fleet of waterborne military vessels  watercraft  and its associated naval aviation  both sea based and land based  It is the branch of a nation s armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare  namely  lake borne  riverine  littoral  or ocean borne combat operations and related functions  It includes anything conducted by surface ships  amphibious ships  submarines  and seaborne aviation  as well as ancillary support  communications  training  and other fields  recent developments have included space related operations  The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country s shores  for example  to protect sea lanes  ferry troops  or attack other navies  ports  or shore installations   The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection of force by enemies  The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of nuclear missiles  Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications  brown water navy   open ocean applications  blue water navy   and something in between  green water navy   although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division   In most nations  the term  naval   as opposed to  navy   is interpreted as encompassing all maritime military forces  e g   navy  marine   marine corps  and coast guard forces   1  Etymology and senses  First attested in English in the early 14th century  the word  navy  came via Old French navie   fleet of ships   from the Latin navigium   a vessel  a ship  bark  boat   from navis   ship   The word  naval  came from Latin navalis   pertaining to ship   cf  Greek  naus    ship    nautes    seaman  sailor   The earliest attested form of the word is in the Mycenaean Greek compound word   na u do mo  *    shipbuilders   written in Linear B syllabic script  There is also a possible connection to the Sanskrit word Nava for boat ship   The word formerly denoted fleets of both commercial and military nature  In modern usage  navy  used alone always denotes a military fleet  although the term  merchant navy  for a commercial fleet still incorporates the non military word sense  This overlap in word senses between commercial and military fleets grew out of the inherently dual use nature of fleets  centuries ago  nationality was a trait that unified a fleet across both civilian and military uses  Although nationality of commercial vessels has little importance in peacetime trade other than for tax avoidance  it can have greater meaning during wartime  when supply chains become matters of patriotic attack and defense  and when in some cases private vessels are even temporarily converted to military vessels  The latter was especially important  and common  before 20th century military technology existed  when merely adding artillery and naval infantry to any sailing vessel could render it fully as martial as any military owned vessel  Such privateering has been rendered obsolete in blue water strategy since modern missile and aircraft systems grew to leapfrog over artillery and infantry in many respects  but privateering nevertheless remains potentially relevant in littoral warfare of a limited and asymmetric nature   2  History  Naval warfare developed when humans first fought from water borne vessels  Prior to the introduction of the cannon and ships with sufficient capacity to carry the large guns  navy warfare primarily involved ramming and boarding actions  In the time of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire  naval warfare centered on long  narrow vessels powered by banks of oarsmen  such as triremes and quinqueremes  designed to ram and sink enemy vessels or come alongside the enemy vessel so its occupants could be attacked hand to hand  Naval warfare continued in this vein through the Middle Ages until the cannon became commonplace and capable of being reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle  The Chola Dynasty of medieval India was known as a one of the greatest naval powers of its time from 300BC 1279AD  The Chola Navy  Chola kadarpadai comprised the naval forces of the Chola Empire along with several other Naval arms of the country  The Chola navy played a vital role in the expansion of the Chola Tamil kingdom  including the conquest of the Sri Lanka islands  Kadaaram  Present day Burma   Sri Vijaya  present day Southeast Asia   the spread of Hinduism  Tamil architecture and Tamil culture to Southeast Asia and in curbing the piracy in Southeast Asia in 900 CE  In ancient China  large naval battles were known since the Qin Dynasty  also see Battle of Red Cliffs  208   employing the war junk during the Han Dynasty  However  China s first official standing navy was not established until the Southern Song Dynasty in the 12th century  a time when gunpowder was a revolutionary new application to warfare   The mass and deck space required to carry a large number of cannon made oar based propulsion impossible and ships came to rely primarily on sails  Warships were designed to carry increasing numbers of cannon and naval tactics evolved to bring a ship s firepower to bear in a broadside  with ships of the line arranged in a line of battle   The development of large capacity  sail powered ships carrying cannon led to a rapid expansion of European navies  especially the Spanish and Portuguese navies which dominated in the 16th and early 17th centuries  and helped propel the age of exploration and colonialism  The repulsion of the Spanish Armada  1588  by the English fleet revolutionized naval warfare by the success of a guns only strategy and caused a major overhaul of the Spanish Navy  partly along English lines  which resulted in even greater dominance by the Spanish  From the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch cannibalized the Portuguese Empire in the East and  with the immense wealth gained  challenged Spanish hegemony at sea  From the 1620s  Dutch raiders seriously troubled Spanish shipping and  after a number of battles which went both ways  the Dutch Navy finally broke the long dominance of the Spanish Navy in the Battle of the Downs  1639    England emerged as a major naval power in the mid 17th century in the first Anglo Dutch war with a technical victory  Successive decisive Dutch victories in the second and third Anglo Dutch Wars confirmed the Dutch mastery of the seas during the Dutch Golden Age  financed by the expansion of the Dutch Empire  The French Navy won some important victories near the end of the 17th century but a focus upon land forces led to the French Navy s relative neglect  which allowed the Royal Navy to emerge with an ever growing advantage in size and quality  especially in tactics and experience  from 1695  Throughout the 18th century the Royal Navy gradually gained ascendancy over the French Navy  with victories in the War of Spanish Succession  1701–1714   inconclusive battles in the War of Austrian Succession  1740–1748   victories in the Seven Years  War  1754–1763   a partial reversal during the American War of Independence  1775–1783   and consolidation into uncontested supremacy during the 19th century from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805  These conflicts saw the development and refinement of tactics which came to be called the line of battle   The next stage in the evolution of naval warfare was the introduction of metal plating along the hull sides  The increased mass required steam powered engines  resulting in an arms race between armor and weapon thickness and firepower  The first armored vessels  the French Gloire and British HMS Warrior  made wooden vessels obsolete  Another significant improvement came with the invention of the rotating turrets  which allowed the guns to be aimed independently of ship movement  The battle between the CSS Virginia and the USS Monitor during the American Civil War  1861–1865  is often cited as the beginning of this age of maritime conflict  The Russian Navy was considered the third strongest in the world on the eve of the Russo Japanese War  which turned to be a catastrophe for the Russian military in general and the Russian Navy in particular  Although neither party lacked courage  the Russians were defeated by the Japanese in the Battle of Port Arthur  which was the first time in warfare that mines were used for offensive purposes  The warships of the Baltic Fleet sent to the Far East were lost in the Battle of Tsushima  A further step change in naval firepower occurred when the United Kingdom launched HMS Dreadnought  1906   but naval tactics still emphasized the line of battle   The first practical military submarines were developed in the late 19th century and by the end of World War I had proven to be a powerful arm of naval warfare  During World War II  Nazi Germany s submarine fleet of U boats almost starved the United Kingdom into submission and inflicted tremendous losses on U S  coastal shipping  The   a sister ship of the   was almost put out of action by miniature submarines known as X Craft  The X Craft severely damaged her and kept her in port for some months   A major paradigm shift in naval warfare occurred with the introduction of the aircraft carrier  First at Taranto in 1940 and then at Pearl Harbor in 1941  the carrier demonstrated its ability to strike decisively at enemy ships out of sight and range of surface vessels  The Battle of Leyte Gulf  1944  was arguably the largest naval battle in history  it was also the last battle in which battleships played a significant role  By the end of World War II  the carrier had become the dominant force of naval warfare   World War II also saw the United States become by far the largest Naval power in the world  In the late 20th and early 21st centuries  the United States Navy possessed over 70% of the world s total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1 000 tons or greater  Throughout the rest of the 20th century  the United States Navy would maintain a tonnage greater than that of the next 17 largest navies combined  During the Cold War  the Soviet Navy became a significant armed force  with large numbers of large  heavily armed ballistic missile submarines and extensive use of heavy  long ranged antisurface missiles to counter the numerous United States carrier battle groups  Only 3 nations  United States  France  and Brazil  presently operate CATOBAR carriers of any size  while Russia  China and India operate sizeable STOBAR carriers  although all three are originally of Russian design   The UK is also currently constructing two Queen Elizabeth class carriers  which will be the largest STOVL vessels in service  and India is currently building one Vikrant class aircraft carrier and considering another  France is also looking at a new carrier  probably using a CATOBAR system and possibly based on the British Queen Elizabeth design   3  Operations  A navy typically operates from one or more naval bases  The base is a port that is specialized in naval operations  and often includes housing  a munitions depot  docks for the vessels  and various repair facilities  During times of war temporary bases may be constructed in closer proximity to strategic locations  as it is advantageous in terms of patrols and station keeping  Nations with historically strong naval forces have found it advantageous to obtain basing rights in other countries in areas of strategic interest   Navy ships can operate independently or with a group  which may be a small squadron of comparable ships  or a larger naval fleet of various specialized ships  The commander of a fleet travels in the flagship  which is usually the most powerful vessel in the group  Prior to the invention of radio  commands from the flagship were communicated by means of flags  At night signal lamps could be used for a similar purpose  Later these were replaced by the radio transmitter  or the flashing light when radio silence was needed   A  blue water navy  is designed to operate far from the coastal waters of its home nation  These are ships capable of maintaining station for long periods of time in deep ocean  and will have a long logistical tail for their support  Many are also nuclear powered to save having to refuel  By contrast a  brown water navy  operates in the coastal periphery and along inland waterways  where larger ocean going naval vessels can not readily enter  Regional powers may maintain a  green water navy  as a means of localized force projection  Blue water fleets may require specialized vessels  such as mine sweepers  when operating in the littoral regions along the coast   4  Traditions  A basic tradition is that all ships commissioned in a navy are referred to as ships rather than vessels  with the exception of submarines  which are known as boats  The prefix on a ship s name indicates that it is a commissioned ship   An important tradition on board naval vessels of some nations has been the ship s bell  This was historically used to mark the passage of time  as warning devices in heavy fog  and for alarms and ceremonies   The ship s captain  and more senior officers are  piped  aboard the ship using a Boatswain s call   In the United States  the First Navy Jack is a flag that has the words   Don t Tread on Me  on the flag   By English tradition  ships have been referred to as a  she   However  it was long considered bad luck to permit women to sail on board naval vessels  To do so would invite a terrible storm that would wreck the ship  The only women that were welcomed on board were figureheads mounted on the prow of the ship   Firing a cannon salute partially disarms the ship  so firing a cannon for no combat reason showed respect and trust  As the tradition evolved  the number of cannon fired became an indication of the rank of the official being saluted   5  Naval organization  5 1  Ships  Historically  navy ships were primarily intended for warfare  They were designed to withstand damage and to inflict the same  but only carried munitions and supplies for the voyage  rather than merchant cargo   Often  other ships which were not built specifically for warfare  such as the galleon or the armed merchant ships in World War II  did carry armaments  In more recent times  navy ships have become more specialized and have included supply ships  troop transports  repair ships  oil tankers and other logistics support ships as well as combat ships  So long as they are commissioned  however  they are all  ships      Modern navy combat ships are generally divided into seven main categories  aircraft carriers  cruisers  destroyers  frigates  corvettes  submarines  and amphibious assault ships  There are also support and auxiliary ships  including the oiler  minesweeper  patrol boat  hydrographic and oceanographic survey ship and tender  During the age of sail  the ship categories were divided into the ship of the line  frigate  and sloop of war   Naval ship names are typically prefixed by an abbreviation indicating the national navy in which they serve  For a list of the prefixes used with ship names  HMS  USS  LÉ  etc   see ship prefix   Today ships are significantly faster than in former times  thanks to much improved propulsion systems  Also  the efficiency of the engines has improved  in terms of fuel  and of how many sailors it takes to operate them  In World War II  ships needed to refuel very often  However  today ships can go on very long journeys without refueling  Also  in World War II  the engine room needed about a dozen sailors to work the many engines  however  today  only about 4–5 are needed  depending on the class of the ship   Today  naval strike groups on longer missions are always followed by a range of support and replenishment ships supplying them with anything from fuel and munitions  to medical treatment and postal services  This allows strike groups and combat ships to remain at sea for several months at a time   5 2  Boats  The term  boat  refers to small craft limited in their use by size and usually not capable of making lengthy independent voyages at sea  The old navy adage to differentiate between ships and boats is that boats are capable of being carried by ships   Submarines by this rule are ships rather than boats  but are customarily referred to as boats reflecting their previous smaller size    Navies use many types of boat  ranging from dinghies to landing craft  They are powered by either diesels  out board gasoline engines  or waterjets  Most boats are built of aluminum  fiberglass  or steel  Rigid hulled inflatable boats are also used   Patrol boats are used for patrols of coastal areas  lakes and large rivers   Landing craft are designed to carry troops  vehicles  or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions  to unload  to withdraw from the beach  and to return to the ship  They are rugged  with powerful engines  and usually armed  There are many types in today s navies including hovercraft  They will typically have a power operated bow ramp  a cargo well and after structures that house engine rooms  pilot houses  and stowage compartments  These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships   Special operations craft are high speed craft used for insertion and extraction of special forces personnel and some may be transportable  and deployed  by air   Boats used in non combat roles include lifeboats  mail boats  line handling boats  buoy boats  aircraft rescue boats  torpedo retrievers  explosive ordnance disposal craft  utility boats  dive boats  targets  and work boats  Boats are also used for survey work  tending divers  and minesweeping operations  Boats for carrying cargo and personnel are sometimes known as launches  gigs  barges or shore party boats   5 3  Units  Naval forces are typically arranged into units based on the number of ships included  a single ship being the smallest operational unit  Ships may be combined into squadrons or flotillas  which may be formed into fleets  The largest unit size may be the whole Navy or Admiralty   A task force can be assembled using ships from different fleets for an operational task   5 4  Personnel  Despite their acceptance in many areas of naval service  women sailors were not permitted to serve on board U S  submarines until the U S  Navy lifted the ban in April 2010  The major reasons historically cited by the U S  Navy were the extended duty tours and close conditions which afford almost no privacy  The United Kingdom s Royal Navy has had similar restrictions  Australia  Canada  Norway  and Spain previously opened submarine service to women sailors   5 5  Ranks  A navy will typically have two sets of ranks  one for enlisted personnel and one for officers   Typical ranks for commissioned officers include the following  in ascending order  Commonwealth ranks are listed first on each line  USA ranks are listed second in those instances where they differ from Commonwealth ranks    Midshipman   Ensign   Corvette Lieutenant  Sub Lieutenant   Lieutenant Junior Grade   Frigate Lieutenant  Lieutenant  Commonwealth & USA   Ship of the Line Lieutenant   Captain Lieutenant  Lieutenant Commander  Commonwealth & USA   Corvette Captain  Commander  Commonwealth & USA   Frigate Captain  Captain  Commonwealth & USA   Ship of the Line Captain  Commodore   Flotilla Admiral  in USA only  Rear Admiral  lower half    Rear Admiral  in USA only  Rear Admiral  upper half    Vice Admiral  Commonwealth & USA   Admiral  Commonwealth & USA   Admiral of the Fleet  Commonwealth    Fleet Admiral  USA    Grand Admiral  Flag officers  include any rank that includes the word  admiral   or commodore in services other than the US Navy   and are generally in command of a battle group  strike group or similar flotilla of ships  rather than a single ship or aspect of a ship  However  commodores can also be temporary or honorary positions  For example  during World War II  a Navy captain was assigned duty as a convoy commodore  which meant that he was still a captain  but in charge of all the merchant vessels in the convoy   The most senior rank employed by a navy will tend to vary depending on the size of the navy and whether it is wartime or peacetime  for example  few people have ever held the rank of Fleet Admiral in the U S  Navy  the chief of the Royal Australian Navy holds the rank of Vice Admiral  and the chief of the Irish Naval Service holds the rank of Commodore   6  Naval infantry  During the era of the Roman empire  naval forces included marine legionaries for maritime boarding actions  These were troops primarily trained in land warfare  and did not need to be skilled at handling a ship  Much later during the age of sail  a component of marines served a similar role  being ship borne soldiers who were used either during boarding actions  as sharp shooters  or in raids along shorelines   The Spanish Infantería de Marina was formed in 1537  making it the oldest  current marine force in the world  The British  Royal Marines combine being both a ship based force and also being specially trained in commando style operations and tactics  operating in some cases separately from the rest of the Royal Navy  The Royal Marines also have their own special forces unit  The United States Marine Corps is a separate armed service within the United States Department of the Navy  with its own leadership structure   7  Naval aviation  In World War I several navies used floatplanes and flying boats   mainly for scouting  By World War II the aircraft carrier could carry bomber aircraft capable of attacking naval and land targets as well as fighter aircraft for defence  Since World War II helicopters have been embarked on smaller ships in roles such as anti submarine warfare  Some navies have also operated land based patrol aircraft   8  Additional reading  Non fiction   Combat Fleets of the World  Their Ships  Aircraft and Systems   Naval
