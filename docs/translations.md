## Starting a translation

Thanks for your interest in translating the guides! Before you start working on a translation, look through the [open translation issues](https://github.com/github/open-source-guide/labels/translation) to see if anyone else is already working on one for your language.

If there's not, then today is your day to lead this effort! Here's how to start:

0. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/github/open-source-guide/fork)
0. Open an issue using [this issue template](templates/translation-issue-template.md)
0. Start working through the checklist!

## Keeping a translation updated

TODO

should be easy to merge in changes from upstream without conflicts
