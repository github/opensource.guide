# Translations

Thanks for your interest in helping translating the guides!

## Starting a translation

Before you start working on a translation, look through the [open pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see if anyone else is already working on one for your language.

If there's not, then today is your day to lead this effort! Here's how to start:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/fork)
1. Create a new branch for your translation work e.g. `es`.
1. Copy `_data/locales/en.yml` to your target language file e.g. `_data/locales/es.yml` and translate all the strings.
1. Copy `index.html` to your target language index file e.g. `es.html` and update the `lang:`.
1. Create a new directory in `_articles/` for your language e.g. `_articles/es/`, copy each guide from `_articles/` into that folder and translate each guide.
1. Send a pull request.
