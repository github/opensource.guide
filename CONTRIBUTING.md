## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Open Source Guides are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests if you open a pull request. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created, as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, open a pull request.

## Style guide

If you're writing content, see the [style guide](./docs/styleguide.md) to help your prose match the rest of the guides.

## Setting up your environment

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Running it on your local machine requires a working [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installation with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) along with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have that set up:

1. Grant execution permissions to the scripts:

```bash
chmod +x script/bootstrap
chmod +x script/server
```

2. Execute the scripts:

```bash
./script/bootstrap
./script/server
```

â€¦and open <http://localhost:4000> in your web browser.

## Community
