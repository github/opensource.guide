In the early stages of your project, making major decisions is easy. When you want to do something, you just do it.

As your project becomes more popular, more people will take interest in the decisions you make. Even if you don't have a big community of contributors, if your project has a lot of users, you'll find people weighing in on decisions or raising issues of their own.

For the most part, if you've cultivated a friendly, respectful community and documented your processes openly, your community should be able to find a resolution. But sometimes you run into an issue that's a little bit harder to address. Here are some strategies to reach consensus.

## Set the bar for kindness

When your community is grappling with a difficult issue, tempers may rise. People may become angry or frustrated and take it out on one another, or on you.

Your job as a maintainer is to keep these situations from escalating. Even if you have a strong opinion on the topic, try to take the position of a moderator or facilitator, rather than jumping into the fight and pushing your views. If someone is being unkind or monopolizing the conversation, [act immediately](../../sustaining/healthy-communities/#dont-tolerate-bad-actors) to keep discussions civil and productive.

Other people are looking to you for guidance. Set a good example. You can still express disappointment, unhappiness, or concern, but do so calmly. Keeping your cool isn't easy, but demonstrating leadership improves the health of your community. The internet thanks you. 🙏

## Treat your README as a constitution

Your README is [more than just a set of instructions](../../getting-started/preparing/#writing-a-readme). It's also a place to talk about your goals, product vision, and roadmap. If people become overly focused on debating the merit of a particular feature, it may help to revisit your README and talk about the higher goals and vision of your project. Focusing on the README can also help depersonalize the conversation around a specific idea, so you can have a constructive discussion.

## Focus on the journey, not the destination

Some projects use a voting process to make major decisions. While sensible at first glance, voting emphasizes getting to an "answer," rather than listening to and addressing each other's concerns.

Voting can become political, where community members feel pressured to do each other favors or vote a certain way. Not everybody votes, either, whether it's the [silent majority](http://ben.balter.com/2016/03/08/optimizing-for-power-users-and-edge-cases/#the-silent-majority-of-users) in your community, or current users who didn't know a vote was taking place.

Sometimes, voting is a necessary tiebreaker. As much as you are able, however, emphasize "consensus seeking" rather than consensus. Under a consensus seeking process, community members discuss major concerns until they feel they have been adequately heard. When only minor concerns remain, the community moves forward. "Consensus seeking" acknowledges that a community may not be able to reach a perfect answer. Instead, it prioritizes listening and discussion.

Even if you don't actually adopt a consensus seeking process, as the maintainer of your project, it's important to make sure that people know you are listening. Making other people feel heard, and committing to resolving their concerns, can go a long way in diffusing a sensitive situation. Then, follow up on your words with actions.

Don't rush into a decision for the sake of having a resolution. Make sure that everybody feels heard and that all information has been made public before moving toward a resolution.

## Keep the conversation focused on action

While discussion is important, there is a difference between productive and unproductive conversations. Encourage discussion so long as it is actively moving towards resolution. If it's clear that conversation is languishing or going off-topic, jabs are getting personal, or people are quibbling about minor details, it's time to shut this thing down.

Allowing these conversations to continue is not only bad for the issue at hand, but bad for the health of your community. It sends a message that these types of conversations are permitted or even encouraged, and it can discourage people from raising or resolving future issues.

With every point made by you or by others, ask yourself, _"How does this bring us closer to a resolution?"_ If the conversation is starting to unravel, ask the group, _"Which steps should we take next?"_ to refocus the conversation.

If a conversation clearly isn't going anywhere, there are no clear actions to be taken, or the appropriate action has already been taken, close the issue and explain why it has been closed.

## Pick your battles wisely

Context is important. Consider who is involved in the discussion and how they represent the rest of the community. Is everybody in the community upset about, or even engaged with, this issue? Or is a lone troublemaker? Remember to consider your community members who are silent, not just the active voices.

A notable exception to this framing is when the issue concerns community behavior or governance. In this case, your community's health is at stake: not just current members, but people you may never hear from because they don't feel comfortable joining or participating. Healthy and welcoming communities help ensure a future for your project by encouraging active contribution. Unhealthy communities threaten the life of your project and will leave you feeling stressed and unhappy.

If the issue does not represent the broader needs of your community, you may just need to acknowledge the concerns of a few people. If this is a recurring issue without a clear resolution, point them to previous discussions on the topic and close the thread.

## Identify a community tiebreaker

With a good attitude and clear communication, most difficult situations are resolvable. However, even in a productive conversation, there can simply be a difference in opinion on how to proceed. In these cases, you should identify an individual or group of people that can serve as a tiebreaker. A tiebreaker could be the primary maintainer of the project, or it could be a small group of people who make a decision based on voting. Ideally, you've identified a tiebreaker and the associated process in your GOVERNANCE file before you ever have to use it.

Your tiebreaker should be a last resort. Divisive issues are an opportunity for your community to grow and learn. Embrace these opportunities and use a collaborative process to move to a resolution wherever possible.
