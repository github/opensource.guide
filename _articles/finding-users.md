title: Finding Users For Your Open Source Project
description: Help others find and use your project by telling them about your hard work.
---

You've just published an open source project. If you'd like others to find and use your project, then it's time to tell everybody about your hard work!

There's no rule that says you have to promote an open source project when you launch. There are many fulfilling reasons to work in open source that have nothing to do with popularity. If you don't want a lot of people to discover or use your project, then go on and keep being your awesome self.

## Figure out your message

Before you start the hard work of promoting your project, you should be able to explain what it does, and why it matters. What makes your project different or interesting? Why did you create it? Answering these questions for yourself will make it easier to convince others.

If you're hoping people will use and contribute to your project, remember that people get involved because it solves a problem for them. As you think about your project's message and value, try to view it through the lens of what _they_ might want.

Mozilla offers [some helpful exercises](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/personas_pathways/) for thinking about your community's user personas.

## Help people find and follow your project

> You ideally need a single "home" URL that you can promote and point people to in relation to your project. You don't need to splash out on a fancy template or even a domain name, but your project needs a focal point. - Peter Cooper & Robert Nyman, ["How to Spread the Word About Your Code"](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/how-to-spread-the-word-about-your-code/)

You can help people find and remember your project by pointing them to your project's namespace—a website, Twitter handle, or IRC channel, for example.

**Consider creating a website for your project.** [According to @adrianholovaty](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7531689), a website was _"by far the best thing we did with Django in the early days"_. A website makes your project friendlier and easier to navigate, especially paired with clear documentation and tutorials. It also suggests that your project is active, which will make your audience feel more comfortable using it. Use examples to give people ideas for how to use your project.

If your project is hosted on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to easily make a website. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) are [a few examples](https://github.com/showcases/github-pages-examples) of excellent, comprehensive websites.

**Have a clear handle to promote your work.** A Twitter handle, GitHub URL, or IRC channel is an easy way to point people to your project. They also give your project's growing community a place to convene. If you don't wish to set up these channels for your project yet, promote your own Twitter or GitHub handle in everything you do. For example, make sure it is included in your bio or slides if you speak at a meetup or event. That way, people know how to reach you or follow your work.

> A mistake I made in those early days was not starting a Twitter account for the project. Twitter's a great way to keep people up to date about a project as well as constantly expose people to the project. - @nathanmarz, ["History of Apache Storm and Lessons Learned"](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/history-of-apache-storm-and-lessons-learned.html)

Now that you have a message for your project, and easy ways for people to reach you, let's get out there and talk to your audience!

## Go where your project's audience is (online)

Take advantage of existing online communities and platforms to reach your audience. Online outreach is a great way to share and spread the word quickly, and you have the potential to reach a very wide audience.

> Each program has very specific functions that only a fraction of users will find useful. Don't spam as many people as possible. Instead, target your efforts to communities that will benefit from knowing about your project. - @pazdera, ["Marketing for open source projects"](http://radek.io/2015/09/28/marketing-for-open-source-projects-3/)

If your open source project is a software project, you can probably find your audience on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), or [Quora](https://www.quora.com/). Find the channels where you think people will most benefit from or be excited about your work. Some ideas for sharing your project include:

* **Ask for feedback.** Introduce yourself and your work to an audience that would find it relevant and interesting. Be specific about who you think would benefit from your project (try to finish the sentence: _"I think my project would really help X, who are trying to do Y_"). Listen and respond to others' feedback, rather than simply promoting your work. [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) is an example of a forum where you can share your project.
* **Find people experiencing the problem that your project solves.** Search through related forums for people who fall into your project's target audience. Answer their question and find a tactful way, if appropriate, to suggest your project as a solution.
* **Get to know related open source projects and communities.** Sometimes, you don't have to directly promote your project. If your project is perfect for data scientists who use Python, get to know the Python data science community. As people get to know you, natural opportunities will arise to talk about your work. Those people might promote your work to their audience through newsletters or forums, or you might be asked to write a blog post or speak at an event.

Generally speaking, focus on helping others before asking for things in return. Because it is easy for anybody to promote a project online, there will be a lot of noise. Give people context for who you are, not just what you want, to stand out from the crowd.

If nobody pays attention or responds to your initial outreach, don't get discouraged! Most project launches are an iterative process that can take months or years. If you don't get a response the first time, try a different tactic, or look for ways to add value to others' work first. These things take time and dedication.

## Go where your project's audience is (offline)

![public speaking](/assets/images/marketing/public_speaking.png)

Offline events are a popular strategy for promoting new projects. It's a great way to reach an engaged audience and build deeper human connections, especially if you are interested in reaching developers. @mitchellh [attributes](https://github.com/swinton/codeconf/blob/master/the-hashicorp-formula-to-open-source.md) [Vagrant](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant)'s growth and popularity to the talks he gave about the project.

If you're [new to public speaking](http://speaking.io/), start by finding a local meetup that's related to the language or ecosystem of your project. If you've never spoken at an event before, it's perfectly normal to feel nervous! Remember that your audience is there because they genuinely want to hear about your work. When you write your talk, remember to focus on what your audience will find interesting and get value out of. Keep your language friendly and approachable. Smile, breathe, and have fun.

> When you start writing your talk, no matter what your topic is, it can help if you see your talk as a story that you tell people. - Lena Reinhard, ["How to Prepare and Write a Tech Conference Talk"](http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2016/02/16/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-tech-conference-talk/)

When you feel ready, consider speaking at a conference to promote your project. Conferences can help you reach more people, sometimes from all over the world. Look for conferences that are specific to your language or ecosystem. Before you submit your talk, research the conference beforehand to tailor your talk to its attendees and increase your chances of getting accepted. You can often get a sense of a conference's audience by looking at its speakers.

@ry, author of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs), [was nervous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAc0vQCC6UQ&t=24m57s) about presenting his ideas for the first time at @JSConf:

> I wrote very nicely to the JSConf people and begged them to give me a slot where I could present it at JSConf EU....I was extremely scared, presenting this thing that I had been working on for six months....The whole time I was just thinking, oh my God. What am I doing here?

## Build a reputation

In addition to the strategies outlined above, the best way to invite people to share and contribute to your project is to share and contribute to their projects. Helping newcomers, sharing resources, and making thoughtful contributions to others' work will help you build a positive reputation. Then, people will have context for your work and be more likely to pay attention and share what you're doing.

Sometimes, these relationships can even lead to official partnerships with the wider ecosystem.

> "The only reason urllib3 is the most popular third-party Python library today is because it's part of requests." - @shazow, ["How to make your open source project thrive"](https://text.sourcegraph.com/how-to-make-your-open-source-project-thrive-with-andrey-petrov-6463b935c540#.mk31f8fgf)

It's never too early, or too late, to start! Even if you've launched your own project already, continue looking for find ways to be helpful to others. There is no magic formula to building an audience and reputation. Gaining the trust and respect of others takes time, and reputation building work never ends.

Spreading the word is an important step in growing the popularity of your project. It can be scary to share your creativity with the world, so give yourself a high five for making it this far.

Sometimes, it takes a long time before people notice your open source project. Your project will likely go through multiple phases of activity. That's okay! Some of the most popular projects today took years to reach high levels of activity. Be patient and keep spreading the word.
