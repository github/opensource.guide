# Preventing Burnout for Open Source Maintainers

Maintaining an open source project is rewarding but can be taxing. Burnout is a real challenge many maintainers face.

## Recognizing Burnout

Watch for these signs:

- Dreading to open GitHub notifications
- Irritability during contributor interactions
- Loss of enthusiasm for the project
- Difficulty separating work from personal time

## Setting Boundaries

- Define working hours and communicate them clearly
- Triage issues by priority
- Set realistic response time expectations
- Take regular breaks
- Automate repetitive tasks

## Building a Team

You don't have to do this alone:

- Identify potential co-maintainers
- Document your processes and decisions
- Mentor new maintainers
- Create clear contribution guidelines

## Taking Care of Yourself

- It's okay to say no to feature requests
- Celebrate milestones and wins
- Connect with other maintainers
- Seek professional support if needed
- Remember why you started the project

## Conclusion

Sustainable maintenance requires boundary-setting, delegation, and self-care. A healthy maintainer makes a healthy project.
