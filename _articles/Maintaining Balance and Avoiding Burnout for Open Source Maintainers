# Maintaining Balance for Open Source Maintainers

**Summary:**  
This guide provides tips for self-care and avoiding burnout as a maintainer, based on experiences from the Maintainer Community.

## Key Concepts

1. **Personal Ecology** – maintaining balance, pacing, and efficiency to sustain energy over time.  
2. **Burnout Signs** – chronic stress, loss of motivation, inability to focus, reduced empathy.  
3. **Motivation Awareness** – understanding what energizes you to prioritize your work effectively.

## Common Causes of Burnout

- **Lack of positive feedback** – Users often only report issues, not successes.  
- **Taking on too much** – Saying “yes” to every task leads to overwhelm.  
- **Working alone** – Isolation can increase stress.  
- **Insufficient time/resources** – Especially for volunteer maintainers.  
- **Conflicting demands** – Between personal goals, employers, or community expectations.

## Tips for Self-Care and Avoiding Burnout

### 1. Identify Your Motivations
Reflect on what energizes you in open source work. Examples:
- Positive feedback from users
- Collaborating with community
- Enjoyment of coding and problem-solving

### 2. Reflect on Stress Triggers
Track what makes you feel burned out, such as lack of feedback, overcommitment, isolation, or conflicting demands.

### 3. Watch for Signs of Burnout
Ask yourself:
- Can I maintain this pace for 10 weeks? 10 months? 10 years?  
- Use tools like the [Burnout Checklist](https://governingopen.com/resources/signs-of-burnout-checklist.html) or wearables to track stress and sleep.

### 4. Sustain Yourself and Your Community
- **Lean on the community** – delegate tasks, engage contributors, connect with peer groups like the [Maintainer Community](http://maintainers.github.com/).  
- **Explore funding** – GitHub Sponsors, accelerators, grants.  
- **Use tools** – GitHub Actions, Copilot for automating repetitive tasks.  
- **Rest and recharge** – hobbies, sleep, time off, and setting GitHub status.  
- **Set boundaries** – clearly communicate availability, priorities, and expectations.
