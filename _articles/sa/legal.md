## Understanding the legal implications of open source

Sharing your creative work with the world can be an exciting and rewarding experience. It can also mean a bunch of legal things you didn't know you had to worry about. Thankfully, with this guide you don't have to start from scratch. (Before you dig in, be sure to read our [disclaimer](/notices/).)

## Why do people care so much about the legal side of open source?

Glad you asked! When you make a creative work (such as writing, graphics, or code), that work is under exclusive copyright by default. That is, the law assumes that as the author of your work, you have a say in what others can do with it.

In general, that means nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.

Open source is an unusual circumstance, however, because the author expects that others will use, modify, and share the work. But because the legal default is still exclusive copyright, you need to explicitly give these permissions with a license.

These rules also apply when someone contributes to your project. Without a license or other agreement in place, any contributions are exclusively owned by their authors. That means nobody -- not even you -- can use, copy, distribute, or modify their contributions.

Finally, your project may have dependencies with license requirements that you weren't aware of. Your project's community, or your employer's policies, may also require your project to use specific open source licenses. We'll cover these situations below.

## Are public GitHub projects open source?

When you [create a new project](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) on GitHub, you have the option to make the repository **private** or **public**.

**Making your GitHub project public is not the same as licensing your project.** Public projects are covered by [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants), which allows others to view and fork your project, but your work otherwise comes with no permissions.

If you want others to use, distribute, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it's public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so.

## Just give me the TL;DR on what I need to protect my project.

You're in luck, because today, open source licenses are standardized and easy to use. You can copy-paste an existing license directly into your project.

[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/), and [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) are [popular open source licenses](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/licenses), but there are other options to choose from. You can find the full text of these licenses, and instructions on how to use them, on [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

When you create a new project on GitHub, you'll be [asked to add a license](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/).
