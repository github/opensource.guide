## Why some people seek financial support

Much of the work of open source is voluntary. For example, someone might come across a bug in a project they use and submit a quick fix, or they might enjoy tinkering with an open source project in their spare time.

I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. (...) I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately. (...) I chose Python as a working title.

There are many reasons why a person would not want to be paid for their open source work.

* **They may already have a full-time job that they love,** which enables them to contribute to open source in their spare time.
* **They enjoy thinking of open source as a hobby** or creative escape and don't want to feel financially obligated to work on their projects.
* **They get other benefits from contributing to open source,** such as building their reputation or portfolio, learning a new skill, or feeling closer to a community.

  Financial donations do add a feeling of responsibility, for some. (...) It's important for us, in the globally connected, fast-paced world we live in, to be able to say "not now, I feel like doing something completely different".

For others, especially when contributions are ongoing or require significant time, getting paid to contribute to open source is the only way they can participate, either because the project requires it, or for personal reasons.

Maintaining popular projects can be a significant responsibility, taking up 10 or 20 hours per week instead of a few hours per month.

  Ask any open source project maintainer, and they will tell you about the reality of the amount of work that goes into managing a project. You have clients. You are fixing issues for them. You are creating new features. This becomes a real demand on your time.
