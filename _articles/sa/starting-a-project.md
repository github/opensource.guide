## Why start a project?

Why would you start an open source project? Maybe you saw a problem that no existing project solved; maybe you want to scratch an itch; maybe you want to build something for your resume. Whatever the reason, starting a project is a rewarding way to learn and contribute.

## Pick a problem you care about

If you don't care about the problem, chances are others won't either. Pick something you find interesting and useful. The best projects solve problems that matter to their authors and users.

## Keep it small and focused

Starting with a small, well-scoped project increases your chance of success. Build a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterate from there. It's easier to attract users and contributors when your project solves a small, clear problem.

## Find collaborators

Open source projects benefit from having other people involved. Consider asking friends or colleagues to help you with the initial work. Early contributors can help with documentation, testing, and spreading the word about your project.

## Ship something people will use

Focus on delivering value. If your project helps people accomplish a task or solves a problem, users will appreciate it. Document your project clearly, provide examples, and make it easy to get started.

## Keep improving

Collect feedback, iterate, and be responsive to users. Being pragmatic and shipping regular improvements will help your project gain traction.
