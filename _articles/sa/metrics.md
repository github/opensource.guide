## Why measure anything?

Data, when used wisely, can help you make better decisions as an open source maintainer.

With more information, you can:

* Understand how users respond to a new feature
* Figure out where new users come from
* Identify, and decide whether to support, an outlier use case or functionality
* Quantify your project's popularity
* Understand how your project is used
* Raise money through sponsorships and grants

For example, [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/bbed7246bc5c5b7acb8c1d427d10b43e090dfd39/docs/Analytics.md) finds that Google Analytics helps them prioritize work:

> Homebrew is provided free of charge and run entirely by volunteers in their spare time. As a result, we do not have the resources to do detailed user studies of Homebrew users to decide on how best to design future features and prioritise current work. Anonymous aggregate user analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, where and when people use Homebrew.

Popularity isn't everything. Everybody gets into open source for different reasons. If your goal as an open source maintainer is to show off your work, be transparent about your code, or just have fun, metrics may not be important to you.

If you _are_ interested in understanding your project on a deeper level, read on for ways to analyze your project's activity.

## Discovery

Before anybody can use or contribute back to your project, they need to know it exists. Ask yourself: _are people finding this project?_

If your project is hosted on GitHub, [you can view](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/#traffic) how many people land on your project and where they come from. From your project's page, click "Insights", then "Traffic". On this page, you can see:
