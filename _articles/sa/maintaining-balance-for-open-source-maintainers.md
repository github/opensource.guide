As an open source project grows in popularity, it becomes important to set clear boundaries to help you maintain balance to stay refreshed and productive for the long run. 

To gain insights into the experiences of maintainers and their strategies for finding balance, we ran a workshop with 40 members of the <a href="http://maintainers.github.com/">Maintainer Community</a>, allowing us to learn from their firsthand experiences with burnout in open source and the practices that have helped them maintain balance in their work. This is where the concept of personal ecology comes into play.

So, what is personal ecology? As <a href="https://rockwoodleadership.org/nonprofit-four-day-workweek-can-take-care-still-change-world/#:~:text=personal%20ecology%3A%20maintaining%20balance%2C%20pacing%20and%20efficiency%20to%20sustain%20your%20energy%20over%20a%20lifetime%20of%20activism">described by the Rockwood Leadership Institute</a>, it involves "<strong>maintaining balance, pacing, and efficiency to sustain our energy over a lifetime</strong>." This framed our conversations, helping maintainers recognize their actions and contributions as parts of a larger ecosystem that evolves over time. Burnout, a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress as [defined by the WHO](https://icd.who.int/browse/2025-01/foundation/en#129180281), is not uncommon among maintainers. This often leads to a loss of motivation, an inability to focus, and a lack of empathy for the contributors and community you work with.

By embracing the concept of personal ecology, maintainers can proactively avoid burnout, prioritize self-care, and uphold a sense of balance to do their best work.

## Tips for Self-Care and Avoiding Burnout as a Maintainer:

### Identify your motivations for working in open source

Take time to reflect on what parts of open source maintenance energizes you. Understanding your motivations can help you prioritize the work in a way that keeps you engaged and ready for new challenges. Whether it's the positive feedback from users, the joy of collaborating and socializing with the community, or the satisfaction of diving into the code, recognizing your motivations can help guide your focus.

### Reflect on what causes you to get out of balance and stressed out

It's important to understand what causes us to get burned out. Here are a few common themes we saw among open source maintainers:

* **Lack of positive feedback:** Users are far more likely to reach out when they have a complaint. If everything works great, they tend to stay silent. It can be discouraging to see a growing list of issues without the positive feedback showing how your contributions are making a difference.
