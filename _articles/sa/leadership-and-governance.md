## Understanding governance for your growing project

Your project is growing, people are engaged, and you're committed to keeping this thing going. At this stage, you may be wondering how to incorporate regular project contributors into your workflow, whether it's giving someone commit access or resolving community debates. If you have questions, we've got answers.

## What are examples of formal roles used in open source projects?

Many projects follow a similar structure for contributor roles and recognition.

What these roles actually mean, though, is entirely up to you. Here are a few types of roles you may recognize:

* **Maintainer**
* **Contributor**
* **Committer**

**For some projects, "maintainers"** are the only people in a project with commit access. In other projects, they're simply the people who are listed in the README as maintainers.

A maintainer doesn't necessarily have to be someone who writes code for your project. It could be someone who's done a lot of work evangelizing your project, or written documentation that made the project more accessible to others. Regardless of what they do day-to-day, a maintainer is probably someone who feels responsibility over the direction of the project and is committed to improving it.

**A "contributor" could be anyone** who comments on an issue or pull request, people who add value to the project (whether it's triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events), or anybody with a merged pull request (perhaps the narrowest definition of a contributor).

  \[For Node.js,\] every person who shows up to comment on an issue or submit code is a member of a project’s community. Just being able to see them means that they have crossed the line from being a user to being a contributor.
