## Why some people seek financial support

Much of open source work is unpaid or volunteered. For example, someone might come across a bug in a project they use and submit a quick fix, or they might enjoy tinkering with an open source project in their spare time. (Did you know that @gvanrossum started [Python](https://github.com/python) over a Christmas holiday?)

There are plenty of reasons why a person or project would not want to be paid for open source work:

* They may already have a full-time job that they love, which enables them to contribute to open source in their spare time.
* They enjoy thinking of open source as a hobby or creative escape and don't want to feel financially obligated to work on their projects
* They get important social benefits from contributing to open source, such as building their reputation or portfolio, learning a new skill, or feeling closer to a community

> Financial donations do add a feeling of responsibility, for some. It's important for us, in the globally connected, fast-paced world we live in, to be able to say "not now, I feel like doing something completely different". - Eloy Durán, ["Why We Don't Accept Donations"](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Why-we-dont-accept-donations/)

For others, especially when contributions are ongoing or require significant time, getting paid to contribute to open source is the only way they can afford to do so. Maintaining popular projects can be a significant responsibility, taking up 10 or 20 hours per week instead of a few hours per month.

> Ask any open source project maintainer, and they will tell you about the reality of the amount of work that goes into managing a project. You have clients. You are fixing issues for them. You are creating new features. This becomes a real demand on your time. - Ashe Dryden, ["The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community"](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community)

Paid work also enables people from different walks of life to make meaningful contributions. Some people cannot afford to spend unpaid time on open source projects, based on their current financial position, debt, or family or other caretaking obligations. That means the world never sees contributions from talented people who can't afford to volunteer their time.

> OSS yields massive benefits to the technology industry, which, in turn, means benefits to all industries. However, if the only people who can focus on it are the lucky and the obsessed, then there's a huge untapped potential. - Issac Schlueter, ["Money and Open Source"](https://medium.com/open-source-life/money-and-open-source-d44a1953749c#.ftnd5qez0)

## Finding financial support

Today, some open source work is paid. A company may hire an individual to work full-time or part-time on a community open source project, or encourage employees to contribute during work hours. [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource) and [Rackspace](https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/) are two companies with these types of arrangements. Open source projects that originated at a company, such as [Go](https://github.com/golang) or [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), may also have paid employees.

Beyond arrangements for individual contributors, sometimes projects raise money from companies, individuals, or others to fund ongoing work. For example:

* @gaearon funded his work on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) through a [Patreon crowdfunding campaign](http://redux.js.org/)
* @indirect created [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), an organization that pays for work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler), [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), and other Ruby infrastructure projects

> The more contributors can live off their open-source work, the more they'll be able to devote to that work and the better their software will be for everyone. This is why we've been contributing funds to the open-source infrastructure we rely on. - Andreas Fuchs, [on why Stripe sponsors Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/)

As open source's popularity increases, availability of funding has not yet caught up to the need. If you are interested in finding funding for your open source work, there are some options available to you. Several popular options include:

* **Raise money for your work through crowdfunding campaigns or donations.** This strategy works well if you have a strong audience or reputation already, or your project is very popular.
* **Find a company to hire you to work on your idea**, or ask your current employer for dedicated work time.
* **Get a grant** to work on your project. Some software foundations and companies offer grants for open source work, such as the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/grants/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-2016).
* If you have a large project, **raise sponsorships from companies and individual donors** through a software foundation. Or **start a business** to support the project.

For more detailed options and case studies, @nayafia [wrote a guide](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) to getting paid for open source work. Different types of funding require different skills, so consider your strengths to figure out which option works best for you.

## Building a case for financial support

Whether your project is a new idea, or has been around for years, you should expect to put significant thought into identifying your target funder and making a compelling case. That means thinking about:

* **Impact:** Why is this project useful? Where will it be in five years?
* **Traction:** Try to collect evidence that your project matters, whether it's metrics, anecdotes, or testimonials. Are there any companies or noteworthy people using your project right now? If not, has a prominent person endorsed it?
* **Value to funder:** Funders are frequently approached with opportunities. Why should they fund your project over any other opportunity? How do they personally benefit?
* **Use of funds:** What, exactly, will you accomplish with the proposed funding? Focus on project milestones or outcomes rather than paying a salary.
* **How you'll receive the funds:** Does the funder have any requirements around disbursal? For example, you may need to be a nonprofit or have a nonprofit fiscal sponsor. Or perhaps the funds must be given to an individual contractor rather than an organization. These requirements vary between funders, so be sure to do your research beforehand.

For his Kickstarter campaign, @davegandy [made a video](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232193852/font-awesome-5) to explain why he raised funds for his project, [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome). The video not only included concrete examples of traction, but explained why he was raising money and what it would be used for:

> For years, we've been the leading resource of website friendly icons, with a community of over 20 million people and been featured on over 70 million websites, including Whitehouse.gov. Version 4 was three years ago. Web tech's changed a lot since then, and frankly, Font Awesome's gotten a bit stale. That's why we're introducing Font Awesome 5, a completely redesigned version...we're modernizing and rewriting the CSS and redesigning every icon from top to bottom. We're talking better design, better consistency, and better readability.

Raising money isn't easy, whether you're an open source project or a software startup. Identifying your target funder, doing your research, and putting yourself in their shoes to create a personalized pitch will help you build a convincing case for funding.
