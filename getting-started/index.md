## What does it mean to open source a project?

So you’re interested in making your project open source? Congratulations! 🎉 🙌 🌟 The world appreciates your contribution.

Before we get into the details of running and managing an open source project, let’s talk about what open sourcing a project actually means.

## Public projects on GitHub are not open source

When you publish a project on GitHub, you have the option to make the repository **private** or **public**. A public repository is not automatically open source unless you pick a license that grants a certain set of rights to people who might interact with your project.

Open source licenses grant permission to everyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to certain conditions, depending on the license.

Public repositories on GitHub [comply with GitHub’s Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/), which gives other people the right to view and fork your repository. But if you want others to use, copy, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use your GitHub project in their code, even if it’s public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so. (You can learn more about the legal side of open source [here](legal/).)

## Open source is more than just a license

Open source is defined by its legal protections and freedoms. In terms of culture, open sourcing a project has come to mean much more.

There are many reasons why a person or organization might want to open source a project. Some examples are:

* **Transparency:** Making your code visible means that anyone can inspect it for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like [Bulgaria](https://medium.com/@bozhobg/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a) or the [United States](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security-related software infrastructure like [Let’s Encrypt](https://github.com/letsencrypt).

* **Collaboration:** Projects that are open source can accept changes and updates from anybody. Collaboration matters to those who want to build their projects with a community, like [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). When people make improvements together, projects can thrive, because they draw from multiple skill sets, experiences, and levels of involvement.

* **Adoption and remixing:** Open source projects can be used by anyone for any purpose, whether it’s making a custom version of the original project, or using that project to build something else entirely. Code can reach more people when it is shared and reused, like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry). And new projects can grow out of older projects, like [WordPress and b2](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md), or [Jenkins and Hudson](https://github.com/jenkinsci).

Remember: open source isn’t just for software! You can open source everything from data sets to websites to books. Check out [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for ideas on what else you can open source.

When you open source a project, you open yourself to feedback and suggestions from other people who are engaged with your work. It might feel intimidating to open source a project for the first time, but remember that you’re not alone.

In the next section, we’ll help you figure out your goals around open sourcing your project. Understanding these goals beforehand will make it easier to manage your and others’ expectations later on.
