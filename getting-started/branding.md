You've thought about who your users are, what they need from you, and what you might be able to offer them. Next, we'll put that research into practice as we consider the brand of your project.

Branding may sound like a waste of time. After all, there are plenty of popular open source projects that have never thought about their brand at all.

But branding is more than a flashy logo or catchy project name. It's about how you talk about your project and who you reach with your message. Here are a few things you'll want to think about before you launch.

## Choosing the right name

Pick a name that is easy to remember and, ideally, gives some idea of what the project does. For example, [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) monitors apps for crash reporting, and [Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin) is a fast and simple Ruby web server.

Consider clarity above all. Puns are fun, but remember that some jokes might not translate to other cultures or people with different experiences from you. For example, some of your users might be employees; you don't want to make them uncomfortable when they have to explain your project's name to coworkers!

## Avoiding name conflicts

Make sure that your project's name doesn't infringe upon any trademarks. A company might ask you to take down your project later on, or even take legal action against you. It's just not worth the risk. You can check for U.S. trademark conflicts [here](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database). If you're at a company, this is one of the things your [legal team can help you with](../legal/#what-does-my-companys-legal-team-need-to-know).

You'll also want to look for open source projects with a similar name, especially if you share the same language or ecosystem. If your name overlaps with a popular existing project, you will confuse your audience and make it less likely that anyone will use what you've created. You can check for similar project names [here](http://ivantomic.com/projects/ospnc/).

Consider whether you'll want a website, Twitter handle, or other properties to represent your project. If so, make sure you can get the names you want. Ideally, reserve those names now so you have peace of mind. You can check for domain name availability [here](https://instantdomainsearch.com/).

Finally, it doesn't hurt to do a quick Google search for your project name. Will people be able to easily find your project? Does something else appear in the search results that you wouldn't want them to see?

## How you write (and code) affects your brand, too!

Throughout the life of your project, you'll do a lot of writing: READMEs, tutorials, community documents, responding to issues, maybe even newsletters and mailing lists. Whether it's official documentation or a casual email, how you write contributes to the brand of a project. Consider how you might come across to your audience and whether that is the tone you wish to convey.

@janl discovered that the way he spoke to others helped create a positive brand for [CouchDB](https://github.com/apache/couchdb):

> When I started out at CouchDB and we finally joined the ASF \[Apache Software Foundation\] and it was standard procedure to have a user@ mailing list for end-user support, I remembered my days in the #php channel and decided that that's not the culture I want to have there. So for the first three or so years, I tried to be involved with every thread on the mailing list, and showing exemplary behaviour, being nice to people, taking their issues seriously and trying to be helpful overall. After a while, people stuck around not to only ask questions, but to help with the answering as well, and to my complete delight, they mimicked my style. \[...\]

> Every time I join and read, I see the culture that I helped plant there seven years ago and it makes me very proud. [^1]

Beyond how you write words, your coding style may also become part of your project's brand. For example, [Angular](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) and [jQuery](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) are two projects with rigorous coding styles and guidelines.

It isn't necessary to write a style guide for your project when you're just starting out, and you may find that you enjoy incorporating different coding styles into your project anyway. But you should anticipate how your writing (and coding) style might attract (or not attract) different types of people. The earliest stages of your project are your opportunity to set the precedent you wish to see.

We're almost there! Next, we'll walk you through a few components that every open source project should include when you launch.
