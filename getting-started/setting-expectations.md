There are many reasons to open source a project. It’s a good idea to figure out yours before going public with your project. What you want to get out of the experience will guide how you manage your project and help you figure out where to say yes (and no!).

In this section, we’ll help you think through a few important questions about the goals of your project.

## Define your goals

Let’s start by defining your goals. Simply put: *why are you open sourcing this project?*

There is no one right answer to this question. You may find that you have multiple goals for a single project, or that different projects have different goals. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself.

Here are some examples of reasons why people open source their work:

* An individual wants to show off his or her portfolio
* An individual or company wants others to use what they’ve created
* A community wants to find collaborators to shape the project and help it grow
* An individual wants to get feedback on their work
* A company wants make their code transparent

## Figure out what you need from others

Once you’ve listed out your goals, ask yourself: *for each of these goals, what do I (or we) need from others?*

For example, if you are open sourcing a project to build your portfolio, you may not be actively looking for contributions, or you don’t have time to review them. In that case, you might clearly state in your README that you are not accepting contributions.

**(add an example, e.g.: https://github.com/infinite-scroll/infinite-scroll or https://github.com/dboehmer/hotelres)**

On the other hand, if you are building a community project, you may be very actively looking for contributors. In this case, you might want to be more detailed about the types of contributions you’re looking for and explicitly give your readers permission to modify and shape the project.

**(add an example, e.g. https://github.com/Level/levelup#contributing)**

If you’re hoping to get feedback on something you’ve created, consider asking for the type of feedback you’re looking for, whether it’s general code review or help with a specific bug.

**(add an example, e.g.: https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder#known-issue)**

## Figure out what others need from you

Finally, open sourcing a project is a two-way street. People who use your project will probably ask you for things, too.

Try to anticipate these needs beforehand so you can add them to your project from the beginning. Successful open source projects try to document as much as they can in public. Much like reusable pieces of code, reusable information means less people need to ask you the same questions over and over again. (That means less work for you!)

Remember that as your project grows, your users may need more than just code from you. Responding to issues, reviewing code, and evangelizing your project are all important tasks in an open source project. While the amount of time you spend on non-coding tasks will depend on the size and scope of your project, you should be prepared as a maintainer to address them yourself or find someone to help you.

Here are some questions to ask yourself early on. If you don’t know the answers, consider how you might be able to figure them out (for example, polling others online or reading through forums where your users might congregate).

* Does the project’s name resonate with my audience? Will they remember it or think it is clever?
* What are the skills and background of my audience? Do they need to know anything special about how to use my project?
* Where might my users feel frustrated? Can I (or we) make it easier somehow?
* Will my users need extra help or support anywhere?
* How does this project compare to other projects that my audience might be familiar with?

## Save your answers, you’ll need them!

Congratulations, you just did your first round of user research for your project! If you wrote down the answers to the above questions, save them for later. You can reference your goals and expectations as you develop your project.

We’ll also use these answers in the next section, as you consider the brand of your project.
