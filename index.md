Welcome to the Open Source Handbook! We created this handbook to help creators like you successfully release and grow your projects.

We wrote this handbook based on what we've learned from watching millions of open source projects on GitHub's platform. Whether you're an individual, a company, or a community, you'll find plenty of real stories and experiences in this handbook to guide you.

Special thanks to **(list names of people here)** for their valuable input in the initial release of this handbook. If you'd like to contribute, head on over to to get started!
