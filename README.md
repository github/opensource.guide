# Open Source Guides
[![Build Status](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/workflows/GitHub%20Actions%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/actions)

Open Source Guides (https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project.

## Background
Open Source Guides were created and are curated by GitHub, along with input from outside community reviewers, but they are not exclusive to GitHub products. One reason we started this project is that we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open-source projects.

Our goal was to aggregate community best practices, *not* what GitHub (or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we used examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.

## Features

Open Source Guides is a comprehensive resource aimed at helping individuals, communities, and organizations successfully participate in and manage open source projects. The repository offers the following key features:

### 1. Comprehensive Guides
A collection of in-depth, topic-based guides covering a wide range of open source practices and concepts. These guides are designed to educate contributors, maintainers, and organizations on essential open source topics, such as:

- Starting an open source project
- Best practices for maintaining projects
- Understanding open source licensing and legal considerations
- Building and nurturing inclusive communities
- Improving project documentation
- Managing governance and leadership in open source

### 2. Community-Driven Content
Content is collaboratively developed and reviewed by the open source community and experts. Contributions are encouraged from anyone, ensuring that the guides reflect best practices and diverse perspectives.

### 3. Contributor Guidelines
Clear and accessible [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help new and experienced contributors get involved, propose changes, and participate in discussions around open source practices.

### 4. Multi-Language Support
Guides are translated into multiple languages to make open source knowledge accessible globally. Community members can contribute translations or improvements to existing ones.

### 5. Open Licensing
All content is released under the [Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), making it easy to share, adapt, and reuse the material in other projects or educational resources.

A robust [issue tracker](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/issues) allows users to report bugs, suggest topics, request improvements, and discuss ideas with maintainers and the community.

### 8. Continuous Integration
Automated workflows ensure that all contributions are reviewed and tested before being merged, maintaining the quality and reliability of the published guides.
